"today we had dinner at noodles restaurant where we walked in without a prior reservation n da restaurant staff were very accomdative.. Food was really good n was served with really quickly,, we are happy to be back at CG ",25-Jul-19

This is a huge and very special hotel that has high standards in its bedrooms with lots of toiletries and a bowl of fresh fruit in your room too.The gym is not huge but there is sufficient equipment that is in good working order. The pool is large and has a towel service and a member of staff is on duty over seeing pool safety. You can order food from the pool bar and it can be served directly to your sun lounger or you can eat it sat at tables in the shade. The staff are very accommodating.The hotel has good moral standards. I saw a young lady walk into the large spacious reception area with 2 of her friends and she was wearing swimwear. She was immediately approached by a staff member and asked to leave the area due to her poor dress state and asked not to traverse the public areas again dressed only in swimwear.Well done Cinnamon Grand.,18-Jun-19

Been here couple of times and what i noticed it they are always consistent with the food and service. Mr.Thushara is exceptional with his costumer service skills and always provide us with the best dining experience by taking of the hassle of thinking too hard on what to oder. I highly recommend you request for him and ask him to help you with the menu if you have no idea waht to oder. This time visit was special because we decided to go there for a close friends birthday dinner and having just mention that whily reserving our table Mr.Thushara and his team surprised us with a cake towards the end of our meals. It was really nice of them. Noodles has always been great. Absolutely value for money.   ,24-Jul-19

"Yes when I had the taste bud for some good authentic Sri Lankan food , had the opportunity to try out the dinner at Nuga gama . What more being a typical Sri Lankan can look for ? The variety from hoppers , stringhoppers to other local dishes such as pittu and pol rotti it was a very deliscious array of good food . And the service of the staff was overwhelming and yes the ambience of the restaurant is a win win Any one who would like to try the very own Sri Lankan culture and local cuisine - Nugagama at cinnoman is a must try",24-Jul-19

An absolutely amazing authentic experience eating dinner at Nugagama. Family friendly and very helpful staff add the ease of dining. It's got a tropical feel with the 5 star amenities. The selection of food was very Sri Lankan but also had milder curry dishes and the hoppers were the best of all. I highly recommend this restaurant and the hotel which has exceeded all my expectations.,24-Jul-19

"We can easily say choosing Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand as our wedding reception venue was the best decision we’ve made during our planning. The staff was beyond helpful, all the guests felt looked after and cared for, and most importantly they were punctual in providing the hall, rooms, and amenities. The food was exceptionally delicious. The banquets office was ever so helpful during our planning in providing the utmost support and going out of their way to address our every concern.

"The great ambience, good coffee and the amazingly friendly staff at cinnamon grand coffee stop makes it one of the unique coffee shops in colombo. Specially I love to visit during the times when the piano man is playing at the lobby, it's really refreshing and helps to get off the stress of work. I frequently visit coffee stop to get a change of scenery to get my work done. It has been nothing but a great experience for me every time I visit. I can't remember the names of all the nice people in the staff, but curator Vijay is one of the really friendly guys who would come and talk to the customers to see how everything is going. This is another thing that makes this place unique. It's not just another coffee shop with a friendly staff, they treat you like you stepped into their home to have a cup of coffee.",22-Jul-19

Come and enjoy new experience It was wonderful outing for my wife and I when visited Lagoon restaurant at cinnamon for dinner where the restaurant had to offer their new dining concept for two on top of the pond with glass deck surrounded by nature having the utmost peaceful surrounding where you can really enjoy an evening in heart of Colombo.As usual the restaurant manager Mr. Ranjith and the team really gives you the best of their effort to make your visit so comfortable and a enjoyable dining experience everytime you visit.

"The top ratings the Cinnamon Grand has on Trip Advisor are absolutely justified - it really is as wonderful as everyone says! It is calm, beautiful, and you are made to feel so special by every member of staff. For example I couldn't decide what to order from the amazing menu at Chutneys restaurant, so the chef made me a bespoke curry which was delicious. The Breeze Bar next to the pool is tranquil and beautiful. The breakfast in the Courtyard is the perfect way to start a day - lots of fruit and omelettes made just how you want. Special mention of Taniya at reception who made me feel so welcome on my arrival (I was stressed, dirty and exhausted after a long haul flight, and within 2 minutes of presenting myself at the CG reception desk I had recovered my sense of self-worth and felt human again!), and Dilshan at the coffee shop.",18-Jul-19

I'd like to tell you a story about the Great Cinnamon Service...... Previous to reaching this hotel I stayed at Cinnamon Lodge Habarana and left behind 3 shirts. Knowing that I would be at Cinnamon Grand some days later I rang the hotel and asked if it was possible to have the shirts sent on to Cinnamon Grand. Not only did they send the shirts on but they also had them laundered and they were hanging up in the closet of my allocated room. Service with a smile My thanks go to Meliissa at Cinnamon Lodge and Tharika at Cinnamon Grand for coordinating the effort. Special mention to Leeza and Taniya at the front desk who make me feel like I am coming home. Upali in the Breeze bar and of course Merril who greets us regulars like long lost friends. It was nice to see Kularuwan again in the Courtyard Cafe who remembers my quirky breakfast requests and treats me like a princess. Much gratitude..Bohoma Isthuthi.Finally on check out top marks to Yasir (Trainee) who handled all my queries with efficiency and professionalism. Well done. I will be back in December to enjoy this wonderful hotel that is recovering from the Easter Sunday incident. Wishing the new Manager all the best. I know this place will continue to grow and flourish. See you soon CG.,18-Jul-19

"When entering the premises it did a proper security check to ensure that we all are safe and enjoying our food which was handled with very corporative team and they were very much pleasant the way they took care of us.So I selected chutneys as they have lovely dishes on mutton and prawns mainly and also the mutton Briyani is best in town. If you tell them which level of spice and grave you want they will ensure your order is delivered in the same way. The team lead by Anthony Francis , pratap and Gayan buddhika provided an excellent overwhelming experience it’s like you ar taken care at your home by your parents and I was with my parents and I wanted to feel them the same and surely they did. They were relaxed and felt warmly welcomed by the team.From the starters to I loved the mix of taste they gave us to tease our taste buds and leading to bonda and wadey we were soo full even by starters but the smell of th biryanis and the dosai made us to eat the rest ❤️. I loved everything about here the food and the choice of food the suggestions they made for me when selecting food was very useful. Ppl don’t forget to order their prawn curry it’s lovely and heavenly I am feeling you..And with all these spices order a chai tea as well or else get them to surprise you with the choice of the dessert this people knows the best So it was the end of these very lovely time filled with amazing food, amazing and homely people Francis prathap and buddhika gayan and anoj You all made the day after a busy week !!Love CInnamon Grand and love chutneys to the best and to bits ❤️❤️",12-Jul-19

"Cinnamon Grand has always been my favourite and we were really glad to be back to enjoy the International Sunday Brunch at The Courtyard on the 7th of July.  Although, the Easter aftermath took its toll, I wish to applaud the Management for the security measures taken to make the guests feel safe and comfortable at all times.  Professionalism and hospitality has always been a well known factor at Cinnamon and even this time we were warmly greeted at the entrance by Ms. Melanie Ann followed by a welcome drink and not forgetting Mr. Mangala whose friendly nature made us feel homely.  The Sunday Brunch was extremely impressive and prepared with precision to tantalize every taste-bud. We really enjoyed a wide array of sumptuous food and beverages and would personally suggest that any guest should not miss this as it's value for money.  While wishing the management and the staff all success and would definitely recommend Cinnamon Grand to all the guests who would love to enjoy true  Sri Lankan hospitality.",10-Jul-19

"After 15 years my family all came back to Sri Lanka to introduce my sister's husband (american) to our country. Though we were all raised in America, we had high hopes for a full Sri Lankan experience and the Cinnamon Grand didn't disappoint. For my parents, this hotel was extra special because they were married in it 35 years ago. Rooms were very modern (similar to a Marriott room) with lounge chairs, office desks and bathroom amenities like any american hotel. The breakfast buffet was SUBURB. My brother-in-law has Celiacs disease and the restaurant chef went out of his way the night before to prepare special food because my brother-in-law LOVES Sri Lankan food. The entire restaurant was so excited to serve us and truly was generous in their hospitality. The entire hotel was incredibly kind and honestly, it will be the service we remember the most. Thank you for hosting us!",3-Jul-19

"On my way to India decided to spend 24 hours in Colombo to see the change if any after the tragedy. I was there for the first time just before the bombing and decided to see for myself. On arriving I was greeted like a long lost Uncle. The smiles, professionalism and the steely nature of the staff made me feel I am truly safe here. Security is the best anywhere and I would hold a convention here tomorrow with complete assurance I was absolutely in the hands of the finest group of men and women heroes and that I can travel freely anywhere. The executive lounge staff brilliant, new manager and sales team to welcome you and the restaurants still serving the best foods in Sri Lanka. Oh and finally Colombo is totally safe and secure I walked everywhere and the people are smiling, friendly and want you all back. So if you are hesitant please don’t be because the adventure begins at the Cinnamon Hotels and you will never get a better deal than now.",21-Jun-19

"We went here for the dinner. From the time of entering the restaurant , we experienced none other than great hospitality and politeness. Now they have placed their tables outside the restaurant so that you could have your meal in tranquility. Great ambience too. Soothing music from the background really is a honey drop to the ears. Service was great. We were immediately provided with the menus and and food arrived within 15 minutes. That's just wow I would say. One of the Fastest we've ever experienced. Food was scrumptious and succulent. It was mouth wateringly delicious. We finished our dishes in no time. Nirosh , who served us was very polite and prompt and friendly. He even offered us green tea after the meals without even asking for those. Just great service. Also the lady executive ( couldn't recall the name) was very friendly and inquired regularly whether our expectations met.Not only from us , but from all the guests. That's how true customer service is. Overall great food, great people and great place . We would definitely visit here again. Keep up the good work guys. Cheers !!!",19-Jun-19

"I cannot speak highly enough of my friends at the cinnamon grand. at a recent stay I recall one of the staff at the Cinnamon Grand saying to me as I left, “Mr Carl, this is your home in Sri Lanka.” While it seems odd to regard a 5-star hotel with such affection, after staying there some 250 nights over many years, this is certainly true. The venue for countless formal and informal Deakin University events, the CG has built up a superb knack for hospitality. Recent events provide a salient reminder of how connected we all are, and indeed what a small and connected place Sri Lanka is. I was fortunate enough to visit again recently. The professionalism, warmth and humanity extended to me is not easily forgotten. Heartfelt Thanks folks. Carl",18-Jun-19

"Beautiful restaurant with world class service and food presentation. There were only 4-5 fully vegan operations (2 appetizers and 3 soups) which is a bit surprising given it's a Noodles restaurant.

I am so glad to see Cinnamon Grand back in action once again. The hotel has been one of my default destinations when it comes to dining. What I love about Cinnamon Grand is that they have outlets for all budgets. I have been lucky enough to visit most of their restaurants. But my favorite has to be Noodles.Firstly the food is absolutely out of this world. I have never eaten a better Laksa anywhere else in the world. And the prices are surprisingly low for a five star hotel. In fact it is far cheaper than most wayside Chinese Restaurants in Colombo. And as an added bonus they also do great cocktails. When I heard about the Easter Sunday Explosion at the Taprobane I was heart broken. As I used to frequent the lunch and dinner buffet at that location. The manager whose life was taken by the explosion was someone I liked a lot due to his friendly personality.But I am glad that the hotel has reopened and wish them all success.,16-Jun-19

"Finally back in Colombo at my favorite hotel, the Cinnamon Grand, just two months after the terror hit the place with full strength. It is amazing that they have kept the hotel open all the time. Now all facilities except the Thai restaurant are open, and staff is more friendly, attentive and service minded than ever before. And the fantastic sea food restaurant is as good as, or even better than before. Too bad it is still a bit quiet. These brave people need all our support not to allow for the terrorists to win, so if you have not booked your summer vacation yet, come to Colombo and stay at the Cinnamon Grand, you will not regret it. all the time.

Good stuff #CinnamonGrand Cheers!!",14-Jun-19

Attentive and hospitable staff. Security is tight (but I'm not complaining) because of the Easter Sunday bombing but the hotel has gotten back her feet.

"Cinnamon grand has been one of my haunts in Colombo and the restaurant Noodles has been a strong favorite. The service here is wonderful and the food never disappoints. One of my favorites here is the Laksa, which is just right amount of spice (I've posted a picture). But saying that, everything I have had here as been amazing. The service, like i mentioned is very professional and the waiters are very accommodating. If you have a reluctance to eat mushrooms for example, like my son does, you can always explain to a waiter and he will make sure there isn't a trace of it in your dish.Visit Cinnamon Grand and Noodles today!#BackAtCG#BackAtCG",13-Jun-19

"Taking in the last few hours I have left here in Sri Lanka before I head off to India Traveling through Sri Lanka has been a breath taking experience. I have met some amazing people who have made me feel so welcome in this beautiful country and seen some incredible landscapes. Highlights of the trip has got to be pottering sessions in village , most of all meeting some of the kindest people .It’s been very eye opening coming to Sri Lanka after the horrific bombings that occurred over Easter this year. These events have heavily effected the people all over Sri Lanka in ways that I could never have imagined. Before the bombings happened, Sri Lanka was rated as the worlds top tourist destination and the future for the economy was looking bright. After speaking to locals in the tourism industry, almost 80% of tourists pulled out of their trips to Sri Lanka after the bombings happened. This has left hotels, hostels, restaurants and tourist attractions empty.My stay in cinnamon Grand is amazing I feel safe Talking to Priyadarshana he told me trajectory of the Sri Lanken economy is looking grim, and the only thing they asked of us is to spread the word of how incredible Sri Lanka is and how safe we felt when we have been here. People are still in shock here after what happened and unfortunately this country does not have the ability to bounce back as quickly as others might. I encourage anyone who is considering coming to Sri Lanka to just get amongst it as it benefits these people more than you think. Plus its very clear why this was one of the top tourist destinations in the world!",5-Jun-19
