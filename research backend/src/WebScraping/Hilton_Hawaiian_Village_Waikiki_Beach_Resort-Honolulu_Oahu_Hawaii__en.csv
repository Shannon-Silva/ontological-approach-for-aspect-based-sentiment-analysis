"We had an ocean view room on the side looking towards Waikiki Beach. Stunning! We really loved the pool reserved for Alii tower guests. We spent most of our time there or on beach. The fireworks were great from there. The main pools were crowded and difficult to find chairs. Fortunately, our kids are older so no longer a concern. Food was expensive but easily available. There were all kinds of places to eat at on the resort. I would go back if staying that tower.","July 24, 2019"
"We used our points for an ocean front room in the Rainbow tower. Best vacation idea in a very long time. We could sit on the lanai and see the sea turtles swimming around while people swam by them unaware. We did the same thing later snorkeling. It’s hard to see them unless they poke their heads up next to you. It was easy to rent umbrellas and chairs, floaties and more. The Hilton is a huge property with its own village. When our luggage took a side trip, we loved the easy access to ABC stores. You can get just about anything there. The ice cream shop on site is wonderful but often has long lines. Timing is everything. We ate at CJ’s for breakfast and dinner. It’s not a hotel restaurant but in the village. Delicious. You could stay on the property and never leave. You could but you should not:) It’s within walking distance of all the shops and restaurants. We even walked to the Ala Moana mall, but there is a bus stop right there at the hotel that will get you there quick. There is a car rental place across the street. As for the room, it was nice. We had two double beds so ordered a roll alway too so everyone wouldn’t be too crowded. Registration can be a wait so I’d recommend digital registration. ","May 31, 2019"
"Very disappointed... Most of the staff was rude and seemed annoyed if you asked a question. I actually got an eye roll and sigh when I asked an employee who happened to be changing a garbage pail where I could get towels for the beach. Upon check in, I waited on the Hilton honors line. It was around 1:00 in the afternoon. A line of people were waiting but there was not an employee to be found???? 6 computers with nobody at them??? With the amount of people checking in you would think every station would be manned.. after waiting ten plus minutes finally only ONE employee arrived at the desk! The next day I went to to the check in desk to ask a question about my bill. The person at the desks first response was “you should have asked that yesterday when you checked in”.. I explained it was a crazy check in process and did not have time. She seemed annoyed.. finally, the grounds seemed dirty and run down and not taken care off. The Hilton Hawaiian village sign by the water fall looked filthy... how about having an employee wipe it down everyday so it looks presentable... will not be back..","July 24, 2019"
"We spent 2 nights at the Hawaiin Village before going on a cruise. We arrived at 5 PM on July 4th and our friends were in the regular check-in area and we were in the Alli Tower check in and both were not crowded, quick and friendly. Staff was welcoming and upgraded our room to a beautiful ocean view suite! What a great way to begin a vacation. We ate at Tropics with its beautiful beach view and then watched the fireworks. We were doing a lot of sightseeing, so we did not use the resort activities much during our 2 day stay. It was convenient to have nearby shops, walk the beautiful beach and enjoy a comfortable bed to get over jet-lag. We were very pleased with the room and the service. Alli is definitely smaller and less hectic. The Alli pool was amazing. Mahalo for a great stay in Wiakiki","July 23, 2019"
 The staff was nice and the hotel was beautiful but my experience was tarnished by the multiple power outages that occurred at the property. It was an absolute nightmare walking up and down twenty flights of stairs in the humid heat with my two small children. For the three thousand dollars I paid to stay at this well renowned resort that was not acceptable and when I checked out and spoke with management they didn’t seem too concerned with my frustration. My family and I had several rooms there celebrating our anniversary and my mother’s 50th birthday and we are all very displeased with what occurred and the emotionless response we received.,"July 23, 2019"
When we arrived there was a glitch with our originally booked room not being ready on the first day. Staff worked to make up for the mistake and we were able to check into our originally booked room the next day. Our room was a corner ocean front room with two balconies and the views were spectacular. The Friday night fireworks show was fun to watch off of our balcony. We felt staff members were very attentive. We would recommend this property and would stay here again.,"July 23, 2019"
"We love the Rainbow Tower and we are always upgraded. Christmas time is magical at the resort. Excellent customer service, clean rooms, top notch restaurants. The pools are clean and decks are well-maintained.Always a dream!","July 23, 2019"
"I have spent five days in this hotel/resort during an international conference in June. After a fast check-in It wasassigned to me a big room in the Tapa Tower. Clean an tidy as expected. During the second or third day, water started to come from the ceiling of the bathroom. After a quick call to maintenance and customer support, the assigned room was changed to another one in the Kalia Tower. No problem there.Excluding the water leakage problem (not expected in an Hilton level hotel), it was a beautiful stay (even if for work). The waterfront and pools are amazing and there are a lot of restaurant where have a dinner or a lunch. Surely the resort is huge and is crowded, but It is the cost to pay to stay this Hilton historical landmark.","July 22, 2019"
"and once again we had a great time. Very nice, with incredible view of Diamond Head. As a Gold Hhonors member who registered online, my checkin was easy and efficient, and took only a few minutes. I did note however that others were waiting in very long lines. This is a big, bustling and busy hotel, but we enjoy the location, the beach, all of the shopping and activities on site, and the access to all of the great dining that Waikiki and Honolulu offer. True, this is not cheap, and it is painful that on top of parking and resort fees, that they still charge a hefty premium for a chair and umbrella. We found buying a cheap chair at the ABC store paid for itself in a day. Since our last visit there was only one thing that made me unhappy and that is the breakfast benefit for Gold HHonors members. Historically, you would receive the continental breakfast and paid an up charge for the full buffet. Now, the hotel offers $10 per person a day, max of $20 day credit. $10 does not even pay for a fraction of the continental buffet, and I would challenge the management to find any venue on the property where 10 bucks would get anything close to breakfast. This is a serious downgrade of the Hilton Hhonors benefit.That aside, I have no reservations in recommending this hotel. Enjoy all that it has to offer.","July 22, 2019"
"Arrived at the resort on a Monday at about 2:00 pm. Stood in line to check in for over an hour. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower on the very top, 31st floor. Very nice room, but shows signs of needing some updating 9wall paper peeling, carpet old, balcony door didn't lock properly. Day two was aweful. The city had a power outage that affect the entire resort at about 11:00 am. The power was restored to the resort about 1:00 pm but not the Rainbow Tower! We had no access to our room for over 8 hours. They had a service elevator working and the line to use that was over 100 guest at any given time.Yet the resort continued to check folks in. Bottom line, the power came back on in the Tower at about 8:45 pm. Hilton only gave us a mere $75 credit after we asked for concideration. You would think the beach would be free. No, $18 for a beach chair rental per day, per guest and $36 umbrella rental per day. That is outrageous.All that money we spent and HIlton charges for chairs and umbrellas? I expected more from a classly organization than this. They did give us free beach towels (the same towels we used in the rooms, not really a beach towel). The resort was also EXTREMELY crowded. Just too many people to really enjoy yourself. They do everything they can do to keep you on the 22 acres of the resort. For all the resort fees that we paid, still don't know what I got for that, when they charged us for everything!","July 22, 2019"
"We have stayed with the HIlton Hawaiian Village a couple times now and it's become our go to when visiting Honolulu. We have stayed in the Tapa Tower and the Ali'l Tower and both have been amazing. Very clean, comfortable rooms with excellent views. There are a number of pools that one can swim in all over the resort (with a exclusive pool only for those that stay in the Ali'i Tower) and the BEACH!!! Beautiful sandy beach with no rocks to step on as you wade out into the water. The beach is busy but hey.... it's Waikiki Beach. If you're expecting to sit on the beach, etc with no one around you're visiting the wrong island. Or wait until 10pm ish :)","July 22, 2019"
"We stayed in the Ali’i Tower with our two kids for our anniversary. When we first got to the Hilton, we pulled up to the check in area and it looked super hectic. There were long lines to check in around 1PM, but the bellhop was great and efficiently gathered our luggage and was somehow able to bring it to our room despite the chaos.We parked our car in the lot across from the Kalia Tower ($45 night) and walked over to the Ali’i Tower to check in. It felt a bit like a boutique hotel with a much quieter check in area compared to the main lobby. Gary was very helpful and we were upgraded to an ocean view room (booked a partial ocean view). The Ali'i Tower feels like a boutique hotel in the middle of the Hilton. The room was more upscale and I loved the toiletries. We also took advantage of the coffee and hot chocolate pods. The maid did a great job with cleaning the room and refreshing all of the pods, water, and toiletries. The Hilton is rather crowded since there are so many towers, but the pools didn't feel too crowded. I was able to find a chair near the pool, albeit it was in the blistering sun. We did the stand up paddle board in the quiet lagoon, which the kids enjoyed. There were various happy hours throughout the property, so we were able to save a little money here and there. Overall, it was a great stay, though it didn't feel very Hawaiian. It was perfect for our kids, but I was glad to split our time between here and Ko Olina. ","July 20, 2019"
"Room 1012 overlooks the beach and adjoining park. The room provides sufficient storage and closet space. The bathroom is sectioned into 3 separate areas. The vanity and closet area includes lower shelves for one's toiletries. Personally, I think the bathtub should have been eliminated in the most recent upgrade. A dedicated shower would work better in the space. The lobby is small compared to the number of rooms in the property. The workout facility off the second floor pool area is very small. According to my recollection, there are 3 treadmills, maybe one eliptical, some free weights and an exercise ball. Space to use the ball is tiny. Literally, I have experienced larger and better equipped facilities at Hilton Garden Inns and Marriott Courtyards. The staff were friendly. Housekeeping made our room up in the morning every day. We do tip generously in cash, which seems to endear us to housekeeping wherever we stay. I must add that there was no evidence that our balcony area was cleaned.As soon as one leaves the Ali I tower, thousands of people jam the walkways. The landscaping is lovely, but difficult to enjoy in the crush.Many families stayed in the tower and the screaming, crying and racing in the halls by the children was tiresome. Given the size of the property, setting aside a floor or two for adults only might be a winning idea. We won't return because of the noise issue.","July 20, 2019"
We stayed in a two bedroom in the Lagoon Tower. Great location - close to Ala Moana shopping and the beach. Lots of pools to choose from - we loved to get away to the over 18 pool for some peace and quiet. IHOP across the road. Good pizza place on site. And only 10 minute walk to Waikiki main strip of shops and eateries. This is a great location for families and with a full kitchen in the unit we were able to self- cater breakfasts and lunches. Hint - ocean view is not the same as ocean front view! We have a nice side view with our ocean view room but we stayed ocean front last time and that was definitely preferable. The Lagoon Tower is my pick in the village - away from the hustle and bustle of the main pool and shops etc.,"July 20, 2019"
"I stayed in both the Ali'i and Tapa Towers. The room in the Ali,i was alright but had a problem with the doorbell system. Tapa tower room was old and had a broken ironing board. I have stayed at this hotel since 1992 and it seems that some of it's qualities have been reduced. There was no real benefit to staying in Ali'i as it used to be for the value. Parking was $52 dollars for valet services. I was not as impressed as I had been staying there. All that said, I was glad to see friends that I have known since the early '90s still there and that made for a pleasant experience as I was able to catch up with the Hilton as it is today from their perspective.","July 20, 2019"
"When we arrive, there was a huge line for check in but fortunately with Hilton Honors check in was way faster. We stayed in the Kalia Tower - room was smaller than normal and a bit outdated,housekeeping did not come daily,fridge was located in the bathroom which was odd.the queen beds were more of a full size bed.The resort did not have much dining options that were reasonable price.One night electricity went out and dining/shopping establishments had to close which was inconvenient.","July 20, 2019"
Large portions. Rather expensive and for me not worth the price. We shared the bowls which was allowed. Nice friendly staff and good service. Clean facility but the music was rather loud and over the top.,"July 20, 2019"
"Stayed four nights, and our impressions are not that great. We were grateful to get an early check in but that was the only highlight. Staff were so offhand. No greeting, very slow service everywhere apart from Tropics. My husband broke his toe and when I asked the front desk to borrow scissors to cut his bandage I was told ‘no, they’re my scissors and I need them’ even though I explained why I needed to borrow them. No offer to source some, just a shut down. Your staff are letting you down Hilton. A smile and a friendly greeting from people who expect to be tipped should not be difficult. Everyone else in Hawaii seems to be able to manage it.","July 20, 2019"
While this hotel is well positioned right on the beach it is not the best serviceChecking in at 3.30PM took over 45 minutes of standing in line and at the counter. Some people had stood in line for over an hour they said. There is just too many people for the counters Very poor and frustrating Our room in Tapa Tower wasn't well cleaned with dirt on the floor including a hair pin and sand The room is getting dated and a bit dingy By the time we got down to the beach the first day nearing 5PM the beach stand was closing down so no beach towels to be had The chairs were already packed up so an evening paddle after our 10 hour flight wasn't to be had even tho the sun was up for another 3 hours ..Overall this large complex is too big too crowded and to expensive and not worth it!!,"July 19, 2019"
"We stayed here for 6 nights, in the Tapa Tower. For the same room rate, friends got the Ali’i Tower, with restaurant priority - we’re all Gold Honours members, how come we got the scruffy tower?!!The site is huge. The location is lovely, beautiful beach, very clean. But they charge you around $50 a day to hire a chair and umbrella. There’s absolutely no shade, so you NEED an umbrella. The pools are pretty crowded too, and again, no umbrellas. What IS this problem with umbrellas? It’s a safety issue, guys, not a luxury. No adult pool, so all pools full of screaming kids.There are plenty of food outlets, and the Tropic is good value. Prices are very high, but Hawaii is expensive, unless you go where the locals eat.The shops are interesting, good variety, but again expensive, except for ABC, which was a lifesaver.Staff were not particularly helpful unless they were trying to sell you something. Then you had to shake them off your ankles, they would NOT let go.We were entitled to $20 off our food bill each day, as Gold Honours members. Got the bill, no discount. We weren’t letting that one go. If it took 2 hours standing in line, we were getting that discount. Which we did, immediately, when we queried it, but we were left with the feeling that the Management hoped we wouldn’t notice and would go for express checkout because of the long lines.To be fair, the hotel is obviously popular with a lot of people, it just wasn’t our type of place. But if you’re going to charge premium rates, you should provide premium service.","July 19, 2019"
"This hotel has an amazing location. I will give it that. Like other reviews, I found the rooms to be outdated and dingy. There was paint chipped off the walls from our 12th floor Rainbow tower room. I mean, really? I'm talking big chunks of paint. Not a deal breaker, but it certainly lowered the quality. The carpet is worn and the bathroom shower needs some attention. We stayed at 3 different properties during our stay in Hawaii and this was our least favorite and least Hawaiian feeling. It just felt like another hotel and was nothing special. Also the entire complex is a zoo. We kind of expected that, but just be warned. With it being right on the beach in Waikiki you can't beat it the location, but just expect less and prepare for crowds.","July 19, 2019"
"The Village was a perfect location for my family, beautiful stretch of beach, multiple pools to choose from, nice variety of restaurants, & wonderful shops. It was crowded but I really only felt it when using the elevators at certain times of the day and when events ended (fireworks, luau). We were fortunate to stay in the Tapa Tower (corner suite 1229) where we watched the fireworks show in privacy! We also saw the most amazing full rainbow one morning. We chose a different luau (Paradise Cove) as sitting on a rooftop was not appealing to us. However, it would have been more convenient as Paradise Cove is pretty far from the Village and took 5 hours of our time. I highly recommend CJ’s for breakfast, shaved ice at the Wiki Wiki, and lunch or dinner at Tropics on the beach. Sushi at Hatsumara was pretty good and it was nice to get take-out pizza from Round Table. The wait times for restaurants was reasonable, no more than 15 minutes. Meal prices are pretty high but I suppose average for Hawaii. There are some off site eateries within walking distance but I did see long lines. Honestly I’d rather pay a little more and not have to deal with long lines in the heat and humidity. One really doesn’t have to leave the resort! Service throughout the resort was wonderful, super friendly staff. Fees for extras was a little high...especially beach chairs and umbrellas ($18/$34 each) Make sure you plan for at least a 1/2 day at the beach to get your money’s worth. Pools are pretty crowded but we always managed to find a spot to lay out. We used the on site National Car Rental one day, but booked prior to arrival. Our vehicle was ready and waiting for us as requested. We opted for an alternate airport shuttle (Hawaii23) over Speedi’s based on previous reviews. Hawaii23 was awesome, on time, friendly driver, private transport, and flat rate ($37 for 4 people). We also used the on site medical clinic as my husband felt ill. Great service here as well. Just had to get Rx filled at a nearby pharmacy. Overall, I highly recommend the Village for families, our 2 teenagers had an incredible time...especially parasailing with Hawaiian Parasail (a short walk around the Lagoon). They are not affiliated with the Village but also provided excellent service. Mahalo!","July 19, 2019"
"we are in the middle of our stay and things we have noticed so far: nice location near beach and shopping, restaurants. there are people everywhere- it is literally a zoo. so so crowded. prob one of the most touristy places i have ever stayed (i am attending a conference here). walls are thin- we hear all kinds of knocks and bangs and housekeeping things. the rooms are super outdated. the outside is dirty too. our ""ocean view"" room is more like a partially obstructed partial ocean view room. we are mostly looking at dirty old buildings. the air conditioning in the room is super weak. does not make for a comfortable sleep. and prob similar to alot of touristy places, everything is overpriced, cant get an omelette for less than $20. self parking is $45 per day or $52 valet!! PER DAY! not to mention the outrageous ""resort fee"" -- what does this get us anyway??","July 18, 2019"
"Right off the start we were impressed with the hospitality of the staff of the hotel. Rita at the front desk checked us in and she went above and beyond. She was a joy to work with and is an asset to the hotel. Our room was nice and the view was amazing. Mountains to one side and the beach to the other. We ate at two of the restaurants, Tropics and The Rainbow Lanai. Tropics was good. The Rainbow Lanai breakfast buffet was pricy but it was wonderful and again we were impressed by the hospitality of the staff. Our server, Isabel, again went above and beyond what we expected! We also were able to spend some time speaking with her manager, Kathy, who suggested some local markets to visit. Both of these team members were amazing. During our entire stay we never encounter a team member who was rude. The down side of this hotel was the crowds. It was impossible to enjoy the pool. The beach was better.","July 18, 2019"
This is a lovely property right on Waikiki. The rooms are darling. The only thing missing was a microwave oven. The check in process also needs to be improved as you’re shuffled around from one line to another and then must wait again for the room to be ready. ,"July 18, 2019"
"We traveled from california to visit Oahu with the family and found the hilton to be very accommodating.. I am a silver honors member and was not anticipating anything other than common courtesy and an enjoyable vacation with the children.. the ambience is lively and somewhat hectic.. however the pools were lovely, the beach very clean and a great lagoon with rentals... our room had 3 double beds and a queen sofa sleeper... older, but nice and clean in the Tapa tower..The food was resort priced, no more or less than any other vacation resort that I have stayed in..I am an airline employee and have been to many destinations and feel that the hilton hawaiian suited the family’s needs...Please do something about the pool towel check in and out!!!! very very silly and confusing especially when the pool towel return stands close before the pools!!! mahalo for a fun vacation","July 17, 2019"
"Very crowded and way overpriced on what you ge, he you still have to pay for $50 resort fee and $45 per day parking ... it's like a zoo... kids and people everywhere. Not the place you can relax in. I would never stay here again and I'm a diamond member. $40 for breakfast buffet lol","July 17, 2019"
"If you're looking for a relaxing quiet hotel this is probably not the place for you. Housekeepers are very loud, very early in the morning. The beds are also very uncomfortable. We booked a beach view room and upon checking upgraded $55 extra a night to a suite in the Rainbow Tower. However it was NOT a suite and was a small basic room facing the Lagoon instead of the beach. If we weren't so tired we would've complained and changed. The walls are very thin and the people next door to us played very loud music. Expensive trip and not as a great as it could have been. The pools are beautiful and the distance to the beach walking is great. ","July 17, 2019"
"bit crowded with too many people but not bad.. on the beach, lot of things to do... staff should be bit more nicer... they are bit sarcastic all the time... i will not go there again as there is so much more to explore","July 17, 2019"
"Our family of 4 enjoyed this resort for 5 nights. I loved having the beach access right there. My son and I signed up to take surfing lessons at the beach side kiosk and the lessons were conveniently located at the beach in front of the hotel. The instructors were amazing and we had an incredible experience! I would do it again in a heartbeat! Our room was clean and nice. The patio needed some cleaning due to the birds who like to perch and poo. But we could see the beach and pools from our room. The pools were nice, but we didn't really use them because of how many kids were swimming there and the beach was better. We loved the convenience of the stores and shops located on the resort. Valet parking was great too! Customer service was excellent all around. I would stay here again!","July 16, 2019"
"The kokua we received right from check in was great. The line was super long but staff came right to us and pre checked us in while we were in the line. We didn't even have to wait THAT long. Valet was great the entire time. We understand the craziness and the traffic in/outgoing so it wasn't a problem waiting a couple minutes everytime we needed the car. Having little shops here and there, dairy queen, starbucks, lots of restaurants catering to different ethnicities was awesome!!. Catching a glimpse of the tahitian dancing was great!. The last bang of the drum set off the firework show on Friday. We hugged really tight while watching the firework show. our family had an amazing stay for a few days. My baby cried her eyes out on check out day. lol. had to negotiate a date of return with her to keep her quiet. lol. Be back soon Hilton!. Mahalo for the wonderful stay!. Being the only Hawaiian/Samoan Ohana there I must say was different. But it was worth it!. Mahalo! We'll be a hop skip and jump away on the Big Island.-Aloha!","July 16, 2019"
"HHV is a huge Resort that is nestled within Waikiki…but it seems very secluded. It’s really a place that is self-sufficient and if you wanted to, you could stay the whole time and never leave the resort. We did leave and walk to dinner one night in Waikiki. But, most of the time we stayed within the resort. There are plenty of shops, restaurants, pool, and beach options available if you did not want to leave. The history of the resort is really unique. Spend some time reading over the history and famous guests - there is a timeline in the main hallway of the Tapa Tower. We are Hilton Gold members but knew ahead of time that we would not be upgraded. It was fine. Normally, we are upgraded but we were there 4th of July and understood that upgrades or late check-out would not be possible, they were at full capacity. That also meant, unfortunately, that the pool areas were really impacted. No loungers available, etc. But, we expected as much. It’s one of their busiest times, probably the only other week similar would be Christmas. They could improve the situation by monitoring towels left on loungers for multiple hours. I did not see anybody really monitoring this. Overall though, it was a nice stay. ","July 16, 2019"
"Reality is my husband put in the right dates, wrong month. Our fault. Hilton customer service assured us we would be seen right. Apparently not. The Reservations manager was not keen to cut a deal even though they had pocketed our money from a no show and we had arrived without accommodation. In fact the price offered was $200 more than what we had previously paid. Not cool, in fact it goes against how the Hilton’s customer service team portrayed themselves. Make sure you triple check because there’s no kindness with this lot. Needless to say we booked elsewhere.","July 16, 2019"
"We are fortunate enough to be Diamond members of Hilton, but this frankly means nothing at this hotel. The location is great, based between the mall and the main strip, the facilities are fine, however that is the end of the good stuff. The communication prior to our trip was terrible (the hotel just doesn't respond to emails very well, if at all), the check in was a mess (we ended up having to wait till 9pm for one of our rooms), they also incorrectly billed me too much twice and then even charged me for beach towels (even though we had left the cards in the room at the instruction of the front desk). All of the billing errors were sorted out, however it was a mess. The staff at the front desk are all good, but the management should be ashamed of the service. I can only think that the hotel is so full/profitable that they simply don't care about their customers.","July 15, 2019"
We decided to book 5 rooms for a family reunion and our stay was okay the hotel has a lot of wear on it and the hotel is very busy so the service is slow. The location is great but just be prepared for the service. As a diamond member they said they dont offer 4pm check out unless you pay $175 doesn’t matter about availability 3 front desk agents told me this which is ridiculous and Hilton shouldn’t allow this policy. They only offer $20 of breakfast but with the prices of food that is not even 1/2 a meal. This is not the kind of benefits a Hilton Honor member expects so I would find another hilton hotel. ,"July 15, 2019"
"Location, room, & housekeeper was excellent! Check-in desk staff & text responses from Hilton reps that they initiate to guests need a LOT of work!! For business travelers their check-out invoice is confusing...4 separate taxes PER DAY with no distinction btwn any. Translation, claim for reimbusement will immediately be rejected by corporate travel auditors until details ie. differences are provided. Easily cleared up by a call but can be avoided altogether if they'd just detail the itemization appropriately, ie. city tax, resort tax etc.","July 15, 2019"
"LOCATION: This massive hotel - it is eight separate towers - is located in the heart of Waikiki along the beach. GETTING THERE: The hotel is about 20 miles from Daniel Inouye International Airport, and driving directions can be found on the hotel website. Although my wife and I did not drive to the Hawaiian Village, parking is $43/day or $50/day for valet service.There are two companies that have contracts with the hotel to provide shuttle service: Speedi Shuttle and Charley’s Taxi. I would recommend using Charley’s Taxi. My wife and I took Speedi Shuttle to the hotel. Our plane had arrived late, and while we had a nice greeting from the person who met us (including giving us each a lei), the fact that this is a shared service meant we had to wait for 10 minutes for another couple to arrive. (They never showed.) Charley’s Taxi, which we took back to the airport, is not shared. Furthermore, there was a price difference, albeit a small one: $32 flat rate for Speedi Shuttle for my wife and me; $29 flat rate for Charley’s Taxi. STAFF: To stay the staff here is amazing would be an understatement. Everyone was incredibly helpful. I cannot say enough about Lorry, Jackie, and Rowel, who assisted us with our rooms and our checkout. The concierge in the Ail’l building gave us all kinds of information about the area. How housekeeping is able to keep the buildings spotless with so many people tracking water or sand around is a testament to their hard work. I think it also important to recognize the groundskeeping staff, who maintain acres of beautiful plants and water features. ROOMS: The rooms are what one would expect from a Hilton resort, meaning they are wonderful. On our first night, my wife and I stayed in the Tapa building. Our room had two double beds, flat-screen TV, desk, large shower, and a mini-fridge. We also got a partial view of the beach. Because of our status with Hilton Honors, we were moved for our second and third nights to the Ail’l building, which appears to be newer. The room was more modern looking than that in the Tapa building, and we had a full view of the beach.  FACILITIES: Where to begin? This hotel has several pools and at least two fitness centers, one of which is open 24 hours. (The Ail’l building has its own pool and fitness room.) The beach is next to the hotel. There are daily classes that include yoga, aerobics, and ukelele lessons, among other activities; twice a week there are movie nights, and every Friday there is a fireworks show. Additionally, the hotel offers (for a fee) a luau five days a week, or one can take (again, for a fee) a ride on a submarine. (For activities, see the schedule that is available in your room, or get a copy from the concierge.) The village offers about 90 restaurants, eateries, and shops. Simply put, there is a lot to do. INTERNET ACCESS: Internet in the rooms is free. THE AREA: Waikiki offers numerous places to shop and eat. The Hilton Village is within walking distance of Kalakaua Avenue, where one can find a large array of high-end shops and all kinds of restaurants. Also within walking distance is the Honolulu Zoo. NOTE: The hotel charges a $40 resort fee each night, which covers such amenities as internet, the movie nights, and the daily classes. This was my first time visiting Hawaii and my wife's second. We were unable to stay longer because of my work, but suffice it to say that we intend to return to Hawaii, and to stay once again at the Hilton Hawaiian Village.","July 15, 2019"
"We loved almost everything about our stay. Unlike some reviews posted, our check-in was almost seamless. Oh the person working could have been a bit more friendly, but she was efficient and took care of our needs. She gave us a map of the large property and explained how best to reach our room in the Diamond Head Tower. I might mention here that there were multiple elevators for this tower and our wait times throughout our three day pre-cruise stay were never lengthy. Our room was spacious, clean, and we had a great view of the resort and beach from our balcony; we watched the 4th of July fireworks from it! We were happy with all of our dining choices in the resort. We ate at four different spots. We found all of the shops/stores to be well-stocked and to have friendly employees. The beach is clean and towels readily available. The view of famed Diamond Head is unbeatable as one enjoys a nice swim. The lagoon is unique and attractive. We booked 2 tours working with Amy Wu at the Tours/Activities desk. She was great! We were pleased with her friendly demeanor, knowledge, and efficiency. IF we ever return to Hawaii we will probably stay here again.","July 15, 2019"
"Too Big, too loud, too American.Took four hours to get our group in their rooms with their luggage. Staff unfriendly and unhelpful. Service poor - but they still had their hand out for a tip.The rooms were OK, but for the price it was a sad way to end a wonderful family holiday on Oahu. Definitely not again","July 14, 2019"
"From the hotel location, to the many options right at the hotel was enough to make you feel like you were in heaven. I had the pleasure to do the Catamaran tour right off the hotel beach and it was incredible. The view was spectacular and the crew was unbelievable. I highly recommend this excursion!","July 14, 2019"
"I'm actually writing this review while I'm at the resort. I have been here 1 day and it has been horrible! Check in was ridiculous! It took 2 hours. The resort fees are outrageous! They advertise all the benefits you get but the only thing actually included is the same thing you get at every hotel for free. ALL the activities and amenities have extra fees to participate. Also, this hotel and surrounding area is not very well cared for. The only plus is that the staff here has been pretty friendly and the food has been good. I don't reccomend this hotel, so far it's been a total rip off.","July 13, 2019"
"We loved everything from the moment we arrived. The scenery was breathtaking, and our rooms view was to die for! All a dream come true! The luau was incredible and loved every moment and even the fact got to be part of the show!! My husband and I loved it so much we can’t wait to go back!","July 13, 2019"
"Trying to find a chair at the pool is hell. Start having individuals being on the lookout for people who just put their towels on a chair and just leave. I noticed this on multiple occasions and it just continues to happen. Prices at the beach are absurd. $18 to rent a chair and $34 to rent an umbrella. Talk about taking advantage of your guests. And if it’s an outside company, get rid of them and hire someone else. ","July 13, 2019"
"The Rainbow tower rooms have a great view and the beach is perfect outside of the hotel. Plenty of amenities in the area, but can be a little crowded. I think that all of Waikiki is crowded though in the summer.","July 13, 2019"
"The property is very beautiful but the rooms need updating. The bed was hard, super small fridge, no microwave, and small bathroom. Paid for ocean side $400.00 a night and should have been called super pool side. Got a run around wanting a better room. Will spend my money elsewhere next time. ","July 11, 2019"
"Hilton Waikiki Village is a very big resort, and very crowded as well. We stayed in Ali’s tower, the only building with its own reception counter. If you stay in other towers, there will be long line in front of the counter waiting for you.Not too bad for families with kids. However, for those who are seeking for relaxing and luxurious vacation experience, just skip it.The Bali steakhouse is pretty good, though some waitresses in Tropics restaurant are awful. One even tried to cheat us on the bills.","July 11, 2019"
"The main reason we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was to avoid the traffic and enjoy the fireworks show. The check-in process was smooth and the receptionist was very helpful in explaining everything that was available over the long weekend.We also dined at Fresco Italian Restaurant with 2 other guests. However, the reservation was made for the following day but the maitre d was very understanding and helpful. Best of all our server was cheerful and vibrant, which made our dinner that much more enjoyable..","July 10, 2019"
"Not sure why entices me about this property, but I've stayed here on two of my three trips to Honolulu. I'll be staying again on my next visit. My most recent trip had me in a corner room in the Rainbow Tower. Doesnt' get much better! View of the beach and Hilton Head, plus the fireworks on Friday night. My room was huge and very clean. I had plenty of closet space. I'll agree with the comments about the crowds. My flight arrived late in the evening and the lobby was deserted. But the following morning was a little chaotic. I love all the shopping options available. There are two ABC stores on the property. I had the chance to do some last minute shopping while not leaving the property. They have some wonderful entertainment onsite. The beach and the lagoon are both spectacular. Breakfast is really good also with fresh made eggs and omelets without much of a wait. I have no complaints from my recent visit. It's Hawaii - I expect the crowds. They have a video box near the elevators and you are allowed to have one movie checked out. This would be great in the event of a rainy day. They also had a desk where you could create your own flip flops. Wish I'd had time for that....next time!","July 10, 2019"
Just wrapped up a two night stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Oahu.This is our fifth time at this resort and marks a family tradition that whenever we come to Hawaii we stay here for a few nights before we head back to the mainland.Although the resort is very large and crowded if you stay in the Alli tower like we do you feel like you are in an oasis in this giant resort.As crowded as this resort is the staff is super friendly service is very good in all the bars and restaurants and the views are amazing of diamond head and Waikiki.I will continue to come to this resort and continue the family resort tradition in years to come.Aloha and Mahlo Hilton Hawaiian Village,"July 9, 2019"
"Pros - Large hotel complex, with tons of shopping opportunities, several top-notch pools, a large lagoon (paddleboards, kayaks, pedal boats all for rent), several restaurants, and great ocean views. Easy access to Atlantis submarine trips and dinner cruise ship. Shuttles available either on -site or adjacent to the complex. We made use of the on-site availability of the Atlantis tours folks, and really enjoyed the salt-water lagoon. Cons - This place sees tons of people checking in and checking out daily. The large, open-air main lobby is staffed by incredibly nice/helpful folks, but they simply cannot handle the volume well. We had two stays in this hotel (in the Rainbow Tower - very nice!) on our trip (one 4 day stay and one 6 day stay), and both took forever for us to get checked in. The first check-in took nearly 40 minutes; the second took about 20 minutes to check-in, but since we were there in the morning (about 11 am) we had leave our luggage with the Bell Hop and come back when the room was actually available, which was about 2 hours later.Even the elevators couldn't quite handle the crowds, as we often had to wait for significant amounts of time to get an elevator in the Rainbow Tower.Rooms were nice, clean, and well-appointed. If you don't like coconut, though - I detest it - bring your own shampoo. Rooms have a free safe and a small refrigerator, but no microwave, which was inconvenient.My biggest complaint in regards to the rooms had to do with the pillows. Simply put, the pillows are thin and not nearly as comfortable as the pillows found at Marriotts and Drury Inns. I travel a lot, and found this to be very disappointing.","July 9, 2019"
"Our vacation was cut short due to a delayed flight and so we only had two full days to take in the massive amenities of the hotel. The hotelGrounds are beautiful and they do offer a lot of variety. There’s shopping which we didn’t have time to do, but they all looked appealing. The rooms were subpar in comparison to the grounds and other neighboring Hilton hotels on the island. Also, I honestly thought for as enormous as this hotel is, that the pool would be bigger. We were squished like sardines around the pool and make sure you get a spot by 8 am. Depending on the season that you go,You may not get a spot! Would I come back? Maybe. . . I wasn’t blown away and I could try something else. Loved the beach access too!","July 8, 2019"
"We have arrived at the hotel on the 7th of July 2019 and planned stay is for 5 nights. We were so excited for this trip because it is our honeymoon and Hawaii was our final destination. For this reason we choose the Hilton hotel since it is considered one of the “best” hotels in the world. We booked an ocean view room. The hotel gave as a room in the Tapa tower on the 17th floor. As soon as we walked out of the elevator on the 17th floor the carpet and the whole corridor were dirty (see pictures below). The carpet at the room entrance was dirty as well, and the room in general. Behind the tv stand shopping bags, paper, straws and in general litters were left there from previous tenants. The whole room needs to be renovated, the furniture are old, the bathroom sink had rust, the curtain in the bathroom had a bad smell and in general not what Hilton hotels should offer for the price they charge you for. The ocean view was limited, see pictures below, and the balcony table was dirty as well. We spoke with the hotels manager about the above issues and the response we got was to “clean better the room” and get one days worth breakfast. We refused. To conclude, the Hilton resort such as swimming pools, gardens etc are nice however, the rooms must be renovated, cleaned better and the management must have a better control of the rooms conditions and whether cleaning services are offered equal to a Resort such as this one.","July 8, 2019"
We stayed her three other times and had a great experience. This time not so much. We were in Tapa tower which we stayed in many years ago and the furnishings are still the same. They do not put a top sheet on the beds and I had to ask 3 times to get one. Our safe did not work. Our patio had bird poop on it and was not clean when we arrived or during our 3 night stay. We booked a room for 4 people and did. It have enough towels or coffee cups or coffee. Had to ask for more. Had to pay a resort fee each day which we knew but thought beach chairs would be included. They charged $70 for 2 chairs and an umbrella. Had to wait in line for 45 minutes to get a chair. Also had to wait until 9 am for towels for the beach in lines again. At Tapa bar wanted to order a pizza they said it would be 45 minutes if we ordered there or we could go order to go from Tropics restaurant. Stood in line there and was told they don’t have the same kind of pizza as Tapa bar. They tried to correct most of the problems but wanted a 10 rating. If I have to ask for things I don’t give a 10 rating especially when I have to ask more than once. It does have a lot of amenities but it is such a large property with so many people. The restaurants are all so expensive. This was not up to par with other Hilton resorts. ,"July 7, 2019"
"The hotel complex had everything you need, there was no real reason to leave.Great views from the balcony. Food was good, pool was excellent.If you want a family orientated resort, I recommend this one.My only negative comment is not about the resort, but Hawaii.If you come from Australia, it has less to offer than the Gold Coast in the way of activities. The scenery is lovely though.","July 7, 2019"
Stayed 3 nights here and it was very nice I would say that the restaurants are very expensive but so is just about everything in Hawaii but would recommend this place just be prepared for meals being expensive ,"July 7, 2019"
"Our family had a wonderful week at the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort! Our room was in the Rainbow Tower. We booked through Costco, but was upgraded due to our Hilton Honors status, I guess. The rooms were comfortable with a great view! We were entertained nightly by the rooftop luau! I am giving this 4 stars due to the amazingly friendly staff and great amenities available. The restaurants , however, are a bit pricey ( as are most restaurants in Hawaii). I would have liked for part of the resort fee to go to a free rental of one of the activities on the lagoon. The ukulele lessons were nice, and included. Overall, a wonderful place to stay with kids. I would not recommend this for a quiet couples retreat! Here are a few pics from our stay...","July 7, 2019"
"Really enjoyed our 'apartment' at Kalia Tower. We don't walk a lot any more, so appreciated haveing so many ammenities on the property. Loved our view of the Pacific! And enjoyed at least oe meal a day i our room. We were able to rest well, and appreciated the twice a week clean-ups. And now fast, free Wi-Fi! We hope to continue to enjoy years of ownershp here to enjoy Hawaii and its great food!","July 7, 2019"
"I just returned from my stay in Hawaii along with 32 of my friends and family. We all loved our stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The property is huge and there is a lot going on. Loved the accessibility to food, shopping, entertainment, bar, pools, and the beach. We loved our room and loved the beautiful ocean view from the 33rd floor. Highly recommend staying at this hotel. The staff and service were great!","July 6, 2019"
"I am currently a guest at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki, HI. I checked in yesterday and had a disappointing, unacceptable and terrible experience. When I arrived, I was asked if I already checked in because there was a person with the exact same first and last name and exact same itinerary as me. I jokingly replied “Oh really? I hope my room was not given to the wrong person.” Silence is golden, as they say, because there was no immediate reply to confirm this statement but after a few minutes, the woman behind the desk states “I’m afraid the property is pretty full today and it is possible we may not have your requested room available.” I inform her this is non-negotiable since I paid for an ocean view room and I expect an ocean view room. She leaves the desk for a few minutes and when she returns, miraculously there is just one ocean view room left on the entire property.After assigning this room, I was astounded to hear that the room was still dirty. The time at this point is 5:10pm. It is clearly stated online that check-in is at 3pm. She informs me the room cleaning will be rushed and should be ready within an hour, by 6:10pm, which is still over 3 hours after check-in. When expressing my surprise that the room is not ready and that I have never encountered a room that was not ready by check-in, let alone more than three hours later, I was even more shocked to hear her casually say, “oh this can happen frequently here. Sometimes rooms are not available for guests to check-in until 9pm.” This statement alone is completely insane, as I have never encountered this in all of my travels.Lastly, the room was not ready until 7pm, 4 hours after the stated check-in time, which is completely unacceptable and a huge inconvenience after a long day of travel.","July 6, 2019"
"We stayed at the Tapa Tower in a Junior Suite and we loved it. So much space, quiet and privacy. Plus we had the most incredible views of the Friday fireworks!!For a family of 4 having a dining table was a big plus as we could grab food from the ABC shop (which has a great selection) and we felt like we had our own private corner tucked away from the busy crowds. Yes the room was dated and desperately needs a refurb but with young kids this wasn’t a big deal for us. We booked on a half off suite sale so value was good but not sure if it’s worth the full price in its current state.Resort was busy but we didn’t find it too bad except the Friday and Saturday night. The Tapa pool was our favourite as heated and close to our room. I loved the shops and having everything you needed on site. It really is a village. Just walking around was nice and the kids loved the grounds.Food onsite is not cheap but convenient and compared to centre of Waikiki we found it easier to get tables as it’s busy everywhere due to the June / July holidays. Starbucks was the only thing eye watering expensive.","July 4, 2019"
Terrible room for the cost. Check in staff is not friendly and if you are a Hilton member specially diamond don’t expect any special treatment. Horrible hotel. Would not stay here ever again. I would give a zero if I could. ,"July 4, 2019"
My family and I loved this place... We stayed in the rainbow tower with an ocean front room and the diamond head tower as well...I enjoyed the view from our rainbow tower room we were on the 9th floor excellent view... let me start from the beginning we used speedi shuttle we arrived at the resort checkin was about 20 mins be advise u pay both resort fees and incidental upfront.. Our first morning we we to the breakfast buffet very expensive but I think worth it...We mostly at off the resort the pizza shop across the street was really good ice cream shop as well.. We tried the food truck by the lagoon as well very good.. I can’t wait to go back without the kiddos this time ,"July 4, 2019"
"View from the rainbow tower, was delightful. Elevator system slow. Room was so so. Needs some TLC from normal day to day people. Could never get near pool, tons of towels no people. Tried several times. Umbrella/chair people for the beach very nice and polite.","July 3, 2019"
"We’ve stayed here a few times and have always had a great experience. Great workout/fitness floor, as well as multiple pools and onsite restaurants, shops, convenience stores too. It’s a mini city in itself. Parking garage onsite. Very professional and friendly staff.","July 3, 2019"
"Beautiful resort with some much to see and do. The grounds are beautiful. There are several restaurants on property with something for everyone. From fine dining steak house and seafood, a Japanese steakhouse, Italian cuisine, pizza, deli, ice cream shop, shrimp truck and everything in between. Several bars with live entertainment and a great roof top Luau.The rooms are lovely and the service is outstanding. They have fireworks over the lagoon every Friday night.","July 3, 2019"
Family holiday with mum dad 2 teenagers a 2 year old and nanna ! Perfect setting for all age groups lots to do for parents and kids. The only down side was the overinflated prices at all resort venues. Leave the resort to eat and shop at supermarkets nearby. The is also a very handy laundrette 5 min walk away.,"July 2, 2019"
"Not a fan of this hotel. Made our reservations a year in advance and specified wanting a king size bed. Instead got 2 doubles. Apparently, the hotel only has kings and doubles, and we drew the short straw. The management was going to move our room, but we had exploring plans and did not want to wait for the move to happen.Fireworks were nice, but expect a huge level of commercialism. Nothing like what I expected in Hawaii.","July 2, 2019"
"At the north end of Waikiki, a great location. This is a comprehensive resort with maybe five large towers. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment in the Lagoon tower. It was spacious and the beds were comfortable. There was one bedroom with a king bed, another with two twins, and a pull out couch that would fit a couple snuggly, or one teenager comfortably. The apartment had a full kitchen with microwave, stove, oven, dishwasher, and fridge. This was good for the kids who don’t really like eating breakfast out, and often had leftovers. There was a washing machine and dryer on our floor, and soap included in the room. There were two full bathrooms, one with a Japanese washlet. The room had two balconies, one with a table large enough for four to dine on. Our balcony faced the lagoon, which was good for watching the fireworks on Friday night. The room has three TVs and a PS3. It did the job very well for our family vacation. It could use a remodel in some respects. The resort has five pools. The two we used were the super pool and the paradise pool, which had a water slide. The water slides are not super big, the kids had fun. There is also a large lagoon that’s great for small kids. They rent kayaks and trikes. And there is a pretty good beach right near the hotel. There is an ABC store that sells floats for cheap right on site. They also have a good selection of food and souvenirs. There is a larger ABC super store across the street. The restaurants the resort are pretty pricey. I think the best bets are take out at Round Table pizza, or the Blue Water seafood place. There is also lots of shopping. The Hawaii cookie shop was a nice choice for souvenirs, as was the ABC for inexpensive gifts. Save your receipts for bonus gifts. Our room ended up costing about $500 a night with tax and resort fees. Service was pretty good. One annoyance was that the concierge seemed to mainly be there to sell Hilton Vacations. This is a massive complex with thousands of rooms. It does get crowded. I think it is good option for families with children. ","July 2, 2019"
"Our family of 4 thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this resort. It absolutely was a destination resort, you wouldn't need to leave the property if you didn't want to.We stayed for 5 nights in the Ali Towers and the room was very nice. We enjoyed the hotel restaurant for breakfast brunch one morning and both the servers and the food were top notch. The parrots in the lobby area were delightful and the lighting of the tiki torches each night by one of the entertainers from the Luau was a highlight as well. Be sure not to miss the small coffee shop/ice cream shop in the building that houses the Ali. We had great sandwiches and cookies there several nights. All in all, a good place to stay for 1st timers to the island.","July 2, 2019"
"My husband and I spent 7 days here for our anniversary and we can’t wait to go back. Everything was so amazing, location, beach, shopping, and food. There are so many tho ha to choose from all on there property. Plus you can grab the bus right outside and be in Waikiki beach in just minutes. Also close to the mall.","July 2, 2019"
The online pictures don't do the actual beautiful justice. This is a beautiful and amazing place. Enjoyed everything about it. You won't be disappointed if you pick this place. Clean and perfect location. Everything you need is at this property. Will go back again!!!,"July 2, 2019"
"I travel 40-50 nights per year and this hotel is one of the worst managed I’ve stayed in. I asked for upgrades based on my platinum AMEX and Hilton Honors at check in and the clerk told me was too busy to check. I had reserved a king and got two small double beds. The room was so beat up. Peeling and missing paint on the woodwork, walls with dents from having been hit by luggage. Scratches on all the chairs and wood tables. The linens were ancient and smelly. Not sure the Days Inn organization would approve a franchise application for this place. There were no chairs in the elevator lobby. Worse was the service. Everyone smiled while they told the guests NO to every possible request. I had to call four times, not once, not twice, not thrice but four times just to get hangers for the closet. I had to repeatedly tell the maid we were not ready for service even though the privacy sign was out. She kept trying to come into the room in spite of the privacy sign. After five days of business meetings I finally got to the hotel lagoon for a bit of r and r and was told that the place on the sand I sat on was reserved for “Japanese” guests only. I thought racial discrimination was illegal. In all seriousness, the bratty beach kid probably meant a Japanese tour group but that’s not what he said. I mentioned the 14th amendment to him and of course got a blank stare.As I was walking back to the room to write this review I was accosted by another employee/kid who told me to stand aside so he could drive his golf cart loaded with lawn chairs past me on the sidewalk. He was driving the cart with a couple inches of me legs to get me to move. The sidewalk was crowded and he was accosting all the walkers until they moved out of the way for him. The management here is just extremely poor and doesn’t come close to Hilton’s usually decent standards. ","July 2, 2019"
"We are staying in a 1-bedroom at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Grand Islander tower. 2 adults and 2 children. The room is esthetically pleasing but not functional for a family. The room is small. Most 1-bedroom timeshare units have a dining table. This room has a breakfast bar that can accommodate 4 tightly...but forget about inviting friends over to your unit. The sofa bed has a thin mattress where you feel the springs. I know its for kids but I felt sorry they have to sleep on it for a week. There is only 1 vanity! Good luck getting toiletries for a family of 4 situated. I have never been in a timeshare unit with a single vanity. The bathtub is awkward (thin, short and deep). The balcony is thin and can not accommodate a table. The family can not have breakfast or lunch on it. The sink and the dishwasher are miniature. The fridge is also narrow (but sufficient). Closet space is likewise extremely limited. I suspect the person who designed the unit is single or has no kids. This is the newest tower. We have stayed at other towers where the rooms were larger. Newer is not always better. Additionally there are other things that were disappointing. They provide a kitchen, but no salt. Not a single towel booth or beach kiosk has a compressor for water inflatables. You have to go to the ABC store where they charge you a fee. These are little things but other places provide them as a courtesy. Hilton really needs to take the example of other resorts to provide maximum convenience to their customers.Finally, while the room has a playstation....there is no activity room for young adults or family. No pool tables, ping pong, foosball etc. I thought these things were a given, but apparently not.","July 2, 2019"
"This resort has everything from ocean beaches to swimming pools and a lagoon. There are restaurants, retail food, beverage and sundry shops. It is close to town with a huge upscale mall. Island excursion buses stop there as well as Uber and public bus stop. The rooms have great views, are clean and roomy. The innovative elevator system saves waiting times.","July 2, 2019"
"We had a great time at this resort. As the rooms most definitely need to be upgraded, overall they were not bad as we weren't in them all that long. If we asked for anything, it was quickly arranged/brought to the room. The only thing that was a small issue was our mini fridge didn't work. Loved all the available shopping and ammenities so close/on hand. We were able to get pretty much anything we needed right there on site. Starbucks closes way too early, in my opinion though. My son, who is 18 & very hard to impress....absolutely loved it and wants to go back asap! ","July 2, 2019"
This was literally or best vacation ever. Our room was gorgeous. Our two balconies were great front row seats to the beautiful Pacific ocean and the Friday night fireworks. Would stay here again and again and again! ,"July 2, 2019"
"This vacation has been a blessing for our family. We have enjoyed every single day of our stay. Be prepared to spend lots of money on the resort. If you go to the Ala Moana Center (about a mile away), you can find more reasonable pricing. This mall is also has all of your very high end stores such as PRADA, Cartier etc.","July 2, 2019"
"I stayed here with my 2 teenage kids at the end of June. While the property is expansive and vast with a LOT of shopping/dining options within walking distance and lovely pools, the room and beds were super outdated and old (circa 90's or older). We were located in the Kalia Tower (23rd floor) and had 2 double beds; my daughter and I shared a bed - the mattress had a significant sag in the middle and not sure in what decade they replaced the mattresses but they may want to consider doing so soon.","July 2, 2019"
"This may end up being a long review, but I encourage you to read it for some truly helpful information...This resort is ridiculously busy! Wall to wall people all the time. If you’re looking for a serene Hawaiian getaway, this is not the place. No Lei or traditional Hawaiian greeting upon arrival. The lobby is so crowded it’s hard to tell where to even go. This place is very impersonal. Consequently, due to the sheer volume of people, this resort is really beat up. The furnishings are dented, scratched, and badly aged. This hotel needs a refurbishment. The rooms In the Ali’i building are a decent size, but only have a king bed or double beds. No queen beds to be had. We checked into a rollaway bed for our teenage son, they want $125 per night for the rollaway. Insane!This resort is so large it has two Starbucks (just to give you an idea of truly how big this place is). The Starbucks are franchised by the hotel, so their pricing structure is severely inflated. A tall specialty tea cost me $10 on property, but when I ventured two hotels down to the Outrigger, my tea was back down to $4.25. Ridiculous! If you’re up for a walk, go to the next resort to get your coffee fix. At another quick service cafe, a large fountain soda was $5.24. The food was edible but the prices were just dumb! Please go off property to eat or you will blow your entire vacation budget on a tea and soda. The beach by this hotel seems to be larger than other resorts on Waikiki Beach, BUT it is VERY crowded! For those that don’t know, all beaches In Hawaii are public. So, if you are hoping to plop in the sand at a quiet resort beach and have someone bring you drinks while you enjoy the surf, this is NOT the place for you. This resort is located at the end of the “strip” so to speak. It is situated near a public Marina with a large parking lot allowing easy access to the general public and it is super crowded, and if you want to be comfortable on the beach, it’s gonna cost ya. You have to rent chairs and an umbrella for the beach from the hotel. A chair is $18 and an umbrella is $32. So if my family of four would like to spend the day on the beach, it’s a whopping $104 for four chairs and one umbrella. That is pure insanity! This is in addition to the $45 per day “resort fee” that gets you absolutely nothing, and if you rent a car that’s another fee. And what resort of this size doesn’t have a laundry facility?!?! Only in one building for timeshare guests!! Unbelievable really for the size and volume of guests at this place. This hotel is also not super convenient to the amazing shopping district in Waikiki. It’s a good mile walk, so strap on your comfy shoes! There could be a trolley/shuttle (not sure there was no literature in the room) or you will need to take a lyft or Uber. So, you may think you’re saving money on the up front room cost, but believe me, it adds up in the end. You could have stayed at a more upscale resort with a more convenient location, not felt nickel and dimed the whole time, and had a more relaxing time. Hilton really missed the mark with this “flagship” property. I would like to say you get what you pay for, but not here. This is far less of a value given what you’re expected to pay here. Truly disappointing and I hope this information can help others make an educated decision about staying here. ","July 1, 2019"
"We have previously stayed at other resorts in Honolulu under the Marriot umbrella. On this occasion, we decided to try the Hilton Waikiki Village.On arrival at around 2:00pm yesterday, Jackie at the Front Desk informed us a fee of USD$50 + tax was required to access the room now (check in is at 3pm). I understand if the resort has high occupancy and is still turning around the room on our arrival. However, the room was ready, and charging an early check-in fee an hour prior to the official check-in time is criminal.We’re at the Kalia Tower. The fridge is empty, which is fine for us, but it is located right near the toilet inside the bathroom. In room amenities are very limited, and there is no kettle, cutlery- only 2 coffee mugs. The towels are old and tattered.The overall service around the Hotel is poor and is well below expectations for a Hilton.The front desk representative is clearly trying to up sell the more premium tower and gave little to no information to justify the advantages of these rooms.As we are staying at this resort for the next 14 days, we would have expected a higher level of service, particularly from a Hilton property. We are now thinking of moving to another Hotel.","July 1, 2019"
"The complex in huge. There are a number of towers and the drop off of luggage and people is one spot that can be a 5-8 minute walk from the front lobby. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower (where Elvis spent a few days in the 1960's before renting a house). It is updated but small since rooms were not as large back when built in the mid 20th century. The tub is higher since it is older but there is a grab bar. The partial ocean view rooms do give a great view from either side of the tower. People are great, and beach and places to eat are close. Be sure you are prepared to walk or rent a wheelchair - weekly rates are best. The concierge desk is centrally located and there are several on duty. Very helpful about what there is to do and will even print out your boarding passes for your flight home.","July 1, 2019"

"The Hilton is the biggest and best family resort in Hawaii!!! The beach, the lagoon, the awesome slides at the pool. It's like a wet and wild except there is a real beach and real sand. The Aloha sport is alive and well at the HHV!","July 1, 2019"
"The resort is HUGE! It is not being cute calling it a village, the resort is made up of several buildings, pools, shops, restaurants. If you are looking for serene tropical elegance- this is NOT the place for you. There is live music at Tropics, Waikiki is a busy public beach, the pools are full of kids playing and splashing. If you are looking for a high energy, well located property HHV will be a good fit. You are within walking distance of LOADS of restaurants and shopping and a short bus ride (or longer walk) to a monster mall (Ala Moana Center)We stayed in a 1 bed room suite in the Ali'i Tower. The Ali'i was worth the extra money just to skip the HUGE check in line for the other towers. It was really well located and well appointed. It also smelled FABULOUS. Keurigs were in the rooms and their special blend of coffee was AWESOME. We bought half and half at the ABC store and kept it in the room fridge so never bothered with Starbucks, since the lines were crazy long. The room itself was very nice: 1 King bed with large bathroom (shower/bath combo) and a living room with a double sofa bed and another bathroom (shower only). The sofa bed was too small for my 14 yo son and 11 yo daughter to share. HHV wanted $125 a NIGHT for a rollaway cot! BWAH HA HA. NO. We went to the Target at the Ala Moana Center and spent $30 on an inflatable twin bed with pump. The pools are nice, my kids liked the Paradise pool with the slides. The Lagoon is a nice spot for salt water swimming out of the current and playing in the sand. We rented a paddle board from Quality Surfboards for the day instead of from the pro shop on the lagoon for the hour (same price). If you are on a tight budget Hawaii might stress you out- it is expensive. 4 adult meals at a casual resturant in the midwest would be about $50 with sodas, tip, and tax in Waikiki it would be $100. Somewhere really nice with cocktails/ wine and you can easily hit $300. The HHV resturants are on the high end for Waikiki since you are paying for NOT having to go far. There are loads of less extortionate choices if you walk a bit.The pictures are pretty accurate. The buildings and pools are lovely, the water really is that color. The sand isn't supersoft and won't make a sandcastle, but the beach was clean. We have NO regrets about staying at the HHV. The upgrade to the Ali'i was worth it just to skip the lines, and the private pool and bar was very nice.","July 1, 2019"
"When you stay here at the Ali Tower,on an annual basis you don’t expect to be put into the worst room in the place. This is the first time on arrival that we have had this experience and boy was it a let down. The staff at the Ali tower check in were totally unhelpful nor did they care. We had to take action and sought out the manager. To his credit he got us into a great room the following day and we are very appreciative to him. This made our stay enjoyable.","June 30, 2019"
"Checked in a few days ago and I am thoroughly disguted and diaappointed. This may as well be a Motel 6 in Nebraska. The tiny bathroom, dingy room, beat up furniture and musty smell make me want to hop on a plane back home immediately. Nothing is really convenient. The beach is a long walk away. Absolutely no luxury here. It all takes too much work to do anything. No room service. The mini frig is empty. No robes in the room. Not even a flat sheet on the bed - gross! The ""view"" is of a roof of a building which is spotted with green slime and bird poop. And even though my Hilton Honors profile says quiet upper floor room, I am on a low floor near a pool with screaming children and a bus drop off/pick up spot. In fact, most all of the pools are filled with children and the only adult pool is on the 4th floor of another building a 10 min walk away and it's smaller than most backyard pools. The daily resort fee of $45 does not even include a chair at the beach - that's $18 and I didn't even bother to inquire about the umbrella fee. The beach is not appealing - kinda grimy, crowded and loud and didnt appear to have any services in the way of food or drinks. What that fee does include is the rental of DVDs and cartridges for a PlayStation though! Yes, I did ask to be moved to another room, even if I had to pay more money and was told they were sold out completely. Not a property for solo guests or anyone who desires some peace and quiet. I thought I would get a few days to relax before having to work, but alas...this place has no chill. It's huge, impersonal and loud. Gold status means nothing except a few coupons here and there. They won't even put water in your room. You have to get it from the concierge (and that would be 2 bottles per STAY!)I have stayed at properties all over the world and so much of this is incomprehensible in terms of the amount being charged vs what you receive. Definitely would not recommend or pay my own money to return.","June 29, 2019"
"Stayed 4 nights at the Hilton in the kappa tower. The room was simple and clean. Air con and tv worked perfectly. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. $45 resort fee is ridiculous, don’t get much for it and annoying that it’s not upfront and included in the initial cost.","June 29, 2019"
"If you’re looking for a “never have to leave the resort for any reason” type of place, this is it. Stores galore (including ABC), coffee shops, ice cream shops, jewelry, clothes, restaurants, etc. It is a VERY large resort. Should only take a day to get your bearings though. With the beach, its own lagoon and plenty of pools, you really don’t need to go anywhere else. Unless you feel the need to sightsee. On the other hand, about 10k other people seem to know that as well (& they were all here!). So, if you are looking for a quiet, peaceful, restful vacation, this is not the place. People and events are everywhere! That said, the resort also has a very professional and organized staff that seemed very adept at managing the crowds. Check-in was quick and efficient as was checking out. Only had a short wait at a few of the restaurants for breakfast and lunch. Visit the concierge for your free daily bottles of water and the first time you get a pamphlet good for many discounts around the resort. However, understand their primary objective (every time you stop by the desk) seems to be to get you to visit the Grand Vacations Club Sales Center. They normally have a great “perk” that you get for listening to the pitch, so if you’ve got a few ours to kill, go for it. Just be strong. We got tickets to a show in Las Vegas for listening to the offer there a few years ago. We turned down the $150 credit this time. Two hours of my vacation time is worth more than that and there was no way we were buying into the timeshare. I’m good with being a “plain old Hilton Honors member”.The breakfast buffet (Rainbow Lanai) was very basic and expensive for what you get. Recommend breakfast at one of the many restaurants nearby. If you are not in a hurry for lunch, have a seat and relax at the Tapa Bar. It was definitely understaffed at lunch (although the waitress was very nice and was doing her very best to get to everyone). Food is from other locations so be prepared to wait a bit. There is a nice arrival/departure lounge for those early arrivals waiting for their room (if you don’t want to get the lay of the land immediately) or, having checked out, waiting for a late flight (although you are welcome to use the lounge at any time during your stay). It has a large, restful (read, quiet) seating area, small lockers and restrooms with showers (and all necessary amenities). Lastly, if you do any shopping at the numerous boutique stores (not ABC), don’t pay full price! If you balk at the price tag many will suddenly have an unadvertised 50% off sale. Try it. ","June 28, 2019"
"Stayed in the Rainbow Tower Ocean Front for 4 nights - Great location - beach is absolutely wonderful. The rooms, however are badly in need of renovation. Had the location not been great, I would have seriously downgraded this review. The wall literally had holes in it...the furniture was all badly scraped with missing chunks of wood, the room overall was dirty like it hadn't been dusted in years...the mirror was missing chunks of wood frame and it was in horrible condition. Since this is a family hotel, it would also be nice if the beds were upgraded to queen beds - 2 doubles make for a very tight fit for a visiting family. We also found the price of chair and umbrella rentals to be ridiculously high - why not make them less expensive or even complimentary to Hilton Honors members? I'm hopeful that this hotel will make some upgrades as we do like the location - it's just in horrible disrepair.","June 28, 2019"
Everything is wonderful about the facility but overcharges are flagrant.Stayed at the hotel for a funeral event with no time for pool and recreation andwe cannot even swim. We wereCharged for pool and beach towel in the amount $20 twice on my credit cardupon return home. I made sure all keys and towel cards and dvd rental cardwere returned to the agent upon check out. Wasted close to an hour callingfront desk and finance department each twice to get it fixed. Come on Hilton.get out of the dinosaur accounting system for beach towels. That was a joke.,"June 28, 2019"
"Our flight was delayed so we called the hotel ahead of time to let them know we are getting in later than expected. They said it was fine. When we arrived at 3 am with my family (2 kids) after a long travel day they explain that they overbooked the hotel. I then said that I can not believe they do not have one room left and that we called (which was noted on our account). They magically found an apartment (Diamond Head) with one King bed. We have to request roll always and make our way with lots of luggage to a very remote part of the village. When we arrive the elevator light will not even activate for the floor we need. Once in the apartment we are greeted by roaches, stained carpets, a fowl musk odor, old furniture torn and stained and curtains with mildew on them. We go back to the front desk and refuse to stay here for obvious reasons. It’s now 4:30 am back st the front desk with no manager in site to help us. They are waiving breakfast coupons and an alternative hotel option. As a Hilton Honors member I’m appalled. Such poor management and customer service. Now they are shuffling us off to some no name hotel and paying for our taxi. Do not arrive late or you and your family will be left stranded","June 28, 2019"
"There were some hiccups with our room but Hilton Hawaiian team members make sure my stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was a remarkable one. One of their manager Elias is truly a great asset to the resort. He acted swiftly while always making sure we were comfortable with any kind of changes; making sure we have everything we needed. Elias who was patient, claim and friendly. and we were able to come up with a solution we both agreed on. Elias made sure that I was happy throughout my stay. He was just an absolute joy to work with. This trip was an early 60th Birthday celebration for me and I wanted to visit the Hilton Hawaiian to watch the Friday firework show. We have stayed at the resort many times but was never able to see the fireworks. Elias, without knowing it, made sure my early Birthday celebration stay was GREAT! The view from our room's balcony of the firework show was AWESOME","June 27, 2019"
"Recently had a holiday with the family and friends to Hawaii we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for 8 nights this hotel was amazing it is located in Waikiki right on the beach the hotel has 5 different towers to stay in we stayed in The Ali'i, their is over 6 pools and a water slide on site and easy access to the beach it has many restaurants and shops on-site making this place like it's own suburb they have great friendly staff and security personnel making it a safe place to stay the only downside would be that it can be expensive especially eating in house people on a budget may want to eat elsewhere and a $40us a day tax, if looking to stay here gets extremely busy in July best time is around October or late January great place to stay has all the facilities you need highly recommend","June 27, 2019"
"As a Hilton Honors member, I look for Hilton properties when we travel. The Hilton Hawaiian Village did not disappoint! As a Diamond member, I was upgraded to a room on a higher floor with a beautiful oceanfront view. The service I received was excellent. Any question or concern that I had was handled graciously by the staff. I witnessed guests who were badgering the staff with one complaint or another, and the staff always remained professional. This is a busy hotel with many guests, and remembering that when making requests of the staff goes a long way!","June 26, 2019"
"I made a reservation to stay here in early June as I wanted to be closer to Waikiki and the Royal Hawaiian. I am a Hilton Honors member and made a reservation through the website. I do not remember the tower we were in but we were in room 3148. The bathroom granite countertop was pulling away from the wall, the decorative piece in front of the vanity was falling off and crooked and the corners were mildewed (Yes, I know its Hawaii). I was disappointed in that it was our last night in Hawaii. I took photos and texted them to the toll free number; they were acknowledged. When I commented on this to the person at he desk, she told me this room is scheduled for renovation soon. Hint: Go to the Royal Hawaiian for drinks; its about a half mile walk and the drinks are classic and cost the same.","June 26, 2019"
"Monday 6/17 - 6/22 Checkin was a breeze. Stayed in the Tapa Tower 2657. Full ocean view. The room over looked the Tapa pool and the Barefoot Bar at the Hale Koa Hotel next door. The room was clean, had a small pantry/wet bar area outside the bathroom, and a large closet with a safe. ABC store located just around the corner from the elevator bank to Tapa tower. During our stay we went on the Atlantis Sub. You can book this next to the towel stand at the super pool (which is the pool closest to the beach). We also book a Friday Sunset Fireworks cruise with Port Waikiki cruises which departs from the Hilton pier. Loved our stay at the Hilton Village.","June 26, 2019"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki. The beach front is amazing, staff was very helpful and friendly. Anything we asked, we received. It is a very busy property, but once you are on site, the benefits of the location outway the busy environment. There were plenty of pools for all guests, the village environment was beneficial (shopping, general store, restaurants) with most all of our needs right on site. If we wanted to venture out of the village, other shopping and restaurants were nearby and in walking distance!","June 26, 2019"
"A very busy resort however our stay was a perfect 5 stars from the moment we checked in until the day we left. Checking in and out was very quick and simple. Maintenance and bell hop service was amazing. Texting option was superb due to the quick responses. The resort was very clean, with fast elevators and many choices for eating and shopping. I just wished most restaurants would stay open past 10pm. ","June 26, 2019"
Check in for Hilton Honors smooth and simple. We were able to get into our room early so that was a bonus. Other than not 100% clean the room was perfect. But it was comfy and pillows super fluffy. We didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room but it was nice. The Kalia Tower have the adult-only pool so if we wanted quiet time we could get it. The grounds are beautiful and well kept with a variety of stores and restaurants throughout. The location is ideal with everything in a 10 to 15 minute walk. ,"June 25, 2019"
"My stay at a hotel is based on location , service provided , sleep quality , and value for money .  hotel is located in a wonderful front line position . waking and walking in 2 minutes swimming in the warm waters of the Pacific is fantastic . The hotel is swarming with staff . You will never want for anything ! I had the worst sleep quality in any hotel experience in my whole life . The mattress was saggy , like falling into quick sand ,the pillows were like wafers , non supportive and impossible to get a great sleep . The air con noisy and intrusive . The hot water pressure in the shower was slow and the warm water at best . Why these hotel chains insist on having the shower over the bath with a 1960,s shower curtain is beyond me . Rip it out and install proper shower stalls that you walk into - and have the shower nozzle at adjustable heights - its not rocket science . The other issue at the hotel is NOISE - its unrelenting . Oh did I mention the pidgeon birds on the balcony? They are there non stop , crapping on the balcony , the outdoor furniture , and the railings . We left the balcony door open several times as a respite from the air con and they want to wander in .... On the first day of the vacation we chatted to guy at the tourist desk who offered us a tour of the new tower of the hotel - we thought to sign us up to the hilton membership program and in return for the hour half tour you receive $ 150 in hotel vouchers to use spend how ever you wish . A few days later we fronted up and were offered seats in a conference room with 20 others to be shown video on hilton time share and a speech from a highly motivated speaker and convert to the scheme . We were then given our own salesman who led us to a room and shown lots graphs and stats why time share is right for us . This was even before I had my coffee! The whole high pressure sales routine was 3 hours and they presented a contract to sigh for our time share purchase . Given we had had no time to explore the resort and make any summation it was ridiculous to assume we would go down the path to purchase a time share that we could use a week every 2 years . It did not make financial sense ! Still they persisted ! On the way out we were taken to another office with a salesman to sell us a vacation we did not need for the following yr - and you guessed it at a heavily discounted rate . This experience was the Hilton sales machine in full swing . Eventually they handed us the vouchers and we were on our on our way ..... walking back to the beach there was a man in a booth - on the side of the booth it said , How to get out of your time share !!! Need I say more","June 25, 2019"
Had a great time at this resort! Family was very happy. Best possible location. Beautiful grounds. Family Lagoon was an extraordinary upgrade from any hotel pool. Very unique experience. Stay here if first time in Oahu. Gov't and military rates are not per diem - so buyer beware!,"June 25, 2019"

"Our base was Hilton Hawaiian village Waikiki. It is located in a convenient place . There is a 24/7 gym, business center, bars and restaurants sprawled around in this massive grounds. Lagoon and the beach is at the door step. There are plenty of shops and restaurants with in walking distance. Most of the tour operators pick up passengers from a location that is only a few minutes walk out of hotel grounds. Very friendly and helpful staff. We could see kids pool from the suite and it was always very busy. We loved the location and hospitality.","June 25, 2019"
"This was the 3rd and 4th times that I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It has been a while since I have stayed here, and I was pleasantly surprised with the return. Here are the highlights:Fitness Center: Loved the Gym! Very large area with all upgraded cardio equipment, weight machines, along with free weights. The small outdoor area is also a nice touch for core with a mat, etc Rooms: A little older, but still very large with upgraded amenities compared to other hotels during the same stay in Hawaii.Location: Right on the beach. Far enough to be away from some of the crowds of Waikiki while at the same time close enough to walk.Happy Hours: The price in HHV and Waikiki are generally high, so the addition of happy hours at some of the places in the viallage is a nice reprieve from the high costs.View: I had 2 different rooms in the stay and I actually did have some nice ocean views even without an upgraded room. If you pick a room on the ocean side, you may have some views, especially in the higher floors.Crowds: I was told by the front desk they have 4000 rooms here now and you can definitely tell. Everywhere you go there are lots of people. It was sort of overwhelming at times at check in and elevators, at the pool, etc.Fees: Be prepared for some of highest resort and parking fees in Waikiki. There are other close options for parking, especially for gov memebers,but the resort fee is part of the deal. I know that some places waive the resort fees for government members or if you just ask, but they do not.As long as you can overlook the typical resort and parking fees on Waikiki, along with the very large crowds, the HHV is a solid overall experience for one the biggest resorts on the Waikiki beach.","June 23, 2019"
"We are a family of 5 and were told that we must get a junior suite (larger room) which cost over $700/night. For that price I was expecting a superior room/hotel experience. Our room was larger to accommodate 5 but very ordinary, needed updating and definitely not worth $700 per night.In addition, we felt like nothing was included and everything was nickle and diming us.As an example, to rent a paddle board in the lagoon was over $40 for one hour. Umbrellas/chairs at the hotel beach cost extra..everything was extra (for $700 per night I should have stayed at the Ritz and gotten much better everything.)","June 23, 2019"
"We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for six days. Our room was in the Rainbow Tower on the tenth floor. We also booked an oceanfront room. It was myself my wife and one six year old. This property is huge with lots to do. There are lots of people staying here always. But if you plan just a little, it’s manageable and still relaxing. We paid more for an ocean front room. But I was glad I did. Having that view everyday was great. The room was a normal size room and worked fine for us. The room was clean and we had no complaints. There are plenty of food options and entertainment on the property that we enjoyed. I think we we were on the beach everyday. We rented chairs and umbrellas every day. One important thing to remember is. Someone needs to go downstairs at 8:30am to rent the chairs and umbrellas daily. Especially if you want a front spot to watch the kids in the ocean. Don’t rent anything else from them. Anything else you need just go to the ABC store and buy it. The price will be cheaper in the long run. We ate and drank and multiple locations on the property with no complaints. We booked a Luau at the Royal Hawaiian due to the Hilton’s is on the roof. The Royal Hawaiian Luau was a perfect 10. We enjoyed late night ice cream at Lappert’s and daily stops to the ABC store on the property. We bought clothing at Volcom’s and a purse for the wife at the LV store. Which is also on the property. Overall we enjoyed our stay and had a great time here.","June 23, 2019"
"We had a good time. Property is nice and large. We were there with two very large conventions and didn’t feel cramped at all. There are different towers to this property that have different styled themes and rooms. All towers have access to everything on property. It’s literally a village. Shops, food, entertainment, all in one place. Hawaii is expensive and this place is as well. But, still a nice hotel. ","June 23, 2019"

We stayed in the Diamond Tower Junior Suite. They are very old and tired rooms. Not at the Hilton level of excellence. Housekeeping was excellent. Fridge kept freezing all our foods and drinks. No microwave!! We were shocked there was none. That would have been so helpful. The resort is large. There was and Herbal Life conference going on so the gym was jam packed and the facilities were all so crowded (and noisy).,"June 22, 2019"
Our family of 8 had a wonderful week here at the Lagoon Towers Penthouse. Everything here is super pricey which is to be expected but we thought having a kitchen would help offset the cost of eating every meal out. It didn’t help except for adult beverages :) We still ate out all the time. Beds were comfy. AC worked well. Spacious and fabulous patio that spanned the entire length of the condo. No laundry in unit which was silly for the price. Overall we had a great time in paradise.,"June 21, 2019"

"Reviewed yesterdayI want to say this was our first trip to Hawaii and we loved the property. For any parents that have been to a Disney resort in Orlando, the complex is much the same. Large and spread out. The elevator system worked well, the bus depot is a ways away from everything, but I understand the reasoning for that. Our room was nice and always cleaned top notch.I only have a few complaints. 1. There are no umbrellas at the pools, while I am aware you can rent an umbrella at the beach or lagoon, they are not allowed in the pool area. This would be a huge help to those with littles that want to lay down, eat a snack, or even a parent needing a little shade. Not e ertlne wants to lay on the beach. My daughter had to find a shady corner and set on the ground to eat her shaved ice. 2. The food choices are not at all affordable for families. When having to spend $113 on breakfast for two adults and one child, it’s not feasible. An $80 steam for dinner is great one time, but not when the whole family has to eat. Thank goodness for the ABC stores! And third, but not last, probably the most important.. the check-in process. It was horrible! We stood in line for over an hour and then upon getting to the desk another hour.this was almost enough for me to want to say forget it and go elsewhere. After spending 8 hours on a plane the last thing I want to do is spend 2 more hours on the check in process. I’m not sure how they can remedy this other than to have more associates and to better train the ones they have. 4th: the lines and time waiting at the tours and activities desk is ridiculous! Most of this occurs from them trying to get you to listen to a pitch for the time share option on for a voucher or a credit! 5th, our room never got very cool. Thankfully, we bought our big box fan from home. . Overall, we greatly enjoyed our stay here.Show lessDate of stay: June 2019","June 19, 2019"
"We stayed at the Hilton Rainbow Tower for our wedding. They had a 50% off Jr. Suite Sale! The room was big and very spacious. This hotel property is very busy since there are servers towers and only one front desk/lobby area. The staff from the Bell Captain, to the valet people to the housekeeping staff were all pleasant and truly made you feel the “Aloha” spirit. If you ever plan an event at this hotel ask for Dayna in the Banquets Event Department! She was easy going, easy to work with and very patient! ","June 19, 2019"
"I stayed for a week with my daughter at the resort. The resort itself is beautiful. The grounds, coy ponds and parrots are a delight. There are several pools to choose from, my daughter chose the “super” pool everyday due to the huge size. The lagoon and beach were also walking distance.Check in and out were chaotic, especially for us arriving on a Saturday. Thankfully, there was a shorter line for HHoners Diamond members. Also, with Diamond status, I was given $10/day credit for myself and daughter in lieu of the free breakfast. The rooms are very mediocre for a Hilton property, yet clean though (Tapa)You can literally stay on the resort the entire stay if you wanted to, since all shops, restaurants and plenty activities are on site. We ventured into the island for day using the National car rental that was on the resort (book ahead or it will be sold out)Food were pricey, expected to be since we’re in Waikiki. Affordable breakfast can be had at the Wiki Wiki market (hot sandwiches or bagels) or ihop across the street. Starbucks line near the Tapa building was long, the secret is to go to the one in the Khalia building. I later discovered Lapperts coffee being very good and tasteful, they also offered toasted bagels for $3.50 plus other pastries. My daughter enjoyed ice cream treats there. We ate lunch/dinner at tropics, tapa bar and went onto Ala Moana blvd fee times. If you’re on a budget, Wiki Wiki market has a kids menu serving tenders, pasta, Mac n cheese at $11-$15 which I found reasonable. DQ also served hot dogs and burgers yet we didn’t try one. The ABC store were our go to for cold sandwiches, snacks and waterIt was pretty easy catching Charlie’s taxi cab at the front lobby, note that Uber and Lyft pick ups are near the diamond tower, which was out the way (Uber eats can drop off there too)","June 18, 2019"
"My son and I were trapped in an elevator with 10 others for close to 2 hours last weekend. This hotels elevators have no air conditioning so temperatures quickly rose to over 100 degrees making the situation unbearable. While trapped, we repeatedly called the front desk and sounded the fire alarm to get help. The operator at the front desk was totally unprepared to respond to our emergency and reaction time was extremely slow. As the conditions grew worse, I was forced to call 911 myself to request the fire department rescue us. The fire department revealed that the hotel had not called (but should have) and that they would be on site in minutes. After close to 2 hours, we were finally rescued by the fire department who helped us climb out. We later learned that the hotel knew the elevator was operating poorly but kept it running anyway (this could have been prevented)! After escaping I called the General Manager of the hotel who was not on site, and who to this day, has not responded to my message.","June 18, 2019"
Very average accommodations Bed was a little stiff ants in my bathroom And costly resort fee However the view was nice and the check out process was very convenient Would consider staying there again if they add a microwave to the Room,"June 17, 2019"
"The resort was great except the fact it took us a while to check in and though I requested to be able to check in early as I had young kids, we had to wait for 4-5 hours for the check in.We met with an accident whilst in Hawaii and though most of the staff was courteous about the situation, one manager named “Eliastturtado” went out of his way to support the situation. Its these small things that people do which adds a lot of value to your trips.Pools, beach, lagoons are great, kids had a lot of fun in the water and moving around.Thanks a lot Hilton for your services.","June 15, 2019"
"I travelled with my wife and two young kids, upon arrival we were offered an upgrade to the rainbow tower, this is right on the beach. We paid for our upgrade and then waited for our room be become available. Two hours later I was called and informed that there were no rooms available in the rainbow tower, and were then offered a juniour suite in the diamond tower. When I arrived at our juniour suite i realised it was right next to a noisy elevator, the room itself was very dark and basic. I ventured out onto the balcony and noticed one of the sunlounge chairs has a massive rip in it. I also noticed that the cement block dividing wall between our room and the one next to it was broken and in disrepair. We asked to be moved elsewhere, we were then offered a juniour suite in the tapa tower. This room has never been updated since it was built, there was a bad repair on the painted wall between the beds. I had a sore back for the entirerity of our stay as the matresses are spent. The carpet is in desperater need of a shampoo not just a quick vacuum. The shower head in the bathroom is hanging out of the wall, the window furnishings are beyond dated. For the price we paid to stay here, I cannot express how dissapoited we were with the accomodation provided. I would be embarrassed to reccommend this property to anyone.","June 14, 2019"
"It was our first time to the island and we had a great time, the hotel staff was supper friendly and everyone smiled and greeted us. The amenities were great we never would of had to leave the hotel they have everything on site.","June 14, 2019"
"I had read quite a few negative reviews about HHV leading up to our trip (a lot of positive ones too, to be fair), so I wanted to be sure to mention how much we absolutely loved our stay. It was for our honeymoon and could not have been more special. And a lot of that is due to HHV. Obviously Waikiki beach is a stunning location on its own and then HHV’s grounds are stunning as well. Our room was in the Rainbow Tower and we had a beautiful view of Diamond Head and a private lanai. We spent most of our time on the beach or in the lagoon. Our favorite things to do were rent the fun paddle boards and aqua cycles in the lagoon and grab lunch at the delicious shrimp truck by the lagoon. We also loved starting our morning by going to Cinnamon’s next door at the Ilikai or Goofy’s, which is a short walk away on Ala Moana Blvd. (just be sure to get yo both early since you will run into a long wait otherwise!) We also ate at Tropics several times, and while pricey, their food is delicious and the atmosphere is great (with an ocean view). And it still isn’t as pricey as some other restaurants nearby. Be sure to catch the Friday night fireworks during your stay too!Overall, I could not have been more pleased with our stay and with the service received there, and we can’t wait to go back. Whenever we head to Hawaii again, I will head for HHV. We miss it already! Thank you for our cherished honeymoon memories.","June 14, 2019"
"I have stayed here many times and have been in a few different towers, not all of them offer the same nice updated rooms, so do your research on the different towers within this complex. Rainbow tower and Ali'i of course are amazing views and the rooms are very nice. This hotel is huge and it's like its own little village with shops, restaurants and the Lagoon, there is a kid pool with slides and two other big pools, it is walking distance to so many places and you can stroll down the beach or the sidewalk. It is not as busy on this side of the beach as it is in the middle of Waikiki. It offers Fireworks every Friday night on the beach infront of the hotel for free that are actually really nice and big. Over all, this is a beautiful hotel and I keep going back.","June 14, 2019"
"Ryan from the front desk was amazing! Super insightful, had a wonderful vibe, and complimentary upgraded me to a beautiful room! Really made me feel welcomed as a Gold Hilton Honors member and Team member! YOU ROCK RYAN! MAHALO!","June 13, 2019"
"We have been going to the Hilton for 35 years. We love the people, the atmosphere and the proximity to great restaurants and shops. We have made great friends over the years. Nancy Jones works at the front desk and someone we always look forward to seeing. She helps to make our vacation extra special! The best thing about the Hilton is being on the famous Waikiki beach. It just can't be beat! I highly recommend this hotel, especially for families.","June 13, 2019"
"This is a very large property, which becomes obvious from the moment you are driven up to the very large and open air reception desks. We stayed here for two nights after the end of three weeks of travel. We had a lovely view across the lagoon, a spacious room and enjoyed watching the sunset and the nightly show on a terrace nearby. The staff were courteous and friendly -- we did have one issue, but when we brought it to the attention of the duty manager, he was quick to address it and offered to pay for our cab to the airport (we graciously accepted).I think this would be an even better location for a family than an older couple passing through. While we enjoyed it, we didn't make use of the resort facilities -- the pools, lagoon, beach etc. It would have been a great spot for kids and grandkids to gather and enjoy. That said, I did wind up buying a dress from one of the boutiques for my daughter (it was a great bargain) and picking up cookies from the honolulu cookie company store.... and we browsed through a number of the stores on the site. In fact, what we really enjoyed was walking through the very large grounds, looking at all the bird life. I'd definitely consider this an option if looking for a destination hotel in hawaii for all the family.","June 12, 2019"
"It's a Hilton, so it's nicely maintained and a gorgeous property.. We went in late September and could never get chairs by the pool, early morning people put their stuff on the chairs (including a single towel or a rock) to reserve them and then never show up until late in the day. We used the pool at the Hale Koa next door our entire stay (we are military). $30 daily resort fee is bogus even though all the hotels charge the fee. Parking ridiculously expensive, even a diet coke from the pool bar is $9. I love Hiltons and rack up the loyalty points with them whenever I can however, I don't think I would book this property again, it was over $300/nt and we did not see the value in it. The grounds are nice and the resort shopping is nice.. But you can stay elsewhere and still enjoy the shopping.","June 11, 2019"
"A comprehensive resort with food, drinking, shopping, several pool options, a lagoon, private beach and fireworks from the beach on Fridays--we love it here. Waikiki is a short walk down the beach path and it has a lot to offer, but the HHV is not as crazy (even though it is very busy) and has everything a family could need. Some of the towers are being turned into condo/time shares..we stay in Tapa Tower which works perfect for us.","June 11, 2019"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village is definitely the perfect place to stay. Excellent location for restaurants, shopping, and of course the beach. If you don’t want to spend all of your time on the beach, you can enjoy the beautiful pools with all of there amenities.","June 11, 2019"
"My wife and I just loved our 7 days in Hawaii, and we could not have picked a better hotel to experience it. Tucked in-between the ocean and the lagoon gave us the perfect view from the Rainbow Tower, and the staff truly made us feel like Ohana “Family”, as did just about every Hawaiian we met. Truly a magical place! From the clean clear turquoise beach & lagoon, the awesome pools, the great restaurants, and the shopping, all on the premises, we really didn’t have to leave the resort. But we did do several island tours & loved everyone of them. And it was great to return back to our resort, as each time it felt like we were returning home to rest after a long wonderful day!!! We can’t wait to come back, only next time we are bringing the whole family.... Mahalo, to all the Hilton Hawaiian Village Staff The Salazar’s","June 10, 2019"
"Family vacation with parents, teenager and young adult kids. Stayed in the Ali’i Tower and it was beyond great!!! The service in this Tower was on point. We were able to walk into Waikiki. Beach is literally 20 steps out the Ali’i Tower!!! ","June 10, 2019"
"I just returned from this hotel with my family of 6. On the positive side:Hotel has lots of areas and activities for families to enjoy - beautiful beach, views, sunset was amazing. Our rooms were quiet and comfortable for family of 6Our request for joining rooms was accommodated at check inLots of pools with towel exchange provided A lot of tours pick up here, many restaurants/shops in walking distanceComplimentary room given to change on check out dayOn the negative side:Reviews are correct about really long wait to check in - this needs to be improved. Took over an hour to get to check in desk in line, then another 30 minutes at the deskFood on property is easily 2X price that of other restaurants in the immediate area - we either ate off property or went to local ABC (convenient) store and brought back to hotel Concierge wasn't able to answer questions I had about the area, but instead pushed their tours","June 9, 2019"
"The resort is great and they have made the best of the space they have available.i would not stay here again but only because I am not at all enjoying being in the city but if you want to visit Oahu and use your Hilton privileges you dont really have much choice. The prices at the resort are pretty ridiculous but there are lots of places to eat close by that are much more reasonable for those who dont want to splurge on every meal. Overall, very nice place !","June 9, 2019"
"We were told we had an upgrade when we arrived. The room turned out to be next to the lift shaft so hardly an upgrade due to the noise. Room was not serviced daily. The Ali’i Pool is supposed to be for exclusive use of guests but it was not. We witnessed bracelets being handed out to a group of loud, rude, and vulgar Americans that ruined a lovely afternoon. I have cancelled future bookings with Hilton as this is not the service we paid for.","June 9, 2019"
"We split our booking into 2 separate stays - 4 nights on the 12th floor in an ocean view room in Rainbow tower, off to Maui for 4 nights, then back for 3 nights in Ali’i Tower on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool and ocean. We loved our stay both times. The rooms were spacious & clean, beds and pillows comfortable and service mostly friendly. The resort is massive on 22 acres, conveniently fronts onto the beach and includes multiple pool swimming pools, restaurants and shops. We enjoyed being able to get up early and walk to the beach in 2 minutes for a snorkel, then head back for a shower. We only ate breakfast at the hotel once (the omelette was pretty good but they need to improve the bacon in the buffet area!) and found the restaurants 10 minutes away towards the main part of town were better value (the omelettes at Eggs ‘n Things & Denny’s were just as good).We found that although the location is just outside the main beach area, it suited us as we enjoyed the short walk to both the Ala Moana shops in one direction and the main shops and restaurants around Lewers St in the other. If I were to return to Hawaii, I would stay here again.","June 9, 2019"
"The hotel is beautiful! The area is surrounded with high-rises Lots of traffic. Lots of people. Lots of shopping. Located right on the marina, our hotel views the ocean’s gorgeous blue sparkling water. It’s fun watching the surfers.","June 9, 2019"
"Our stay was from 1 June to 5 June 2019 - 2 rooms in the Rainbow Tower....the tower and the resort generally was less than clean, the lifts terrible. Our rooms had cockroaches, holes in the sheets, shocking bed for a 4* hotel, pillows were terrible, a crack in the toilet seat...just terrible...do not book this resort, it might look pretty but the is not pleasant. Most of the staff were rude and not helpful. do NOT recommend","June 8, 2019"
"Check in lines were long, but went by quickly. I am a Diamond Hilton Honors member and had a separate check in line. Courteous staff and was in the room in 20 mins. Used my annual Rewards certificate for 2 nights. Got thenTapa Tower. Not the 2 prized buildings, Rainbow Tower and Lagoons Towers on the beach, but it’s summer and the property must be booked. Here’s my photos of the room. Looking for a relaxing couple days before I head to Sapporo. ","June 8, 2019"
"I had a best time in Honolulu, like this hotel, great beach and beautiful view! Gotta love Hawaii and Oahu island. When you are there nothing can go wrong. So happy that I had a oportunity to visit this amazing place! Hotel was more than Ok, great location, rooms have a great view, lot of restaurants.","June 8, 2019"
"Hilton Hawaiian village, truly feels like a village so many restaurants and shops within walking distance of your room. The hotel is right on the beach and has many pools and is super friendly, has many activities for everyone to take part in. The hotel is located near everything needed. Highly recommend doing the hotels luau and recommend paying a little extra to have the better seat and more drinks faster entrances and leis! Also make sure to be there on a Friday night go see the fireworks!! ","June 7, 2019"
"This resort is absolutely beautiful & in a great location! We stayed in the Rainbow Building in an ocean front room. The view was breath taking. The beach is just steps from the building. The water is so clear & calm. The resort has so many places to eat & shop, you almost don’t have to leave! If I get to go back to Oahu, I’ll definitely be staying here again!","June 7, 2019"
"This Hilton is amazing! It sits on a property of 22 acres, right on the beach. I give this property 5 Star rating. There were days that there was no need to even leave the property, there is shopping, variety of places to eat Benihana is one of my favorites! They have a tour center where you can buy tickets for activities. I would suggest the Rainbow Tower, the you cannot go wrong with the amazing views. I highly recommend this Hilton!!","June 6, 2019"
We came to Honolulu after traveling for 22 hours. Walking into the Ali’i tower’s lobby we were warmly welcomed and their signature scent was enticing to our weary bodies. We had a direct ocean view room which was spacious and immaculately clean. Being Hilton Honors members we were given a credit towards breakfast. We chose Starbucks and the credit covered our breakfast sandwiches and coffee. Our main purpose was to visit Pearl Harbor so we spent all day there and then headed to our sunset cruise. Highly recommended. ( see my review)Checkout time couldn’t be extended but we were offered a hospitality suite to shower. Walking distance to upscale shops and lots of restaurants. Wonderful stay! ,"June 6, 2019"
"Hotel is located in the very center of Honolulu and it's surroundings are very hectic and busy. Would NOT recommend for a quiet, relaxing honeymoon. This being my first time to Hawaii I was very exciting and everything was beautiful to me. There are many shops (gift), restaurants, and there is a Starbucks that opens at 6:00 am in the village. Hotel staff very polite and friendly. Rooms were clean and so was the beach. We were on the 11th floor of Diamond Tower, didn't hear any noise. Trolley does stop at the hotel which allows you to see the City. It also has room for the tour buses, which was very convenient for us, since we took tours.","June 6, 2019"
"This hotel is the worst. I am so disappointed i spent my summer vacation money here. If you like literally throwing money away, you will love this place. The grounds are beautiful. That is it. It is so dated and expensive. You seriously question multiple times during the day, did that really just cost that much? Food is hardly passable as okay and extremely expensive. Yes, this is a family resort, but how on earth can they charge as much as they do for a family resort? I don't mind spending money but it has to be worth it. It made me sick to think how much they were charging for crap! or bare necessities. All the staff from check in to towel / pool attendants were extremely rude. Pools are freezing cold and jet cold water into them throughout the day. I would never recommend and will never come again. Honestly, this whole experience has turned me off of Hawaii entirely. Shame. I would rather spend my money somewhere in the Caribbean and have warm water, better views, updated amenities and all inclusive. Oh , all the ""fun amenities"" they claim to have on site also cost an extremely high additional costs. Even umbrellas and chairs for the beach. Can you believe this? For the amount of money everything costs, you would think simple things like beach chairs would be provided. Please stay away. I ignored the bad reviews and regret completely. NOT worth it. you WILL regret this. my 3 year old could not wait to come home along with everyone else. That should say something. BTW i tried writing a review earlier and Hilton Honors would not let me submit. Clearly they know their resort is crap!","June 6, 2019"
After 5 hours of trying to get a new room due to sinks backing up with rusty water and pipes ringing in the walls I ended up with less than what I paid for. 3 beds turned into 2 and a uncomfortable sofa couch. The space was downsized by more than half. I missed a family outing to deal with this and had to more a family of 4 to another tower by myself. Hilton could have taken better care of us and not waisted my time. Not like they don't have what 6/7? towers.,"June 6, 2019"
"Wouldn’t stay again. Grounds are lovely but way too busy the public can use the pools free of charge.. So why do hotel guests have to pay a resort fee if anyone can use the pools? On top of the absorbent amount that you already pay for your room. Next time I’ll stay somewhere else and just walk over into your grounds and use your pools will save me lots of money. The room was musty smelling and so was the whole floor to be honest. Yep nice view if you like all the buildings in front of you ‘ocean view but not worth the rude staff we encountered. (Granted there was 1 or 2 of nice front desk & restaurant staff) Room was old. Couch had a disgusting stain on it. Pillows were horrible. We also had forgotten our key one day & went down to the reception at our tower but they said no you have to walk over to reception- which was quite a hike. I then wait in line for 20 minutes to be told that I could have rung maintenance from the phone on our floor… ARE YOU JOKING! Why couldn’t the reception in our tower tell us that. Biggest rip off. Will definitely be returning to the Sheraton next time we are in Hawaii.Had notified hotel that would be arriving at 7.30am but when we arrived at 9.30am room wasn’t ready until 3pm. Then they tried to say they can get us another room for $75USD JUST TO GET IN EARLY!!! The room was already cleaned and it didn’t have a partial ocean view room like we had booked and it had 2 beds instead of 1 that we requested (& WE WERE ON OUR HONEYMOON!!!).... why would I pay $75 extra for something I don’t even want. So we waited. I completely understand having a check in time but if you are offering me a room that’s ready and not what I had booked then you can at least let me in free of charge. They also asked for a $630USD deposit which was fine even though our total resort fees were $280. This I had no issue with. My issue is when I start being charged $19.60, $59 over my stay and then a whopping $187 (on our checkout day). When I asked the reception they said they were deposits & would be released to me... but you’ve already taken sooo much as a deposit... why would you need those extra deposits. Very rude and uncalled for. On the bright side the Italian restaurant is fantastic & so is the ice cream shop!","June 5, 2019"
"First impression was that it is a very busy area! It really is a village, more for families with kids. There seemed to be a lack of music throughout the complex. There are definitely a lot of shops for everyones fix. The beach was close and the water was perfect! The only thing I did not like was the fact hotel guest have to pay for an umbrella and each chair, average $60+ a day (until 5pm), the resort fee does not cover this, resort charge $40, excise tax $9.26, room tax $20.13, (per day). The wifi was so bad I had to keep it off. I know it's Hawaii so I guess expect to pay for everything! Smaller island next time.","June 5, 2019"
"We are currently staying at the Ali’i tower in a corner king room. The room is spacious and the view is great. However, this resort is like being at Universal Studios in Orlando in the summer. It is completely overcrowded, understaffed, and lacking in customer service. Check in was a zoo despite our Hilton Honors status and having completed online checkin. Lines are long and poorly organized, turning into a free for all as people cut, go to wrong lines, and staff doesn’t care or direct traffic. The drop off/valet is constantly clogged with so many cars, it takes forever just to pull around to the valet desk. Again, not enough staff keeping at least one of the 3 lanes open so returning guests can get to the valet desk without waiting for every taxi and van to unload new arrivals and all their luggage. Incredibly long lines for any restaurant, Starbucks, etc. Very limited room service menu with high surcharges clearly designed to discourage room service use; room service offerings come from a snack bar, are of mediocre quality, and you cannot order breakfast the night prior, so you are stuck with long lines every morning just to eat or get coffee. There are a few family activities, but not as many as I expected for a “family” resort (movies on Wednesday and Saturday, lei making classes, and a kids club). When needing to replace a DVD rental card so my child could participate in the lei making class, I was directed by the concierge to the massive mail/key line. Despite leaving 30 min early for the class, I barely made it in time due to the wait and, again, the huge number of people cutting in line that staff did nothing about, even after the woman in front of me complained and staff acknowledged it was happening. I waited 15-20 min for someone to spend 30 seconds handing me a card. I just came back from the Ritz in London, spent a similar amount per night on my room there, and the service difference is laughable. For upgraded prices and “amenities” in the Ali’i tower, I would also expect the Ali’i tower staff and concierge to perform some of these tasks such as replacing a card. Also, there is ongoing construction next door with loud machinery daily.","June 5, 2019"
Love the idea of being in one part of the island and walking around to great places to eat and spend time with the family. Kid friendly and the trip was a nice getaway. Rooms were a bit outdated but the premise was lovely.,"June 4, 2019"
"The acomadateions are first class, comes with 4 pools, ocean beach, private lagoon, restaurants, shops and more. We just love it being Hilton owners with all its perks. Everyone is so friendly and accommodating. ","June 4, 2019"
"I love this hotel everything. As a Diamond member, I got a lovely room for our honeymoon (Tapa tower, 1 bedroom suit corner view). This room has beautiful ocean view and good amenities. Only bad thing is no microwave in entire hotel zone. And the hotel is too big to find directory. Anyway, I will visit this hotel later. Really recommend this hotel to you guys!","June 4, 2019"
"Arrived late in the afternoon only to be advised that whilst we had booked an ocean view room above level 15 level the room allocated was on the lowest floor with no view. Staff advised that there was no other room available but offered an upgrade for an additional $$ cost. After a lengthy discussion with a very helpful staff member we were eventually offered the room as originally booked provided we stay one night in the lower level room.The room finally provided whilst having a great view was in need of renovation, the bed was comfortable and the room clean. The resort itself was very crowded particularly the pools .There are a number of restaurants if you had no need to to venture outside the complex but would suggest taking advantage of the local bus service or walk along the boardwalk to Waikiki as there are a number of excellent restaurants close by.Would we stay there again, probably not.","June 3, 2019"
"Came with the family. Had a blast. I quite like the location. Its not on the main strip but thats what I loved about it. Close enough but not right there. Great pools, beach is great, rooms were nice. I think food prices are too high though. preferred to eat out.","June 3, 2019"
"After reading reviews, we expected to have excellent customer service and beautiful rooms. However, our experience was the exact opposite. Our original room was filthy. It looked like it had not been properly cleaned in months. Our bed sheets were stained, the sinks and the tub had visible grime, the tile floors had hair, dust and crumbs on it. The list goes on. I was uncomfortable staying there so they gave us another room. Our new room was better, but still dirty and unacceptable in my opinion. There was a lot hair on my bathroom floor. Like a woman had emptied her hairbrush on the ground. There was also urine at the base of the toilet, that remained there during our entire stay! The inside of the bathroom drawer was stained plywood, no liner. The back of the bathroom door had a hole and screw exposed. The tv remote was sticky and dirty, there was discolored spots on bathroom door, mascara spots on the mirror, the tv was dusty. And the list goes on. I did not get a pleasant response from customer service. They seemed irritated and too busy to bother with me. So I bought Lysol disinfecting wipes and spray and did some light cleaning. I used towels to cover the bathroom floor everyday so my feet were not touching that nasty bathroom floor. The common areas in my building (Tapa) also need repairs and a thorough cleaning. The carpets appeared dirty with visible dirt and debris. There was a white blanket of dust on the wood floors, especially near and under the furniture and around the baseboards. It had obviously not been vacuumed, swept or mopped in a very long time. There were places where wallpaper was peeling away from the wall, the ice machine was broken, etc. That building. The entire Tapa building needs a complete overhaul. I don't need my hotel rooms to be brand new, but I do expect them to be clean! Customer service was not great either. Needless to say, I will not be staying at a Hilton ever again!","June 2, 2019"
Clean as looks just like photos. Pools and beach were great. You might want to wear water shoes or a pair of socks at the beach in certain areas the reef / rocks are a bit sharp. Beach area just to the right of the pier was better. Tropics Grill & Rainbow Lanai had great breakfast options. Pizza & ice cream here were good. Staff was very friendly. Stayed in the lagoon tower and no problems with a wait at the elevator. Would take speedy shuttle to & from airport rather than Roberts only because Roberts had to pick us up at the hotel next door.,"June 2, 2019"
"I took my granddaughter to Hawaii for a cruise of the islands. We flew in early so we would have time to see Oahu. I chose the Hawaiian Village because I felt is was more kid friendly for her. When we arrived we were upgraded to the Rainbow Tower. Our room was on the 9th floor and on an end. We had a wonderful view of the ocean as well as the courtyard and its pool. It was spectacular in my opinion. The way the elevator system works was wonderful. No lines and no waiting. Loved it! I would recommend this property, but for me it was pricey.","June 2, 2019"
Best Vacation of my life!! This Hilton is absolutely astonishing in size let alone your first trip to Hawaii!. More like a Las Vegas feel 1000’s of employees! Tons of stuff to do! Right on the beach. Everyone we encountered was having the time of their lives as well as us! The Tropics bar and restaurant was great! And all the pool side bars and Starbucks right on property! Very nice layout and beautiful breathtaking scenery at every corner. The hotel has tons of activities you can sign up for! As well as a kids camp! Loved the hotel can’t wait to return! Go check it out for yourself! Never a dull moment at the Hilton Hawaiian village!,"June 2, 2019"
The housekeeping did amazing job. The pool area nice. But security is weak theft is major issues at hotels i believe still.They made the bed with my two blankets from home.

"After staying in a budget hotel in Waikiki, I found myself wanting more. As I had days before proposed to my partner I thought it appropriate to upgrade to a better hotel and enjoy our last 6 days in Hawaii. I found a great deal on Expedia and found ourselves on our way to the rainbow tower at the Hilton Hawaiian village. Check in although can have long queues we were greeted by a wonderful desk clerk who expedited our check in and gave us a great explanation of the surrounding areas. Our baggage was attended by bell hops and yes they still call them bellhops. We took in the views of wildlife as well as gardens and the surrounding waterfalls as we made our way to our room. And what a room ocean front 17th floor! WOW. the staff brought our bags after a brief conversation and were there in no time. They are efficient and extremely pleasant they can’t do enough for you, and that is reflected in the tip. Over all we felt relaxed as soon as we entered the hotel and our posture and stress levels certainly dropped after being in town and experienced crowds, homelessness, and noise from sirens every night. Thanks you HiltonHawaiian Village for a restful stay. We will be back. 1st picture view from our room to beach.2nd the super pool. 3rd Waikiki and Diamond head from our room. 4th the sunset a short walk to the jetty from our tower. 5th picture Cynthia barmaid at Huatree bar excellent service beautiful lady. 6th picture enjoying the drink hautree bar. 7th us enjoying another day in front of rainbow tower. 8th paradise pool for family and kids especially because of the water slides. 9th our room rainbow tower oceanfront","June 1, 2019"
"Booked 2 rooms (adjoining) for our family.Went to the Hilton Honors check in line. Check in was slow and seemed to be understaffed. Was informed that the hotel did not have adjoining rooms, not that they weren't available, but they did not have adjoining rooms. I questioned this but was repeatedly given the same story. So, we ended up with 2 rooms on the same floor. Check in experience was not great. We were not given a map of the property and were given verbal instructions how to find our room. The property has multiple towers and we initially ended up in the wrong tower. Staff in that tower provided clear direction to the correct tower. Definitely room for improvement in this process.When we entered the first room, the first thing we saw was a door to an adjoining room, which we were told didn't exist. Obviously, we were not pleased.Both rooms were nice but nothing special. In our opinion and based on our sore backs, the beds are way too soft. The property is beautiful and with the exception of pigeon control, was well maintained. The pool area don't provide much shade for those of us that can't stay in direct sun the entire day. The surrounding buildings provide shade at various times of the day based on the path of the sun. Umbrellas were not available. Umbrella's and chairs were available for rent at the beach. Beach is very nice. Pigeons are an issue anytime food is present around the pool and sometimes when there isn't food. Pigeons are also a problem in the Tropics Bar and Grill which is beach side. Netting is in place around the perimeter but the doors are left open. Pigeons landed on tables, chairs, etc. Pigeons droppings were noted in multiple locations. We experienced multiple aggressive pigeons when trying to eat. Aren't Pigeon droppings known to carry Salmonela?Another issue in Tropics was a family letting a child (approximately 18 months) run around in the restaurant without pants, diaper, etc. Then the couple had him sitting on the chairs, table, etc. without pants, diaper, etc. Didn't really need to see this while dining. Glad we weren't the next customers at that table. Waitress saw it but nothing was done. Inquired about late check in because our flight was at 9:00 pm. Told it was not available without additional charges. I agreed to pay the $150 for one room then was told she would have to talk with her Supervisor because it may not be available. Then why did you offer it? Supervisor called me about 3 hours later to let me know they would accommodate the late check outOverall, it's a nice property but management needs to improve the overall operation of the facility, including check in experience, take better care of Hilton Honors members, deal with the pigeon issue, training of staff, etc.","June 1, 2019"
"I just loved my trip from beginning to end. The food was amazing, the service was exactly what I needed. If I had the opportunity to move, I would definitely make Maui my home. The people are friendly and it’s so much to do!!!!","June 1, 2019"
"It’s no Sheraton or Royal Hawaiian in terms of location, but it is just central enough that it works. It’s close to a number of decent restaurants (we didn’t eat onsite at all), and views of the beach and Diamond Head are astounding. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower with a beachfront view. We were hoping for a Diamond Head view from our room, but ended up with a corner room that looked onto the ocean and lagoon. Turned out to be a pretty decent view (we were on an upper floor) and the room was nice and large, with two lanais. Room quality is typical of a Hilton, as are staff and services offered. There are lots of pools, and none of them seemed overcrowded while we were there. The lagoon is a nice option for families with small children, but we preferred the ocean side with the break wall. All things considered (price, location, quality, services), we’d probably look to Hilton Hawaiian Village as our first choice for a future visit to Waikiki!","June 1, 2019"
"Recently stayed at this property for 5 nights, we were very pleased with the customer service we received during our check in. We were given a wonderful room in the diamond head tower with ocean view. Front desk agent gave us coupons for 2 free cupcakes @ wiki wiki market when she found out we were getting married ( didn’t get to try them). Overall I enjoyed the resort it was exactly what I expected the big resort with a big vacation feel! I loved our room and waking up to the wonderful ocean view cannot be topped. What I found was lacking was a few things for one, the housekeeping services, having been to many big chain hotels in major tourist cities, I felt they were lacking in this area. We would come back to the room to glasses still laying around and no glasses to reuse. (They provide two) I thought maybe they were tying not to throw away the drink but it’s clearly watered so... would’ve been nicer if put away. Another thing I didn’t not understand/like was the fact that there was no microwave in the property. They provide a mini fridge in the room but no microwave in a common area or in a market to reheat food, or anything. I thought maybe staff could’ve been more accommodating there and offered to help with heating up a meal, because there really must be a single microwave in the massive property. Really those were my two downsides. It’s great for families and if you’re going as a couple not wanting to see kids maybe stay elsewhere. Tropics bar was really nice with beach views but definitely resort prices. Took full advantage of bar at tapa tower.Tip:behind the lagoon there is a parking lot, look for yellow food truck. Amazing food and cheap!!","May 30, 2019"
"The first night we stayed here, there was a cockroach crawling around in our room!! We called the front desk to have someone take care of it, but it wasn't cleaned up until the next morning by the housekeepers. The response was that ""It's Hawaii, there are cockroaches."" The hotel itself is secluded from all the other properties, and it's a 10-15 minute walk to get to all the nice shops and beach. I would not recommend staying at this place. It's very dirty and not a good location at all. Plus my ""Ocean View"" room that I paid for was apparently was only an ""ocean view from the balcony."" Annoying thing was that a Hilton worker said that the cockroach probably came in because I opened the balcony door...ALSO - I could hear our neighbor's closing the toilet seat and flush every single time! It was a bit gross to hear this, as it sounded like the toilet was right next to our bed. I don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel where I could hear the neighbor flush the toilet.","May 29, 2019"
This resort is amazing. It has all the amenities you could think of. The registration desk staff were very helpful during check-in. The room itself was spotless. The view was amazing. The tropical bar is a must eat at location. Plenty of shops for the shoppers out there. ,"May 29, 2019"
Very nice rooms. I requested a room with an ocean view and it was on the 13th floor and had a great view of the ocean and the beach. The bed was comfortable and the complimentary wifi worked well. House keeping was very good at cleaning the room and making the bed. The onsite restaurants I visited were excellent.,"May 28, 2019"
"As Hilton properties go, this place is up to standard. Rooms are spacious with great views. Resort has lots to do with large pools, bars, and is right on the beach. Expect large crowds due to its popularity. Not a secluded Hawaii destination but all good. ","May 28, 2019"
We had a very nice room with incredible beach and water front property. Our room was a nice suite on the top floor. Staff was helpful and friendly. This hotel has a very nice beach area and several pools. Many restaurants and shopping to choose from. We had a very nice stay. Location is very good.,"May 27, 2019"
"We just returned from another 11 night stay at the Ali tower, as always we love this resort and the friendly staff. Our room was on the 14th floor with a lovely view of the resort pool and ocean , just glorious to sit and enjoy a drink.We had a issue with our mattress being so soft and very uncomfortable but after two days and finally dealing with the manager Kevin I believe was his name was fixed Thankyou . The room was extremely clean and very well serviced each day.","May 26, 2019"
"If you would like a resort feel with restaurants, shopping, activities all on site then this is your place. It really is like its own little village. I found the property restaurants just mediocre and over priced. The bars are your typical well, slushy drinks, etc. But again if this is your thing you will love it. If you are looking for a more intimate, laid back or boutique place you will not be happy here.","May 26, 2019"
"My 9 year old and I are just back from a 9 day stay for a Cheerleading Competition and then holiday. We loved the resort. Especially the pools and beach. Nice having a choice and all different, her favourite pool was the waterslide one, although the long slide closed at 5pm and the rest at 7pm which was a shame. The resort had a nice relaxed feel to it and even with hundreds of Cheerleaders it didn't feel as busy as ones we have been to in the Middle East, etc. The room was an ok size with a small balcony, very plain though. Fridge was very small. Lots of draws if you want to unpack and good sized wardrobe. We tended to mainly eat outside of the hotel as once the taxes & tip are added it was quite expensive. The ABC shops (2 in the resort) are great for breakfast, lunch and snack foods. As the resort is at the end of Waikiki Beach it isn't so busy but still walking (or short taxi ride) distance to the centre. We caught the bus into the centre 3x for dinner and taxi'd back. Ala Moana Mall (which is great for shopping and eating) is also walking distance (the the other direction). If you want loungers and umbrella's on the beach you need to pay to hire them so I recommend buying at Walmart if you plan to spend a few days on the beach. We stayed in the Tapa Tower. My only complaint with that tower was there was a live band every night at the Tapa Bar and the music was pretty loud in the room, especially Fri/Sat, until about 11pm. Loved Waikiki and will definately be back!","May 26, 2019"
"We have stayed twice now at the Hawaiian Hilton Resort in Waikiki. Once without kids and once with. I think it is a fantastic place to stay just outside of the hustle and bustle of the city centre, and even more suited to families, especially with young kids. The pools are world class. You need to get there early to score a good chair poolside, but having said that hawaii doesn’t really wake up till around 10am!!!There is even a pool with water slides for kids of all ages and it’s easy to get food and drinks by the pool, making it somewhere where you can relax for most of the day before taking the 10min walk to the centre of town along the beachfront. I highly recommend staying at the Hilton Village when in Waikiki,Hawaii. You will be well looked after by the staff, get to relax (located just on the outside of the city centre) and there’s plenty to do. Towels are made available with the resort card, meaning you can trade for fresh clean pool towels once you have used them, saving you from trying to dry out and reuse towels when you get out of the water. Relax and enjoy your stay. ","May 25, 2019"
Well the hotel was in a great spot but dirty carpets red punch stain all over will this is a hard one had 2 bottle of wine and some other stuff taken from our room reported it. Management was good about it. Had to pay40 a day for resort fee then payed to get a chair at the beach to set on. Plus the safe didn't work. Probably wont stay there again.,"May 25, 2019"
"This is a beautiful resort right on the beach at Waikiki. It is a timeshare style resort, so the rooms are apartment style with kitchens, etc. We are not timeshare owners, so the booking was like a regular hotel, with housekeeping services every day.Management had sent me an e-mail indicating a different tower than I'd booked, so we had the taxi drop us off there. There was no wait for check in, but it was the wrong tower, so once checked in we had to roll our suitcases down the sidewalk to the Kalia tower (the nice lady at check in did offer to get someone to take us and our bag over in a cart, but we figured we could manage.)The Kalia tower is probably the furthest away from the main pool (it does have its own child free one) and our view was of the city, but it was quiet.There are a lot of amenities at this resort that we didn't have time for as we were only there for 3 nights prior to a cruise. The days that we were there were filled with sightseeing and the Hawaiian Village was a convenient base from which to explore. Each morning, I was able to walk on the beach and watch the sun rise.On our embarkation day, we wanted hike diamond head before going to the cruise terminal. The bell captain was able to store our luggage for us (we wouldn't have been back in time to check out) and we just stopped by the hotel and picked up the bags on our way to the terminal when we were ready.","May 25, 2019"
"Missed a flight to Lihue and was put up at the Hilton by the airline. Given an ocean front suite on the 16th floor by an empathetic front desk employee. Fed excellent fair at the hotel restaurant. Enjoyed the beach and then poolside patio. The resort is spacious, well maintained, and very attractive. Hope to become a paying customer oneday!!","May 25, 2019"
"Stayed in Diamond tower during a conference/meeting. Not my idea of a nice hotel. While everything was readily available, it was always overcrowded with long lines...to check-in, for meals, to go to pool, to get towels, to get ice cream. Location was okay, easy walking distance to shops and more shops and more shops, but overall quite redundant. The rooms are also in bad need of updating or at least replacing worn out furniture that appear to have been used by thousands of guests before me. Staff were friendly and overall can't complain too much about being in Hawaii, so 3 stars.","May 24, 2019"
"This is a very nice property in a great location. Our room was beautiful with a great view. I enjoyed my coffee on the patio each morning. From the moment we arrived, the service was unimpressive. We were dropped off at the tour bus terminal after a 14 hour flight. With all of the people, we did not see the tiny sign that pointed toward the lobby. With our 4 suitcases, we followed the crowd onto a nearby elevator. Long story short, it took us 30 minutes with NO help( we asked 5 different staff members for directions) to find the check in area. We waited in line for 45 minutes to check in. I am a Hilton Honors member and waited in that line while my husband waited in regular check in line. He was first. We had no bell hop assistance and wheeled our luggage across the very large resort to our room. At the pool, I took my pool card to grab a couple towels. The guy took my card and handed me a towel. I said, "" Oh I need 2 please"". Very rudely, he responded ""One card ,one towel, you need to learn to follow directions"". I handed my towel back and did not swim in the pool. Not sure if I would stay here again.","May 24, 2019"
"Top notch staff, beautiful property, loved all 10 days we were there. Highly recommend! We took our adult daughters and had a great time. Beach and grounds are more beautiful in person than any of the photos.","May 23, 2019"
"What a wonderful vacation you don’t even have to leave the resort like it’s own little city. A bit big but you will learn how to navigate around quick. Food, drink, swim, entertainment you name it it’s all there ","May 23, 2019"
"Environnement is nice, with direct access to beach. Staff is very friendly.But, service needs to be definitely improved.1) arrival : waiting for 1 hour to check-in as front desk is understaffed!2) Room cleaning: they forgot to clean my room and when I asked to concierge by what time I could expect room to be cleaned: sorry today it is too late. Concierge not rude but she did not feel this was an issue for such a hotel. I was invited to Grand Vacation presentation but, the room cleaning experience did not incite me to go further than the presentation.The issues above: this is really a pity because overall this hotel provides a nice experience but hotel seems understaffed everywhere or staff not really serious.","May 23, 2019"
We had a great stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The upgrade to the Ali’i Tower was worth it. We enjoyed the private pool and separate check in. Everything you could need is at the hotel you never have to leave if you do not want to. ,"May 23, 2019"
"We spent the first 2 nights of our honeymoon here at HHV last summer and loved it. From all the activities, pools, beach access, central location, food options, and quality of rooms everything was superb. The staff was extremely helpful and professional. Thank you HHV for a great start to our honeymoon. We loved it so much we will be back next week. ","May 22, 2019"
"The stay was decent and way more affordable than other hotels in the area thanks to a deal we used with Hilton Honors. It is a massive hotel complex and very easy to get lost but I appreciate that The Village offered so many options for food, shopping and activities. Inside of the suite, everything ran well except our toilet ironically. The master bathroom toilet ran for about 3 days straight and the bidet never worked. Thankfully we had a 2nd bathroom to use. Overall this hotel was cool and I’d probably stay here again if I came with a parent or young kids. Otherwise, i’d probably look for something with less little/ old ones soaking up the hot tub space lol. ","May 22, 2019"
"Another amazing family vacation at HHV. Excellent for children, teens, and adults. So much to do. The beach is amazing and the pools are a great alternative for the kids. Night swimming at the Tapa pool is the kids favorite. The fact that the open airTapa bar next door has live music is nice ambiance as well. Torch lighting nightly, fireworks show on Friday night brings Everyone down to the beach. I love the shopping too. HHV is my favorite home away from home.","May 22, 2019"
"The site is perfect for any type of stay. We were afraid when we saw the flow of customers in the hotel: actually we were looking for peace and quiet for our couple holidays. We were not disappointed, there is a lot of different environment in this hotel: a little greenery where you can contemplate the parrots, restaurants, shops, others at the waterfront by the sun set and some swimming pools are forbidden to children (so very quiet).The welcome: EXTRA! We would like to thank Ceasar, Djodjo and Winnie for their concern for our comfort throughout our stay. They were always available to help us.I recommend the TAPA tower or Rainbow towers, with Waikiki beach view, also for the fireworks. Thank you to all team member to make that stay, a special stay !","May 22, 2019"
My husband and I stayed in the Kalia tower which was ok and had its own adults only pool on the 4th floor and a Starbucks in the lobby but overall the Hilton was not up to the quality we usually stay in. The bed was terrible and the grounds are just confusing and not peaceful. If you have young kids then this would probably be a good fit we are just past that point. The restaurants and shops are very convenient. The service is lacking as we were not even offered help with our bags when we checked in. This tower is furthest away from the beach.,"May 22, 2019"
As a village atmosphere it's good . It's only good till you are down in cafe restaurants and shops or beach or swimming pool area . The moment you go to your room you feel as though you are in an serviced apartment block. The quality of chattels is really bad. The bathroom needed an upgrade the doors were chipped. They had a free gift card put in the room and I was surprised that they had the cheek to even give this as a gift . For this gift one had to go to the reception and get it .Guess what it was ??? It was a sachet of tea bags which even without opening we chucked it in the bin.Overall not a great experience for the amount they charge for the room.Better stay in a appartment. ,"May 21, 2019"
"Crowded and TOO MANY KIDS!!! We are disappointed that we didn’t stay at the Royal Hawaiian our whole trip. If we go back to Hawai’i we will definitely go back there! Less crowds & kids and the hotel grounds were beautiful!!!Don’t stay at the Hilton!!!!The CONs- We arrived early, paid $50 to get a room earlier than the check in time and ended up getting a room right next to the elevators. Do not stay in the Alihi tower A-1301! It was noisy almost All night!! Especially on Friday after the fireworks. Also the room is located right above the only pool for the Alihi tower. So the kids are loud and obnoxious all day. They do not have an adults only pool, you have to go to a different Hilton down the street if you want one. It was nice but we didn’t like not having one at the hotel we were staying at. We forgot a few clothes once we left, we called them a few hours later and they claim they never saw them.....they never did find them. The PROs- there is a running track on the property, ABC stores all around, close to stuff we walked back from Diamond Head (1 hr or so but we stopped at a lot of places) and close to the Ala Moana shopping center and cruise terminal. If you stay in the Alihi tower you get a bracelet so you can skip lines for restaurants. Also it was nice to be able to see how busy the beach was and checking out a nice place to go before you go down to the beach right from your bedroom. The bathroom was nice but the tub was half the size of a normal sized tub. The fireworks were the best part but they were late and didn’t happen until around 8 o’clock","May 20, 2019"
"I am sitting in the Tapa bar area of the Hilton Hawaiian Village as I type this, waiting to catch my Uber to the airport, on my last day of a 10 day visit to the resort. The trade winds are back and the day could not be more perfect, except for the fact I’m leaving. From the moment I arrived 10Days ago, I’ve been made to feel at home by everyone here. This was a work trip/relaxation trip (on the weekends and I’ve enjoyed every second). When I arrived, the Bellman were right there to assist me with a big Aloha included. While checking in, Nancy at the front desk looked hard to find me a great room and she could not have been more pleasant. She really stood out as my favorite employee while here. The room she gave me was in the Tapa Tower on the 33rd floor, and it was an epic view. I could go on and on about the respite and the amenities and how wonderful the entire facility is, but sometimes, you just have to believe. Go and experience this tropicalParadise, as it has something for EVERYONE. TRUST ME. I can’t wait to come back and experience this property again. Dave ","May 20, 2019"
"Only stayed one night, but I would never stay here again the crowds, cover bands blaring music at all hours, a homeless man yelling obscenities at security, rust in the sinks, etc made for bad experience. I had contacted Hilton about early checkin as we were on 8:30 Qantas flight response was basically book a room for the night before. Arrived at Hilton at 10am spent 15 minutes in check in que(no one serving Honors checkin) asked about early checkin was told nothing available come back at 2. A Hilton person comes up to us and let’s us know that for $75 there might be early checkin. Sign up at early checkin desk after being told in no uncertain terms to get in line with no one else behind an unmarked velvet rope. Amazingly 5 minutes later we have a room to go to.","May 20, 2019"
"We checked in today for a 5 day vacation and I am ready to check out!!! The lack of cleanliness of this hotel has absolutelyruined my vacation and my peace of mind. I found hair in the refrigerator, the shower and all on the bathroom floor. There is also mildew/mold in the shower.My room has obviously not been cleaned thoroughly. When bringing this to managment's attention, the response was dismissive and nonchalant.Be aware that the rooms located in the Kalia are extremely outdated with furniture that is highly worn out.I am beyond embarrassed because I selected this hotel for our girls vacation and now I find myself apologizing to my friends and searching for other accommodations.Hilton, please do better.","May 19, 2019"
"My hubby and I went to this amazing place for 2 weeks. It was clean, tidy and we had the best time. Staff were fantastic, restaurants awesome. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this amazing place. ","May 19, 2019"
"The perfect place to escape to. Everything you could possibly need is in one place. You never need to leave the resort. But, it is walking distance to downtown and the Ala Moana mall. It also has the widest stretch on beach.","May 19, 2019"
"We cruise to Hawaii each year and we always stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village for about a week before flying home to Australia. This place is so large, it covers dozens of acres, there are hundreds of shops on site and several restaurants providing a range of options from quick eats through to fine dining. The complex contains 5 or 6 different towers, each with their own facilities and of course their associated costs. We always stay in the Ali'i Tower, which is right on the beach and has it's own check-in desk within the tower. Highly recommended.","May 19, 2019"
"EVERYTHING here costs except the pools & iced water! (not bottled). Before you start the day you have already been charged $45+taxes resort fee, we have no idea what for!We weren’t offered any help with our luggage when we checked in, just pointed in the direction of where to go! Also after a long flight and another hour to get here from the airport there is no Welcome drink offered as with most other resorts!Every shop & restaurant in the village is here to rip you off - so try and go elsewhere for meals and everything else (although the city is certainly not cheap)!If you are tossing up between here and other South Pacific islands put this one at the bottom of your list, your money will go further and you’ll have a much better holiday!","May 18, 2019"
"My fiancé and I stayed here for 6 nights. Even though it is a beautiful spot, the extra payments that we had to pay like the $45 a day hotel fee and $45 a day parking fee had me quite frustrated at the fact I was loosing so much money already and we'd just arrived.","May 17, 2019"
"Too crowded - the beach is kind of dirty - they really push you so spend more and you'll have to if you want to check in early ($50) - park ($45) upgrade your room - $$$$We had a room in the Diamond Head Tower - yuck - our sink was rusty so we requested another room - they were right on it and moved up two floors to a room still worn with chipped furniture, worn carpet and a rusty sink! If you want a nice room, spend more and get in another tower!If you want to shop, the location is fine but I was looking for a genuine Hawaiian experience and to see the beauty of the island, not Hilton's idea of Disney World.","May 16, 2019"
"Stayed for 3 nights, took 1.5 hr to check-in, as other reviews state this is normal, and open air with no A/C, nowhere to sit. Staff very slow and not enough of them, my husband did ask about this and you can be checked in without a wait for $57.00!, Resort charge is normal for Pacific islands, but this is very expensive @ $40 + tax per day. The hotel is vast, very impersonal, entirely unsuitable for anyone other than large groups or families who want to party or never want to leave the resort and don’t mind spending large amounts of money on substandard food and services. Rooms are dated, very 70’s, but not in a hipster way, but are comfortable and huge. We were lucky and had a nice quiet room, however, if there had been any issues with the room e.g noise the staff obviously wouldn’t do anything to help. We spent our time trying to get away from the hotel, location is not convenient for the central area of Waikiki. Very expensive for what it was, overcrowded pools at all times of day and night! Cattle class hotel! Avoid, there are far nicer, smaller hotels which are much cheaper, with much better staff.","May 15, 2019"
"The hotel is monstrous which adds to the average commercialized person's appeal. Sadly, it has terrible food at the restaurants with sub par service at the Tapa Bar. The rooms are quite average, like staying at a Holiday Inn. The bed was comfortable, however I didn't find the cleanliness of the rooms that great. I attended Yoga on the grassy knoll twice while here, a nice perk to staying there and the instructor was excellent. The views and the fact that it is a in a prime beach front property location is the only appeal to this hotel. Spending the amount of money we did to stay here to me was just simply not worth it. Especially given that the beach is not owned by any of the beachfront hotel properties in Waikiki, so essentially it doesn't really matter. There are quite a bit of disgruntled staff at this resort. Speaks to their employer...The views from our rooms were amazing...Again, due to the sheer location of this property is the only positive thing about it. I would say if you are the type of traveler who enjoys high commercialization, this is the hotel for you. If not, steer clear.","May 14, 2019"
I just wanted to thank David and Scott (in management) for their amazing and quick customer service.Thank you for the wonderful accomodations at Rainbow Tower!Tips: Blue Water Shrimp restaurant has excellent food.Uber has designated pick up area - behind Diamond Head Tower.,"May 14, 2019"
I can’t recommend the Hilton in Honolulu any more it is absolutely amazing fabulous people are so friendly the resort was just perfect clean had everything you could possibly need it is amazing it is a must do can’t wait to go back . I give it out of 10 . I’m in love with this place ☺️,"May 13, 2019"
We love the hotel as long as there is not a big group for a convention staying in the hotel. We made reservations almost 1 year in advance and made a note it was our 20th anniversary. By checking in the hotel it took us 1 1/2 hour to get our room and in the end they only could offer us a double bed......on our anniversary :( I think the hotel is great as long there is no big group staying for conventions ,"May 13, 2019"
the service provided in this hotel was of the poorest quality. continual requests for assistance were dismissed and general advice was answered by trying to pass me from one person to another.The check in process was dreadful with lines of 2 hours and staff being dismissive of my concerns that i had 2 persons with special needs appalling situation,"May 12, 2019"
"I liked the property overall although it is very big and required a lot of walking(which is only an issue when combined with drinking). Every single staff member I encountered was excellent. My room was a little worn but not too bad. Everything was clean and comfortable. The beach is OK. Waikiki beaches don't compare with the other side of the island in my opinion. There are many options for eating and drinking on grounds.Parking is way too pricey at $45 a day. Lots of families with kids which is also a big detraction. Location is great, lots to walk to including the mall. Take comfortable shoes and walk.","May 10, 2019"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort is one of the WORST Hotels we have ever stayed in and we have stayed in resorts all around the world! As soon as we arrived we were dumped on the end of a long, long queue filled with angry, impatient customers. The Hotel Lobby was a nightmare, understaffed and the front desk staff were rude and impatient. We booked on-line for a certain cost and when we got to the desk, we found out that we were going to be charged more than $45 per person per day cost for a rip-off Resort Fee to use facilities that we had no intention of using! We have never had to pay this Resort Fee anywhere else in the world so we were not happy and grateful that we only had to stay in this awful place for one day! The only thing worse than this so-called Resort is Honolulu Airport - what pure chaos! So glad to get away from Oahu and Hawaii - there are far better places to go!","May 9, 2019"
"We stayed for 8 nights & enjoyed the hotel once we got used to the sheer size and number of guests. We had never stayed in a place so big but in saying this after a few days we got used to it and all of the amenities it had to offer. The convenience of a number of restaurants, bars, cafes, ice cream parlour on site as well as the ABC Stores was absolutely fantastic. Would highly recommend the Luau, good value, good quality food & entertainment great. We were allocated a Diamond Tower room, it was well maintained at all times, housekeeping staff very friendly and was nice to have a balcony even with a partial sea view. The only negative as such for us was the highly expensive rental fees for paddle boards, umbrella's etc to use on the beach & lagoon. Hence we didn't visit the beach at the hotel & strolled the short & comfortable walk to Waikikki for some waves & more reasonably priced equipment hire. We liked the hotel, however if we ever returned would probably not stay again and would go closer to Waikikki. Great for families though with all the conveniences at your finger tips.","May 7, 2019"
"This is a massive resort. It’s long overdue for money to be spent on it. Presently there is drilling going on all day on one of the towers. This will continue till September. It’s noisy and if you are poolside very disruptive. We were told it happens on Mondays and Tuesdays. We have been to Hawaii many times. The staff in this hotel are not as good as other places we have stayed. They are not naturally friendly, interested or engaged. It’s clearly a numbers game - you are one of thousands and that’s how they treat you. The state of our room was appalling to say the least. Door that didn’t close, lights not working, chairs almost broken to say just a few things. Sofa looks 20 years old. Curtains are yellow. Paint is peeling off the doors. Clearly this is a hotel that brings in lots of money but the money doesn’t go back into it. Resort fee alone would bring them in around $200k a night when the hotel is full. For those who aren’t too particular it’s a good option. The noise is a problem for me, the state of the rooms is a problem in some towers. There are a lot of groups here which can also be a bit annoying and you feel overrun. If you do make a complaint or pass on feedback it’s just met with we will pass it on. Hilton should be better at this - they are one of the biggest hotel companies and they should have more respect for their guests than to let people book rooms in this state and listen to deafening noise on a hard earned expensive holiday. You’ve got to wonder who is in charge here?","May 7, 2019"
Highly recommend staying at this amazing resort!Has everything you need in the incredible village - It has everything you need right at your door stop - and only a short a short walk away is the main hustle and bustle of Waikiki.Highly recommend staying at this resort for a place to escape and feel relaxed.Rooms are great and comfortable too. Perfect for families or couples! It accommodates everyone.,"May 7, 2019"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village hasn't lost any of its charm. It's a beautiful oasis in the middle of paradise, if you believe it. It's not perfect, but its flaws are easily overlooked because of the natural beauty and relaxation you can find there.They don't play by the usual Hilton rules, so even at the highest HHonors level, you'll see no room upgrades, no late checkout, nor will you be entitled to the free breakfast that you get at all other Hilton properties (they give you a daily $10 credit instead - which is total b.s.).Prices are on par with the rest of Waikiki, and the property offers many things to do. The staff is fairly friendly and helpful, but you should check your bill on the way out because they sometimes add charges that don't apply to you. For me, it was a daily $59 valet parking charge, even though we didn't have a car. The desk clerk easily removed the charge and was apologetic, but I somehow think this is a calculated semi-scam on Hilton's part. Overall, beautiful property, pretty good staff, some slipshod practices, LONG lines at the Starbucks every morning, and a painfully slow check-in process. With all that, I'll be back because the positives outweighed the negatives.","May 7, 2019"
"Upgraded to the Ali'i tower. Really nice rooms. Comfortable beds, Good maid service. Front desk awesome. Good partial beach view from the room. Nice and quiet. Close to everything and walking distance to pretty much everything.","May 7, 2019"
"We down a wonder two weeks for my birthday in this wonderful oasis in the middle of a large metropolitan city. Our accommodations were nice and clean, the views spectacular and the service was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed it so much I came back a month later with friends!!","May 7, 2019"
"The location of this property is unbeatable. And the service was nice. The rooms seem a little outdated and could use updating. Overall, this property offers great activities for guests and is very family-friendly. Probably not the best place for couples looking for a quiet and/or romantic getaway. This property also makes you feel like you never want to leave the grounds because there's so much to do onsite, but Hawaii is so beautiful, so make sure to adventure out!","May 7, 2019"
We have been timeshare members for years. The maintenance of the units has become sloppy. The parking lot is hard to find good parking in after you pay $45/ day to park. The location is great and access to the beach is beautiful.,"May 7, 2019"
"About the most amazing vacation you can ever take. Everything was absolutely perfect. The rooms, food, entertainment. I would suggest staying here to anyone. Several pools, places to eat, walking distance to everything.","May 7, 2019"
Our stay was for three days prior to cruise around the islands. Did same thing in 2015 staying here each time. Overall experience was very good. Very expensive places on the property. One hamburger was $25. One pizza was $30.two non-alcohol drinks at pool $20. Room and view were great. Registration staff a little slow. Staff friendly and helpful. Might try a different hotel next time.,"May 7, 2019"
The registration staff is slow at best and appears to work at one speed and that is slow without adding staff as needed. Signage on this location for diamond head building is unbelievably poor with no signage to where to find the elevators on this building as they are well hidden at best in unlabeled out of the way places. Prices on most meals is double or triple what the eating places are across the street in the food court or a block or two over.,"May 6, 2019"
"I’ve been coming here since the 70’s. I’ve scene the unbelievable transition over the years. Iv’e lost track at how many towers they now have on the property. At least 8. To me it’s the best location of all Hotels in Honolulu. Close to everything...the mall restaurants, shopping etc.As far as accommodations, I have 2 favorites. My first choice is the Alii tower. Best rooms are “05” rooms. These are corner rooms with much larger space and wrap around balconies. The most romantic room on the entire property! The staff at the Alii tower is as good as it gets in Hawaii. There is also their second floor which also offers a more private pool, best lounge chairs ,umbrellas and great service for food and drink. The maid service is impeccable and most accommodating. If I travel with my extended family, I opt for on of the many 1 or 2 bedroom timeshare units available to rent. Fireworks every Friday night ...and very romantic. Only down side is their restaurants. They are a disappointment for the size of the property when it comes to value for the money. On other posts of mine I will give you several great Honolulu restaurant reviews. Aloha!","May 5, 2019"
"We made our first trip to Hawaii in February thru AAA. This hotel was our room accommodations. It more than met our needs. 7 buildings with about 10,000 rooms right on the beach. Private lagoon, outdoor ""on the lawn"" movie nights on Saturdays. A beachfront fireworks display each weekend, too. Numerous shops and restaurants from $ to $$$$ to meet the financial needs of all travelers. Enjoyed our stay very much.","May 5, 2019"
"Firstly I will start with the positives... the room was clean and comfortable, the view was amazing and the food was pretty nice when we did eat there even though you can get better at a better price if you walk a little bit further down the road. Now as for the rest, we were aware that we would be up for some taxes when we arrived but seeing how we had just stayed the previous week in Maui (which is supposed to be more expensive than Oahu) when we checked in we were also notified that it would also be $45 US a day for parking so with taxes and parking it cost us another $750 Aus on top of the couple of grand we had already paid when booking 12mths prior and when compared to Maui which was a much nicer condo style apartment we only paid an extra $250 Aus. Now just to add to our check in frustrations the attendant actually said I will have to see what we have available and we were quite shocked considering we had booked so far in advance, then he asked “seeing how it’s your honeymoon I would highly recommend you upgrade to the rainbow tower as it has been newly renovated and that would be another $45 US a day”. Now I don’t know how they handle honeymoons in Honolulu normally and I do realise that they would get a large percentage of people coming there for this reason but when in Maui we were well looked after and people moved mountains to give you that extra special care and attention but at the Hilton Hawaiian they just saw it as as another chance to get more cash out of you and I honestly would have thought that an upgrade here or there would haven’t been too much trouble. After my wife politely telling them no thanks, we then asked where the parking was and was told where to go and after finally finding a park we had to haul our luggage about 600m to get to our tower and room!! To say we were less than impressed with the service provided by the Hilton staff at the front desk and there crazy parking prices for hotel guests would be an understatement and we would definitely recommend not staying here considering there are much nicer hotels in the same area where parking was a lot cheaper.We will not be back to the Hilton Hawaiian and my parents had planned on visiting this year also and we have also told them to look elsewhere.","May 5, 2019"
"My wife and I started here at the Hilton before the start of our NCL cruise. We were here for two days (NCL paid for one day). It can be pricey here but location and amenities gives it its value. We like the fireworks on Friday night, though they could be a little longer.","May 5, 2019"
"I have to say I was nervous booking here given the mixed reviews, but after my stay, I can't really see what all the fuss is about. Everything from location to cleanliness was perfect. Staff was attentive and friendly, rooms were very clean, and the grounds/pools had a lot to offer. Despite a lot of people, it never really felt very crowded (except on Friday for the Fireworks). WiFi was excellent, even at the beach. I had a partial Ocean View and it was nearly perfect. A few minor complaints:1. The dresser drawers were a bit beat up and wouldn't open or close properly. My getting stuff in and out wasn't an issue, but for the price of a nights stay, a dresser shouldn't have this issue. 2. Parking is extremely high. I get it, parking is a premium, but given the resort fee and the nightly cost, this part of the trip could be lower.3. Resort fee. I hate them, everyone hates them, but they're becoming more and more common, so I get it. I also understand I have a choice -- but even so $45 per night is a bit high considering it doesn't really provide much more than other resorts would.Overall, I was impressed more so than I thought I would be with this property and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.","May 5, 2019"
"We have stayed at this location before and it won't be the last time. We find the Hilton to be very central to everything and the staff are always friendly and obliging. We stayed in the Ali'i Towers again and if you prefer a little bit of privacy and seclusion away from the hustle and bustle, then this is a good choice. Access to a private pool, gym and various other amenities as well as a seperate check in desk makes this a great choice in our opinion. We opted for an Ocean view room and the views were stunning. The room was quite large, well appointed, and quiet.","May 4, 2019"
"Spent 3 nights here and am very impressed. Didn’t make use of the restaurants or bars at the hotel (and there are heaps) but the grounds and the lagoon area is magic. The water was lovely and great to sit by and cool off in. Most of the beaches in the immediate Waikiki area aren’t all that amazing (in my opinion) but the lagoon is spot on. Especially if you were traveling with kids. Location wise, it’s on the extremity of the downtown Waikiki area, but it’s about an 8 to 10 min walk and you’re right in the mix. Definitely worth a look. ","May 4, 2019"
Hilton Hawaiian Village is the location on Waikiki to stay at. It's self contained little oasis and I can't wait to return with my family. From check-in to check-out it was perfect. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. We love the sea turtle snorkeling excursion that's offered right at the hotel. So convenient! Just walk to the dock and board a boat and they take you out not too far from Waikiki with crystal clear water. We saw so many beautiful sea turtles! We love that there's so many ABC stores on property. Can't wait to return!,"May 4, 2019"
The resort is fantastic and lots to do. Overall very clean We stayed in the Tapa tower family room The room needs updating The couch is super old and ratty. Needs to be replaced. For what they charge it would be easy to do! The carpet is old too. But you’re not in the room that much. Just found it really weird.,"May 4, 2019"
"Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and surrounding facilities. The staff was very helpful and willing to go the extra mile. Food was good, a bit pricey, but I guess the location is worth it. Plenty of things to do and walking to attractions is possible. ","May 4, 2019"
"There are everything at Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort for you to shop at ABC Stores, lot of good food for dinner at restaurants and bar with live music, coffee, ice cream shops. The location is great and so convenient specially we can enjoy fireworks on every Friday night","May 4, 2019"
This resort is pretty spectacular. We had just an overnight after coming off a 12 day cruise and this place left us wishing we had booked a longer stay. Our room was delightful with two balconies which allowed the ocean breeze to flow through. Check-in was easy. We arrived early in the morning and opted to pay a fee for early check-in and it was well worth it. We were settled in and off to hike Diamond Head before 10AM. Many food options on site and the food was very good. Loved the location and we'd definitely consider staying there again if we find ourselves back in Honolulu.,"May 3, 2019"
This hotel is amazing!!!! The amenities are super.l and there are lots of things to do and see around the hotel complex. We are in the tower and have an ocean view. Wow! Fireworks on Friday night with a front row seat. Well worth the $$$$.,"May 2, 2019"
Han made our stay personable and provided extra needs such as kuerig cups and towels. She was attentive to our stay and made an effort to greet us in the morning as we left for activities. She is a great ambassador for Hilton.,"May 2, 2019"
I've been coming here for nearly 20 years every year and this has deteriorated in terms of care. There were wonderful shows at the pool. As a Diamond I expect complimentary breakfasts or the equivalent not a ridiculous amount which is far less than the cost of any meal . Value is problematic for Diamond's.,"May 2, 2019"
"On April 27th 2019 myself, my wife and our Granddaughter were dropped off at your Hotel immediately following our Arizona Memorial Tour after departing our NCL Hawaii 7 day cruise. Our travel agent had booked Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort for our overnight stay. Our cruise director thought this was your establishment so we were dropped off there. I want to bring to your attention the superior service we received from your standout employee Ms. Ginger Dillman. She was so very kind and caring. We were treated like VIP's. Ms. Dillman quickly put our fears and concerns to rest. She immediately focused on our needs and truly cared about our well being. Ginger called the Hilton Waikiki Beach Resort to confirm we were booked at that hotel. She then followed up by calling Charlie's Taxi and arranged to have us transported to that hotel. We were overwhelmed and so impressed she had given us a voucher to cover the cost of the taxi. All this for 3 Canadian Tourists who were not even staying at your Hotel. This is an excellent example of going well above and beyond all expectations. We have the pleasure of being world travellers in our retirement and this was, by far, the best care and attention we have ever received. Our highest praise goes to Ms. Ginger Dillman and our sincere appreciation and thanks to both Ginger and your incredible Hotel. Please pass along our great appreciation and admiration and thank you so much for such superior service. You can be assured we will be staying at your establishment if we return to Honolulu in the future. We will also share this story with our friends. Thank you, thank you. You are simply THE BEST!","May 2, 2019"
"This was a 16th birthday gift to my granddaughter. I wanted her to experience the fun of Waikiki while staying in an upscale resort after flying first class. Her experiences were very positive. When relaxing on the beach or by the pool there were lots of texts between friends in Seattle and her. Comically, many included green memes from her friends :)","April 30, 2019"
"I booked this via Costco Travel, having spent six nights on Kauai I wanted a different taste of Hawaii. Well, Oahu is definitely different than Kauai! Hello big city!!I did not rent a car here. I did manage to walk 10 miles around the city seeing the zoo, aquarium, and making a stop at Leonard’s for malasadas (I liked the custard filled ones the best). One fun thing I noticed was Oahu was about 60% Asian tourists. This midwestern girl got a kick out of the attire and selfie sticks! Positives:It’s a Hilton. You know what to expect: comfy beds, a solid TV, a decent sized bathroom. The shower was pretty nice, steady temps considering I was on the 25th floor. Plenty of towels. The shampoo/conditioner/lotion was one of the best smelling I’ve come across (and I travel for business quite a bit). No issues getting an elevator quickly. (This was very Vegas-like to me) I was in the Kailia (sp?) Tower, so buildings closer to the beach may have busier elevators. Nice to have a fridge! Lots of shopping and restaurants on site, you really don’t have to leave the premises (Vegas style). Honolulu Cookie Co! Free Samples people! I ended up buying quite a few tins as gifts for my family. They freeze for up to six months, so I’ll freeze my box next to the Girl Scout Cookies I bought earlier this year. The ABC stores are great for whatever....the Walgreens/CVS of Hawaii. Negatives:If you request an ‘Ocean facing room’ it is definitely NOT an ocean front room. Don’t spend the extra on the four foot ‘balcony’ with generic patio furniture. You can’t see past the bars and the sunset is blocked by the other buildings. I could technically see the ocean, from about half a mile away. AC unit only went to 68 degrees. I got fairly warm at night. No ceiling fan to help circulate the air and the fan wouldn’t change modes. I wanted to book a tour of Pearl Harbor. However I didn’t have a concierge in my tower. When I called I got pricing and two different offerings, I wanted to research them on the Internet before committing. When I called back 10 minutes later, it went to voicemail. I left my details for a return call and never received one. I wanted a late checkout. After three voicemails to the front desk, I pressed ‘0’ somewhere along the way and got a person who could approve it. For a resort with people coming and going at all hours, I expected better availability. Overall, it wasn’t worth the splurge.","April 30, 2019"
"This hotel is very, very large. Something like 3200 rooms on 22 acres. Multiple towers throughout the property with many stores, shops and eating establishments. Right on Waikiki Beach with it's own private lagoon. Also close to the pier which takes you on the Submarine tour. Five minute fireworks every Friday. Many pools, music throughout the day at various bars. Pricey but this is Hawaii (everything is expensive). Walking with a cane can be very tiring as the walking areas consist of various materials (flagstone, brick,coblestone etc) Nice feature is the electric vehicles that you can request to get from here to there, free but tipping is accepted. These are nice as mentioned before walking could be hard for some as some places you may want to go are quite a distance. All excursions seem to leave from the same general area which could be quite far from where you begin. The only place that seemed crowded were the ABC stores. This is where we bought the following days breakfast as our tours started fairly early and it was easier to eat in the rooms. Needless to say you could also walk or taxi to many off property places in Honolulu.","April 30, 2019"
"Spent two weeks in Waikiki at the Village. The room was typical Hilton room with a killer view (we opted for ocean view). No microwave which was a disappointment but there was a fridge and coffee maker and the other usuals. Service folks were incredibly friendly and helpful. Warning: nothing in the village is cheap. The resort has several restaurants - our favorite was Hatsuhana, a Japanese restaurant. Great live music every night. Great shopping opportunities in the village but watch out for hard sell. This was the one thing I disliked about the resort - some places were over priced and used pressure sell tactics. Totally awesome beach and the Mandara spa is definitely worth a visit. Perk to the spa visit is the adult only pool area. The other Pools and lagoon are great for kids.Several activities associated with the hotel - the Luau, the submarine Atlantis, turtle canyon, catamaran sail... and several others easily available by shuttle that picks you up at the resort. Trolley and buses stop at Village too. It’s in the heart of Waikiki and there are lots of restaurants and shopping near by","April 30, 2019"
This was not a good use of your money. Told that the doors were opening at 4:30 but it didn’t happen until five. Photos were $50. You didn’t get a lei unless you paid $30 extra. The food was not hot. Free drink was watered down and the price of a second drink was very high. Having a luau inside was a building was awful.,"April 30, 2019"
"It is a large resort, but easy to access everything. They have two ABC stores for anything you need (groceries/alcohol/toiletries/souvenirs). All the pools were great and water is cold at first, but not terrible. Our daughter loved the slides and tapa pool. Loved the option of walking to the pool, ocean, or lagoon. Prices for rentals (chairs/umbrellas/paddle board/etc) were insane! We just packed a beach blanket and settled for shade under the palm tree. We stayed at the tapa tower with a resort view and had a little view of the ocean. Even if we didn’t get a grand view, it was still a great spot since it was close to everything and we barely spent time in the room. Though we asked for a king bed we were given a room with double beds and were offered the Ali’i tower for extra and a early check in for extra as well. Got to the fireworks show 5 min before it started and still got a great view. Tons and tons of international tourists, conventions, and vacationers, but not an inconvenience. I loved how they had so many people to help translate for others as well. We opted out of eating anything at the resort, but the happy hours and drinks are great.Some negatives: our daughter got a scratch on her face from one of the pillows guessing it was the zipper. Bathtub had horrible drainage and our key for the parking garage didn’t work the first two days, but workers always came instantly to help.Overall it was a great experience. People usually go to spend their whole vacation at the resort, which is fine, but there’s so much more to do in Oahu. The resort does offer everything for all ages. It was a great home base and accessible to everything. Note that it is at the end of all the hotels, but less than 10 minute walk to all the madness of Waikiki.Thanks for the great and memorable stay Hilton! ","April 29, 2019"
"The Rooms are clean except the balconies, staff are pleasant, the live music was very nice every night, lots of activities for families, and couples. Good food but the prices are high on most everything. ","April 29, 2019"
"Will... If you want to be here you should not think about money at all, yes its expenses. But it's fun place to be, inside pools and a big laguna, A lot of activities to do, name it you find it.ABC stores are everywhere to purchase what ever you want.Rooms are good, i stayed in the Tapa Tower which was great. The gym is in a different tower which i found strange and annoying. Avoid Tapa bar... The drinks prices are ridiculously expensive and the service is bad. They are hiring old age staff which are grumpy . ","April 29, 2019"
"We were so excited when we got our room , we unpacked, went out for a swim and came back to see a tick crawling around on the bed!!! I moved it to the dresser and smashed it with a piece of paper and it gushed blood. So needless to say my husband went down to complain. because we couldnt get the front desk on the phone. We were able to change rooms 11 floors below ours and were given breakfast vouchers! That's it!!! We were told our new room would have the crib we requested and of course after we got back from dinner...no crib! For the amount I paid to stay in a suite I regret my decision to stay here. Also there needs to be more attention to detail such as our rooms lamp shade was completely busted! ","April 28, 2019"
"The suite is big enough to fit family of six (kids ages 11, 10, 5, 3). The location of rainbow tower is great as it is right next to the beach and lagoon, and our whole family had a relaxing time there. Beautiful sunset can be viewed from the beach, as well as from the balcony. Special thanks to hotel manager Mumi Matagulay for helping with hotel arrangements for our birthday boy. It makes out first visit to Hawaii special and memorable. We look forward to visiting again!","April 28, 2019"
"Large resort. Over 20 acres? Hotels, shopping, restaurants all right on the beach. Great place to stay. Several hotels or vacation condos. Wonderful location. Right in Honolulu. Many options for transportation around the island. Recommend Charlie's taxi to travel to and from the airport. Flat $29 fee for the two of us. ","April 28, 2019"
Absolutely LOVED this hotel and everything about it. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The grounds were super clean and the food and shopping was excellent. Great variety of everything at the hotel. We upgraded to the Ali'i Tower and it was worth it - your own pool and bar and perfect location to watch the Friday night fireworks show. This really was the perfect hotel and it's only a 15-20 minute walk to downtown. The breakfast at Tropics is huge - the pancakes are delicious - I could barely finish them. We will be back and this is where we will definitely stay again!!!,"April 28, 2019"
"My husband was here for work, which put us up at the Sheraton and then the Hilton. We got upgrades in both hotels but I much prefer the Sheraton, for very idiosyncratic reasons.We were upgraded to the Rainbow tower - supposedly the best, but:1. The water pressure was awful.2. The lobby is a maze.3. There is a hard sell (buy this! updgrade that!) that screams of desperation. The staff member who checked us in told us there was a kettle in our room, after overselling us, and there wasn't.4. The chest of drawers in our room would not close fully, causing a trip hazard.5. It is very, very busy: just like the Sheraton Waikiki, but less well designed and felt more crowded and less well organised.6. Yoga classes at the ungodly hour of 6!7. Terrible TV channels and no interesting shows to watch. Not good if you want to chill after a long day of travel/ work.8. I personally preferred the location at the Shearton: so much closer to Waikiki beach and the action than the Hilton.9. Wifi was very unreliable and cut out all the time.Tl;DR - if you're an internet savvy guest who is practical, likes an excellent view and great service, stay at the Shearton (instead of at the Hilton).","April 28, 2019"
"First off, I wanted to thank Pam at front desk for her kindness and patience. She really helped me, my son & wild grandchildren have a more relaxing time. I've been to Oahu many times and only came here to watch the fireworks, so I decided to treat my grandbabies to 1 day here after a crazy week of unpacking for their move. Loved all the different pools and lagoons. Food can be pricey, great happy hour at tapa bar, got cheap breakfast at the Hatsuhana restaurant for 10.00, CJs & abc store for misc snacks. Expect to spend at least a 100 for food. We didnt leave the resort area. thanks again pam","April 27, 2019"
"My Wife and I stayed at the Hilton Beach Resort, Waikiki in April 2019. What a great time we had. This resort has it all. A beautiful setting along the Pacific Ocean. Beautiful pools that are kept in pristine conditions. Wonderful Hotel workers, who are always willing to help you out. The rooms in the Rainbow Tower are big and comfortable. The rooms have a refrigerator that you’re welcome to use. The views from all of the rooms are incredible. Renting a surfboard or paddle board is a simple process. Start out practicing in the man maid lagoon. Get some ice cream at Dairy Queen. Visit one of the many retail shops on property. Fireworks every Friday night. Definitely check out this Resort when visiting Waikiki ","April 27, 2019"
"We stayed 3 nights here and overall it was ""okay."" On the plus side, it has a wide variety of shops and restaurants on the property with everything you could possibly need. Seems great for families. It is also has some great views of Waikiki beach depending on your room. There are multiple pools, a saltwater lagoon, and of course a beach. And, the staff we interacted with were all very friendly and helpful.On the negative side, it may be too large for some. It is a huge place. Parking is pricey ($45/day for self-parking) and there is a pricey $45/day resort fee too. While there were multiple pools, none were particularly large. And, there are a lot of people everywhere. We only ate at one of the restaurants, the Tropics Bar & Grill, for brunch Easter morning. For $29, we expected much more. They had an omelette station, which had long waits. Otherwise, they only had a very basic selection---so-so scrambled eggs, pancakes, mushy potatoes that were not even hot, and a few other items you would find for free at a typical 2 or 3-star motel or hotel. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower and had a great view from our ocean-front room on the 12th floor. The room itself though was very ""meh"" with beige on beige on beige decor that also had a fair amount of wear and tear beginning to show. The lighting was bright but not very warm. The room was a bit of a let-down. It sounded as if they were renovating other rooms in the tower though because we heard a lot of drilling noise during the daytime. Maybe the recently renovated rooms are nicer.All-in-all, the hotel was ""okay"" but not sure if it was worth the high price.","April 27, 2019"
"The rooms are nice the beach views are nice and the fireworks tonight were nice. The problem? Wall to wall people and cars. It’s way to crowded for my liking. The prices are through the roof. 1 scoop of Ice cream in a waffle cone was $8.00!! And it was exactly 1 scoop. $52.00 valet parking, I’m diamond and they refused to give me water the second day. Stay somewhere else.","April 27, 2019"
"My room was on Tapa Tower and it was screaming for a renovation, it felt like traveling in time to the 70's with worn out bathroom and furniture. It really didn't justify the steep price, even with the great location. Everything else in the hotel was good, but the room was really underwhelming. (I got the Ocean View with King bed, but even so...)","April 25, 2019"
"Stayed in Rainbow Tower, 7th floor overlooking Lagoon. Pools were great, but lounge chairs fill up quickly. Friday night fireworks were excellent. We ate at Round Table Pizza, and enjoyed Dairy Queen both located on property.","April 25, 2019"
"We recently stayed for 4 nights in the Rainbow Tower. It was great! We found the room very clean with an excellent view of the lagoon and ocean. I also loved the magnifying mirror in the bathroom. Very nice.Although we loved the Hilton, I was disappointed you had to pay to rent a beach chair or paddle boats and tricycles in the lagoon. Maybe that’s the norm but it was really expensive for just using it for an hour. Overall we had a great time. I’d recommend this hotel to families and couples. ","April 25, 2019"
"So bummed that the two nights we stayed here were lame. We had a daughter in a cast unexpectedly- and not one single staff member had ever asked if we needed anything. Bar staff were complaining about lack of bartenders... wait for food everywhere. It took us over an hour to check in as Hilton honors members- too bad we weren't diamond club. Our room was very loud ith people above ""moving furniture"" until about 12:30am each night- Jr suite rainbow tower- and the room was handily converted from 2 hotel rooms so we had plenty of space but 2 a/c units and 2 balconies- some shotty craftsmanship. Our ""King"" bed was no bigger - and maybe smaller than the queen our daughter sleeps in at home. We couldn't go far because of the leg cast and never got beach chairs because the line was so long in the morning they were sold out by the time it was ""our turn"". Best food - CJ's for take out dinner and breakfast! Even the ukulele store in Kalia tower shunned us coming in with crutches. My daughter plays ukulele and would we would have happily invested in another one except the worker said ""you can only hold if you buy"". Not the Hilton hospitality I have come to know for sure. Each time we asked for something we were told to ask someone else. Will not return EVER- so disappointing.","April 24, 2019"
"We stayed at the rainbow Rainbow Tower Oceanfront Room for 4 nights. The view was simply amazing. It was to the point where we did not even have to step out to experience Waikiki beach. An experience like no other and perfect for vacation. However, the part that did not meet our standards other than the elevator was the bed. It was my first time visiting Hawaii so I might be late in mentioning this but the queen bed was too small for us. We had three people in the same room and we just had to rent another bed which costed us $75 extra per night. Eventually we ended paying $682.60 for parking ($45 per day), resort fee ($45 per day) and the extra bed ($75 per day) along with taxes. I would have liked it if the bed was bigger. That is my only complaint. If you would like to suggest other hotels with bigger beds, then let me know. I will probably go back to visit again.","April 24, 2019"
"Multiple towers, slick operation. Check in seamless despite the crowd. Clean and you get the minimum of what you expect. I believe Resort Fees are inherently dishonest, but that doesn’t just apply to Hilton. You don’t get what you should for this extra cash. ","April 24, 2019"
"We recently returned from a week in the rainbow tower. The good things first - the room was sensational with the best view we have had on Waikiki. It was great to see the turtles swimming and for the fireworks. The staff were great.My issue was all of the extras:- 2 beach chairs and an umbrella were $70 per day (no half day rates); kids club was $110; resort fee was $45 (and am not sure what you got other than wifi); 2 hairbraids were $40 etc etc. Breakfast was also prohibitive. I think for value, I will look elsewhere next time. I dont mind paying but object to the blatant rip off.","April 24, 2019"
"Aloha Just been on Vacation here for 10 days!The travel from the UK is a proper long haul, but have to say 100% worth the Paradise island, that awaits you! The walk to downtown Waikiki is literally 5 mins a long the beach and 5 mins through a couple of streets and your there! Just note that there is a new Resort Fee which will be taken as soon as you arrive, $45 per day could eat away at to holiday fund if you aren’t expecting it. Also the incidentals are taken at the same time and $600 is by far the most expensive I’ve ever put down, although you get this back at the end of your holiday, yet again if you weren’t expecting it, could eat away at your budget!The Hilton Hawaiian village complex, has all you need for your vacation, however if you are like my family and I and like to explore, Downtown Waikiki is not far and the array of shopping centres with food courts, will save you at least %50 on pizza etc!Ala Moana centre is also in walking distance and has everything a person (woman) Needs under one roof! 3 levels of a mixture of High end and high street shops, you are bound to seek a bargain or 2. After walking around here you’ll probably need a bite to eat and the food court cater for most. I went for the Charley’s Philli, their chicken and loaded fries was a welcomed treat!There are plenty of day trips out, out and if you can use computer/smart phone you can save 10% by booking online, if you are a serving member of the military or veteran add an extra %20 saving!We have fallen in love with Waikiki and will definitely be returning in the near future, however as we have stayed in the Hilton Hawaiian Village now, so next time we’ll probably try somewhere else.Paradise island it truly was...The Aloha spirt awaits my return Aloha x","April 24, 2019"
We stayed in the Rainbow Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki beach on the 30th floor. Our view was amazing!!! The hotel was somewhat dated but very clean. Our bathroom was much smaller than we are used to but we were not in the room much. The resort was very nice but the restaurants were over the top pricey. We tried to walk to other places in the evenings. Everyone that worked there were top notch and friendly. No problems with room service or any employees. Beautiful place to stay.,"April 23, 2019"
This hotel was great. Has an indoor pool and offer FREE breakfast and a BUFFET at night which was also free. The room was great we had our own room with my daughter on the sofa bed in another room. The hotel was dog friendly. We brought our dog Olive. The staff was excellent and was not expensive. I recommend the Drury hotel chain. They are brand new some of them are not even built yet so check each state. Great family hotel!,"April 23, 2019"
"I arrived @ 0930hpm at the Hotel. No one helped us w/ the luggage and no single room w/ a king size bed was available. To be fair I booked a twin bed room. Once we arrived at the room, we were surprised in a bad way. The room was very old and run down, but the two Bad surprises just to come. The bathroom was not cleaned in a way you would expect from such hotel. There were hairs in the bath tube and the seat of the toilet bowl was dirty. If you think it cannot get any worse, pls see attached picture of a clipped toe nail.Hotel gave us voucher for the full breakfast buffet was nice. Pls note that I was the 1st time in the early 90s in the Hotel, where it was sth very special. I came back in 2003 where it was still Ok, coming back now and I realizing what happened made me very sad. What a horrible start of our honeymoon! ","April 23, 2019"
"We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and had a great time! The property is like a mini city, and there are so many shops and restaurants there. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower and had a great view of Waikiki beach from our room. The beach is also very nice at the hotel. ","April 23, 2019"
"Great little result to get away with family. Lots for younger kids to do. Older ones love the pools. They did shut at 10pm but the sun left them around 4 or 5 so the kids were out by then anyway. Would have been nice to heat them a little as the water was quite cold. Great on a really hot day I guess.The staff were amazing, so helpful and nothing was too much bother. The rooms was not to bad. A little run down, maybe due for an upgrade in 2-3 years time. And I think we got double beds not queen. But still comfortable enough. Besides only in the room for sleeping right so no big deal. Loved the resort as a whole though and would recommend","April 22, 2019"
"Stayed in the Tapa tower with a family of 4. This is not the place to be if you want a quiet relaxing vacation. It's a central location in Waikiki and alot of visitors flock to it. You know when you just want to go to the lobby looking like a hot mess to buy something from the ABC store? Well you'd have to completely get ready to do that or you might run into a sea of 50 people heading to an event because it also has a convention center. Food at the restaurants were minimum $100 for basic meals. Even RoundTable was $100 for 1 pizza, 1 salad and 4 sodas. Get your wallet out if you want to go to Waikiki as it is but be prepared to pay more here. The rooms were actually clean at Tapa on the 34th floor and quiet! Thank God! We had plenty of towels and the AC kept the room nice and cool. The pools were always packed with kids so we just went to the beach. To rent an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs at the beach is $50 and to paddle board for 3 hours is another $50. The Uber pick up is in one location, the bus's are somewhere else, the lobby is somewhere else..I was lost up until 2 days before we left lol. It's just a giant hot spot and not the place for me.","April 22, 2019"
"While I have heard that this resort can get a bit pricey, it delivers the value! The Rainbow Tower is beautiful, the views are amazing and the resort around it is like a little piece of heaven. Everything you need is right on the resort, but if you want to go off the resort, it is nestled in the Waikiki area of Honolulu and close to so much great stuff you won't have time to experience it all. The staff is friendly and helpful and the reputation is met or exceeded in all aspects!","April 22, 2019"
"Stayed at the Rainbow tower high floor. Great view of the lagoon and the ocean from the room, and the view of sunset is amazing from the balcony. There's a lot of restaurants and bars and shopping within the resort and others just walking distance away. Bed was comfy. Check-in was a bit chaotic, even after doing digital check-in, you still need to wait for room keys/towel cards. Checkout was a bit easier - if you use the fast checkout option, just drop-off keys in a fast checkout box. Checkout line is really long, as everyone checking out from multiple towers converge in the main lobby - so suggest the digital or fast checkout option. ","April 22, 2019"
"Our 8th visit to the Hilton and 2nd time in the Rainbow Tower. By far the best tower in the complex that we have stayed in. The views down the beach and the ocean are imply sstunning. A little more expensive than the other run of hotel towers but it looks in much better condition than the others. Worth the extra dollars? Yes I think it is especially cause it was our wedding anniversary. But overall the Hilton still rocks. Plenty of places to eat. The tour desk team are brilliant and helpful. And yes, we’ll be back for our 9th trip soon.","April 21, 2019"
"This place is huge and offers a lot, but we were happiest exploring Oahu beyond the resort. Upon check in we were asked to upgrade $100/night to put our two rooms on the same floor. The upgraded suites in the Diamond Head Tower was sad and grim with dark living rooms, dinged up furniture and dirty walls. We were moved to the Tapa Tower and placed on the same floor with a good deal of searching from the front desk manager. The rooms were better, but still a bit tired. Friends were in the Alii Tower and rooms were much nicer, but also more expensive to book. The resort food was pricey and uninspiring.I liked the comfortable beds, the coffee and mini fridge in the room, and a lovely view from the balcony. Our room was quiet and we could adjust the ac. Daily housekeeping service was very good. The kids liked the pools.I hope I’ll get back to O’ahu some day. I’ll look for a smaller resort or rent a house next time around.","April 21, 2019"
"I absolutely love this resort. It’s a one stop shop. There’s no need to exit the property if you don’t want to. The hotel is wonderful and the restaurants and shops ( ABC, Louis Vuitton, Starbucks, rental car, beaches, pools, etc... were all right at you finger tips. Although busy, the staff was very pleasant and kind. You can also attend a Luau on the property. It’s in walking distance to everything so no cat is needed. I’m HH and I really received the royal treatment. I stayed in a suite and because I’m Gold I received so many perks. I love this place and will definitely be staying here again on my next visit. ","April 21, 2019"
"We booked a week here as gold members expecting a lot more than what we experienced. Initial thoughts were ""this is nice"", well that went south after the first night. The bed was horrible!! We stated this to the concierge manager (unfortunately I didn't ask his name) that the mattress needed to be changed as it was killing both of our backs due to the condition. Expecting this to be done again as gold members. Well the fix was a sheet of plywood! a sheet of plywood is 4' wide in a 6' wide bed only slopes you both to each side. Definitely not the fix we were expecting. This was totally unacceptable and only made the sleep worse as you felt you were falling off the bed every night. So now we'll see how the ""make it right"" guarantee from Hilton works out.","April 21, 2019"
"Our family has spent three Christmas holidays in Hawaii. On two occasions we have stay at the Hilton Alii Tower in the Hilton Hawaiian Village. ""Alii"" means royalty If you make plans to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, be sure to stay at the Alli Tower. I recommend you secure a room with ocean front, not just ocean view. You will be glad you did. I believe the room service is average, not great. However, the rest of the hotel is world class.","April 20, 2019"
The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a great location with everything you might desire on site or a short walk from the hotel. There are several nice places to eat and shop in the village. Several shopping malls are a short distance away. Friday nights at 7:45 there are fireworks on the beach.,"April 20, 2019"
"We stayed here for 6 nights with two kids (13 & 11). While the location on the beach is exceptional (best beach location I saw in Waikiki) it is a fair distance from the heart of Waikiki (1-2kms). The choice of restaurants is limited, but if you choose not too, you don’t have to leave the resort. There is very limited shade around any of the pools (that’s if you can get a seat) & it cost ($35US) to hire an umbrella at the lagoon or beach, plus $18US each for a lounge. The water activities are also highly priced at $US45 an hour for most things. We stayed in the Rainbow tower which was comfortable & in a good location. It was a small walk to the shops, but in front of the lagoon & beach. (Wouldn’t stay in the Lagoon tower) even though it’s right on the kids pool & lagoon, it’s too far away from anything else. Same with the other towers, they are near the shops & restaurants, but far from the beach, lagoon & kids pool. Our room was clean, but the double beds proved to be a problem. They certainly need to be queen size, especially for a larger family. Overall if you like resorts, than this is a good choice.","April 20, 2019"
"Have stayed in most towers now at Hilton Hawaiian. Ali’i Tower is perfect for couples and has their own private pool, bar and exercise room. Most recently stayed in a suite in Tapa Tower which which had the perfect amount of room for myself and my two teenagers. Excellent choice of swimming pools and kids favourite is the lagoon using the SUP which is always great for a laugh or two!Heaps of meal options to choice from and staff are always super friendly and ready to help in anyway they can.","April 20, 2019"
"This place has everything.... shops, restaurants, pools, live entertainment, luau...etc. You never have to leave this area if you don't want to --although be sure you do as Oahu is gorgeous once you get out of the city. Great place - huge - thought pools, finding spots to eat, etc. would be very crowded but it wasn't. I would stay here again although very spendy with the resort fee and the parking fee.","April 19, 2019"
"I was expecting an overcrowded resort and tired room. Instead were amazing facilities, fantastic modern room (Kalia tower 1 bedroom) and wonderful staff. Trees there were plenty of people around but it was never overwhelming. Would highly recommend. ","April 18, 2019"
"This place has poor house keeping standard. My family decided to stay their for the weekend since we I have a ball to attend. We checked it around 0430 went to the room to get ready. We all left the room around 0530. Hubby was incharged with the kids, according to him they stayed at the beach the whole time and wasn't able to get back to the room around 8pm. While waiting for the girls to get done showering as my son walk towards the deck he stepped on a broken glass he was crying so bad due to excruciating pain. Hubby did some first aid and advised him to lay down as soon as he lay he got stabbed again with another piece of glass in his legs. My husband called the front desk 3 times yet no one came in to clean the room nor give any first aid assistance. After a long week of work that is the last thing my husband wanted he was hoping to relaxed but due to the incident he was stressed. He was so worried that my other 2 kids will get injured so he policed the room since no one showed up. I arrived around 11 as soon as I stepped in the room went straight to take a shower and I notice blood aon the tub and bathroom floor. So I asked my daughter who is still awake and she informed me of what had happened. Since everyone is already asleep I just depend on what my daughter told me and I started msgng the hotel thru their app. Informed them that I am so dissapointed regarding the incident but since it is too late I will get the band aid in the morning and no need for house keeping since its almost 1230am. I have trouble sleeping the time that I was about to fall asleep sleep a staff knock to offer a first aid, I was so mad but since he looked so concern I controlled my temper on top of that I do not wake up the my family. So I just grab a couple of band aid and when I checked the clock it is 0130 am. I wasn't able to go back to sleep after that. So after breakfast I went to the manager on duty and informed what happened. Suprisingly the 3initial call wasn't reported no wonder no one came in. He offered to extend our check out till 3pm and a $15 icecream. My son looked at me and said ""wow this is just how much my suffering cost and yet you paid 10x to stay here mom"". Since I do not have energy I just left and emailed the hilton customer service as well as post this feedback. For a hotel chain like Hilton as customer we expect a higher standard. But experiencing this kind of incident inside the room was so dissapointing. They should always put their customer and staff safety first at all time. No one ever pay to get a hotel room just to get stabbed by a broken peice of glass that is caused by their incompetence.","April 17, 2019"
We have stayed here 3 times. It can get expensive with the resort fees and parking fees. These are about $75 a day. You still have to pay to use the toys in the lagoon. These are $30 to $50 an hour. We were talked into upgrading to an ocean view. We were in the Rainbow tower overlooking the lagoon and a marina. You could see the ocean if you leaned out and looked left. The room was nice and clean. The staff was very good. We loved the food truck (Gilligan's Food Truck) that parks near the lagoon. Loved the Tapa pool which is heated.,"April 17, 2019"
"We celebrated our 13th year wedding anniversary here. We stayed in floor 22 with an oceanfront view, and it is a wow! Really magnificent to celebrate the anniversary overlooking a fireworks show. Their lagoon water activities are awesome, our kids enjoyed it. Thank you Hilton Hawaiian Village for a good customer service.","April 17, 2019"
We booked in on the seventh floor of the rainbow tower with a fantastic view of the Hilton Lagoon the below with the Ala Wai Boat Harbor . The room was spacious and perfect for just a staycation Friday nights at 7:45 they have a fantastic fireworks show which rivals some of the best for the amount of time that they do it for approximately 10 minute show beautiful right in front of our room it’s best if you went from the beach however in front of the super pool or from over near the big boat dock for the Atlantis submarine tour,"April 15, 2019"
"After reading reviews, I was expecting overcrowded beaches and screaming kids, but it was actually a fun experience. The grounds were amazing, the beach just steps from the resort with a nice walking path. The lagoon offers all the fun riding water toys and so many restaurant options. Yes, the pool chairs get taken by 9:00 am or so and people save them with their towels, but you can get a spot on the beach about anytime, plus the lagoon is expansive if you want to set up there. Our rooms were nice, best hotel coffee ever and maid service wonderful. All the resort restaurants were overpriced and not that great, so we ventured next door to Cinnamons for a few meals and then back to the main road Ala Moana to Tropical Tribe for breakfast açaí bowls a couple times. Our favorite resort spot was Lapperts coffee and bakery. The best gooey macadamia nut sticky buns and delicious ice cream with your typical as well as specialty island flavors. Check out the tribute to past celebrity guests, especially Elvis. Pretty cool. We stayed in the Rainbow tower, which seems to be closest to the lagoon, pool and beach.","April 14, 2019"
"This hotel and property is huge. If you watch Hawaii Five-0, this is where the Rainbow Tower is located. It has several swimming pools, restaurants and bars and an ABC store, two Starbucks and other shops. The village mall is also on the property Direct beach access and also has a lagoon. On Friday’s there’s a Fireworks show on the beach. Very comfortable place and good for family. You don’t need s car to get around. Use public transportation or Uber or Lyft or walk. ","April 13, 2019"
"We were a retired couple and found the property has very thing you could want. For us however it was too busy and was near impossible to get a chair by any of the pools, the restaurants were also very busy. All the pools were crowded especially with children. They need to set aside an adults only pool. It is a one stop shop for all your needs. Even the basic rooms were spacious with good beds","April 13, 2019"
"It was like staying in a little city. We really didn’t need to leave. From restaurant to bar to shopping, it was all right there. The swimming pools, water slides, lagoon and beach were footsteps away. The kids had a blast and the adults got up relax.","April 13, 2019"
"I’ve been traveling to HHV for many years and I’m amazed how each visit appears to be better than the last. I was upgraded to a beautiful ocean view room in the Rainbow Tower which took my breath away. HHV has a huge variety of restaurants to choose from including a great sandwich location. This resort is massive and it’s helpful to walk around to be aware of all its offerings. I highly recommend this to the business traveler, family and 1st time visitors. The location is perfect!","April 13, 2019"
This hotel is a great place to stay. Large spacious rooms and great extras. Located on the beach and every Friday they have fireworks. Great restaurants with a range of prices. A variety of shops. Helpful employees and friendly.,"April 13, 2019"
Booked a room through Hotels.com and it looks nothing like the pictures shown on the website. Very out dated decor must be at least 20 years without refurbishment. Disappointing . No air in bathroom just poorly working fan so it smells damp and is humid and unpleasant to use.,"April 13, 2019"
"I stayed at Hilton Hawaiian Village 4 nights during my holidays in Honolulu.I am Diamond member an i seen my fair share of hilton hotels in many countries, i usually do not loose time and bother to write reviews even if the service was so so but i have to write about this hotel because i felt really really bad about it.I booked 4 nights on the ali tower in the partial ocean view room, usually when i go hiltons i book the lowest rate room and try to score a better room with my diamond membership. I did not do this on Hilton Hawaiian because in the app recommend to book the desired room due to high occupancy season will limit the available upgrades.When i got to the lobby for check in i was not expecting or requesting an upgrade i just handed my passport to the reception guy. The reception guy after see my membership he thank me for my loyaly as they usually do in every hilton. I right after he ask me if first time in honolulu which i said yes it is. Then he ask me if i would like to have ocean front instead of my current partial ocean booking, because as a holiday i should enjoy the best views. I reply him yes that i would love to have the front ocean, then 15 min later checking his computer for available rooms, he said that i was lucky cause they had available rooms, i quickly got excited about this for just few seconds until he said that i had to pay for this room the rate difference. I was truly in shock that all his nice words and everything was just to sell me a more expensive room!!. I ask him why i have to pay when im diamond and diamond offer free upgrade, his answer was because ali tower is too premium and it does not free upgrades never. Only the cheap towers have upgrades. This is a total lie, diamond include premium rooms and suite upgrade as well, and i was already paying for a premium room in the premium tower.Anyway i reject his ""offer"" and head to my room, i will resume the rest of wrong things about this hotel:- room was not clean (there was food in the fridge from previous guest)- 40usd compulsory daily resort fee include movies (not so big selections of them and now with netflix make this kind of useless) and play station 3 with just 2 games for rent. - room is not that luxury or well design as they try to sell you. Horrible shower.- safe deposit box need to pay extra- ali tower swimming pool is small, also jacuzzi is dirty and small- staff are uncapable of following any simple request need to call them multiple times.- no breakfast include no matter which level or room you have, only 10usd daily credit just for diamonds, which cover only the tips for the waiter when you go to their restaurants.- beach chair, snorkel or anything you need for enjoying the beach is not included need to pay extra money and is not cheap.- parking almost 50usd when across the road have parking for 16usd daily.- too crowd to enjoy anything- no cameras anywhere, no security at all!!This hotel is a tourist trap!, oahu is a nice island, not as nice as the big island but worth it to go. You do not need this hotel to enjoy the island. My recommendation find another hotel.","April 13, 2019"
"This place is BUSY. Lots of people, lots of families, great shopping at the resort itself and then less than a mile away-you can walk along the beach to get there-one of the most intense luxury shopping experiences in the world. We stayed in the Ali'i Tower which was definitely the less hectic of the towers there. Upgraded to an oceanfront corner room on the 12th floor which was key. We could watch everything going on down below without having to actually be in the fray. ","April 13, 2019"
"This was my second time at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in less than two years. The first time I came, I was so in awe of Hawaii that I probably overlooked some glaring annoyances about this property. The Hilton is not relaxing. I think I heard screaming children and infants every time I stepped out of my room. The focus is on families and as someone traveling with friends, we felt neglected by this resort.The $45 nightly resort fee is a rip-off. It goes towards WiFi, activities and a bunch of crap that doesn’t mean anything. I took a lei making class which was enjoyable but didn’t feel like it warranted a resort fee. That’s an activity you can pay $5-$10 to do one time. I have never used any of the pools because they are overcrowded and again, filled with screaming children.Dining options are dismal. Either have a $150 subpar dinner at Tropics or starve, I guess? Breakfast was particularly hard. Either you spend $70 on eggs and toast at Tropics or you can go to Starbucks, spend maybe $30 but wait in line for almost an hour. Not kidding, from the time I got in line to the time I walked out of the store, it had been nearly 45 minutes. There’s no where in the resort where you can just grab a quick coffee and be done with it. We requested Diamond Head Tower because I like the tower’s proximity to things. We paid an “upgrade fee” for an ocean view room. The view was indeed spectacular, but the surrounding noise wasn’t. Our room was on the Eastern side of the tower and overlooked the back of the neighboring hotel, Hale Koa. During the day, we were treated to nonstop construction noise from Hale Koa and loud trucks making deliveries to Hale Koa- everyday, all day. At night time, their beachfront bar blasted music so loud, I could hear it with our lanai doors closed. If you’re struggling to get used to the time change and are looking for a good nights sleep, you will have to sleep according to the Hale Koa’s live music schedule. Totally unacceptable. I felt stupid paying an upgraded fee for a room that wasn’t the least bit quiet. Ocean view be damned.The rooms are dated and nothing spectacular. There’s barely any charging outlets and the the furniture is just old and ugly. There is nothing modern about these rooms. My bathroom in my tiny Manhattan apartment was bigger than the bathroom in our room - pretty sad. Price gouging is rampant throughout the restaurants and retail shops. Plan to go bankrupt before you head home. I used the Mandara Spa for a massage and didn’t have any complaints. It was an average experience for above average prices, but that’s a running theme in this hotel. I do have to say I have never had an issue with the staff and everyone was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff was particularly friendly and efficient - they were probably the most consistent thing about the hotel experience. They left our rooms perfect at the end of each day and always said hello when we saw them in the hall. All of this being said, I am not returning to this hotel. I am looking for a more upscale, relaxing experience and the Hilton does not offer this between outdated rooms and the amount of children running like monsters throughout this resort. This hotel is like the Hawaiian version of Six Flags. If that’s your thing, cool. However, you can catch me on the North Shore of Oahu next time or the adults only resort on Maui.","April 13, 2019"
"This hotel is located right on the beach, which is great. However for the money we spent we felt ripped off. The food choices were limited and just not worth the money we spent. The best meal we had was on the O’ahu nature tour of the north coast at a local place called Fumi’s. The elevators are in need of paint which is an easy fix. The air conditioner doesn’t go below 68 so you’re out of luck if you like your room cooler. You can’t sit on your balcony after sunset since there is no light outside. There are also way too many people at any given time, most of them with screaming kids.We will not be returning to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I hope someone is reading these reviews and does something to fix the situation.","April 12, 2019"
"We have spent several days here and have thoroughly enjoyed each day. The pools are refreshing, the luau fantastic, rooms are beautiful and the staff very helpful!! A perfect location on a lovely swimming beach ! We highly recommend this!!","April 12, 2019"
"First time in Hawaii and booked into the Hilton Village on the recommendation of my travel agent. Huge hotel complex with multiple pools, bars, shops and restaurants. Well managed and clean but SO expensive to get anything to eat or drink on campus. Be warned. Double up on whatever spending money you were planning to bring.","April 12, 2019"
This resort is huge and has lots to offer such as shopping and restaurant choices. If you are on a budget walk around to find cheaper breakfast places such as CJ’s. We spent $250 for an American style buffet in the first two mornings which is over $300 CAD. I wasn’t that impressed with the beach and prefer Maui sand but the lagoon is great for kids.,"April 12, 2019"
So I just recently had the experience to stay here!! I love love love it!! So I was there to get married and we decided to have a few friends to help us celebrate. Everyone stayed on this resort. They have about 4 or 5 different towers on this resort and I luckily had at least two friends staying in all. We first stayed in the Rainbow Tower Ocean View and it was amazing. That view is breathtaking!!! I did think the bathroom could have been bigger but everything worked so it’s all good! We stayed there for 3 days then moved to the All’i tower one bedroom suite. AMAZING!!!! The bathrooms were EVERYTHING!!! The balcony I’m really running out of words. We did get stuck (literally) in the room and had call to get someone come help us out. I didn’t panic that much because it was on my wedding night! They have everything you need on the resort. I mean EVERYTHING!!!! It’s definitely worth the stay. Trust me,"April 11, 2019"
"Room, 2 Double Beds, Oceanfront, Location was excellent. Beautiful and relaxing views from the Rainbow Tower. Plenty of shops and restaurants really feels like a village! We loved it! Great fun and doesn’t feel over crowded even though it’s massive. Very friendly stuff and professional. ","April 11, 2019"
"The service and overall experience was was brilliant! There are many things to do in whole village and i would highly recommend purchasing a snorkel and goggles from one of the ABC stores and just swimming around the beach near the boat pier, we saw more fish than when on the submarine.The room in the Ali Tower was slightly noisy due to other guests and the lifts.","April 11, 2019"
"Excellent location, beautiful resort, excellent food and accomditaions. We had an excellent vacation and look forward to a return visit. Overall the resort is incredible, shopping, dining & entertainment all wrapped into one loction.","April 11, 2019"
"I had called a week ahead and said we’d be checking in late, we paid top dollar for a King oceanfront and I didn’t want to lose it. We were put in a room with 2 queens and with what I’d consider a partial ocean view. Took 2 moves the next day to get a King Oceanfront room. When that finally happened, all was well. Beautiful, clean resort with friendly staff. The biggest negative is the dining/drink options on site were incredibly expensive, incredibly over priced. Another reviewer posted “Bring More Money.” He wasn’t kidding. ","April 10, 2019"
"I stayed here x4 nights for business. Check in was a long process. Hilton Honor Diamond status and online checking did not help— still 20+ minutes. Hotel is a confusing labyrinth of towers, corridors, and retail. I’m not sure if anyone gave zoning a consideration while they built the ‘village’. The staff seems undermanned, stressed, and not prepared for the hordes of guests that roam the property. My room’s air conditioner was very loud. Sounded like an old bathroom vent fan combined with the rattling of a locomotive. Spoke to x2 managers (a challenge in itself) and told them I was not satisfied. They had folks change the filters, but it did not help. While I was in the room, I kept the AC off... including while I slept. Not what I’d expect at a ‘resort’. Food prices were outrageous. Quality unimpressive. Security around the hotel was lacking. It showed by the sketchy activities that were going on unchallenged by police officers or hotel security. Waikiki beach was OK. For a vacation, I’d take my money somewhere else. ","April 10, 2019"
Hotel is massive .it’s right in the beach close to all major shops only 20 mins away from the airport it’s quite expensive to eat and drink But you can go downtown on the hard rock and other famous then you can eat it,"April 9, 2019"
"We got an offer from Hilton to know about it’s time share program. Hilton Hawaiian Village is great place for vacation. Rooms are spacious, very good quality and comfortable mattresses and pillows -for good and relaxing night sleep. Beach is steps away from all towers. Lovely music entertainment. Very knowledgeable people from Time share program. And we were very close to buy -amazing offer. The only reason we decided to postpone was that we would like to experience cruise vacation and see how often we might use Points program in nearest future. Overall we have very good time. ","April 9, 2019"
Very crowded. End of story. It took us 20 minutes in line just to check in. Long waits to the few places to eat on site. Our family of 4 couldn't eat a simple meal for under $200 including the breakfast buffet. We won't be going back to Waikiki again.,"April 9, 2019"
Stayed her for 7 days with my wife and we love this resort. It's a bustling place but it's nice to so close to so many good restaurants and shops. We only had to rent a car for 3 days to get our excursions done for the week. The rest we could walk to from the resort. You have your calm lagoon for sampling paddle boards and water bikes. Then you have your ocean to hang out with mild waves. Easy check in and check out and easy to get cab if need be. We will definitely will be back here.,"April 9, 2019"
"So the property is excellent. The staff mostly awesome. Lots to do, good options for pickups for tours, etc. We were in K tower (25th floor), with the ""Cheap"" resort view. It looked across the city at Diamond head and the mountains and a ring side seat for sunrise...for a cheap view, was the best I have had. Downsides, check-in is extremely slow, be very careful in the tour offices, they hammer you relentlessly on buying Hilton timeshares.","April 9, 2019"
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS HOTEL! It was amazing. It had everything you imagine. Let me start with the beach, lagoon, and pools. The lagoon was fabulous. I couldn’t imagine having a better lagoon. You could snorkel and do anything you wanted in the lagoon. You were even able to rent out paddle boards, boats, canoes, water trikes, and so much more. Now the pools were great too. I would say though, the one pool with the water slide was a bit on the small side, and was hard to find a seat (basically like every pool), but had a great water slide and was family friendly. Now let’s get to the amazing beach. OMG! The view of Honolulu was spectacular. You could see all the way from Diamondhead to the end of Honolulu. The sun set over the water and was just overall beautiful. The resort itself was great, with all the luxury’s you could think of. You had a Louis Vuitton store on the property (one of my favorites), jewelry, a great cookie company called Honolulu cookie company, and much more. The restaurants ranged from casual dining to fancy and classical. The service was amazing and everybody was friendly, especially the locals. Now, Honolulu is like California. There are some scratchy parts, and things can be different. But everything is just beautiful in the end. I’m not saying that California isn’t a beautiful place, but can have some sketchy areas, just like every tiger city. So, if your looking to go to one of the islands, I would highly consider this hotel to be one of your options. Thanks for reading this","April 8, 2019"
"Arrived early and went ahead and checked in. Check in lady said we could switch our room to another room that was almost ready, they would send me a text when it was ready. 3 hours later, no text. Another agent told me it was a problem with my wireless provider. That was just a plain outright lie. They were not friendly at all. The luggage staff actually broke the handle on my suitcase. No acknowledgement or any care at all by the staff. The room was finally ready in the Rainbow Tower after 3 hours, but promised much earlier. The room was not very clean. A beautiful spot on the beach but the staff was the worst. They showed me zero hospitality. I'll never go there again or advise anyone else to either.","April 8, 2019"
"Our door locking mechanism was faulty and we are on the 30th floor. Hilton Resort is not doing anything and said their insurance will contact us after 10-15 business days. Sounds like a total inside job, So disappointed in Hilton! Spoke with two managers who were not helpful and short but she eventually apologized. Finally got escalated to the higher manager and he kept emphasizing they have to follow protocol. We have no money, had to cancel our credit cards and freeze our bank accounts. Hilton said as a gesture from them they will comp one meal, breakfast, lunch or dinner, nothing else. They offered a taxi voucher for us to go to a bank but our accounts are frozen and our bank isn’t even here on this island! No manager came to our room and even showed their face which obviously lacks the the importance of what just happened to our family. No one checked to see if we were okay and in general customer service here was terrible. We had to make the request ourselves to even change rooms! We were treated like a transaction, no empathy for how violated we were. We are all so shaken up and this whole experience has made us weary about traveling in general. This is such a sad and unfortunate experience that we never imagined would ever happen to us. Would never stay here again or any Hilton brand if this is how they treat their guests. Shame on you Hilton.","April 8, 2019"
"Signed up and paid in advance with a Delta Vacation Package. After waiting in line for over 20 minutes to check in, we were advised that our reservation was split into two reservations running back to back, but that they would merge them. At the end of the first reservation we were notified that we were to check out. Spoke with the front desk and were told not to worry, the merge was taken care of. The next morning the housekeeper knocked and asked how soon we would be leaving the room and checking out. Back to the front desk to be told that all was well and that we did not need to check out until the end of our second reservation! When we checked in, we were advised that an ADDITIONAL charge of $45 per day would be charged, in addition to what was paid in advance, for a ""Daily Resort Charge"" whick amounted to not much more than a fee for WiFi access. Now, please bear in mind that I have live in Honolulu twice during my adult life and that I have stayed in this hotel several times since it was a Kaiser Hotel. This visit was a major departure from the services that I previously enjoyed! The charges for food and drinks were unbelieveably expensive. A single small glass of house wine was $17. A hamburger was in excess of $25. Need I say more about price gouging?! To go further, maintenance was less than what was expected. Broken tile in the bathroom. Torn chair on the lanai. Roach in room. Bird droppings on Lanai. I have the photos. Need I go on?","April 8, 2019"
"I personally love this place! First of, the beach in front of the Hilton is definitely the nicest out of the whole Waikiki area. Actually, it's probably 10 times wider than the rest of Waikiki. So you are not packed like sardines in a can;) The pools are big and right next to the beach. There is a man made pond for the little ones where you can try paddle boarding or surf breaks right in front of the hotel in case you want to learn how to surf. Also the landscaping, ponds with fish and turtles, parrots, tiki torches lid up every evening by a man dressed like a proper Hawaiian (read: almost naked) it all adds to the experience! It really feels like a paradise. As far as the location - it's located about 10 min walk to Waikiki's most touristy street Kalakaua Av. It's a very nice walk, most of it right next to the beach. Perfect for catching a sunset. It's also about 10 min from Ala Moana - Hawaii's best shopping mall with fun bars/restaurants with more of a local feel. Oh, and I almost forgot - the fireworks at the Hilton (every Friday at 7.40pm) are the best ever!","April 8, 2019"
"We can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed our trip to Waikiki and our stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort! The check-in was a breeze, resort activities were great as was the food! We did Yoga several times and even went to the lei making class they offered! The room was amazing in the Ali’i Tower with access to a private pool area with its own fitness room. The staff was warm and welcoming, and the room was so clean! Housekeeping really took care of us! We didn’t have young children with us but this resort has amazing facilities to appeal to families with children or individuals. So many restaurants within walking distance and easy Uber pick up! Thank you Hilton for providing our family with a dreamy vacation! ","April 7, 2019"
"The Rainbow Tower has great rooms, a fast new elevator system and awesome views but minimal water pressure in the showers. The Lagoon Tower (timeshare only) is home away from home with full amenities including great laundry facilities but minimal water pressure in the showers and old, outdated elevators.The Ali Tower has its own pool and open air gym.The Diamond Head tower has decent water pressure but slow elevators.The Kalia Tower (timeshare and hotel facilities) has amazing water prescreen the shower, great elevators but terrible albeit new laundry facilities (it takes 2+ hours for each wash or dry cycle which is ridiculous when are there are only 2 per floor. It is nearly impossible to do laundry at any time of day or night as people leave their stuff in and signs tell you not to move other people's stuff) The resort wide adult only pool, spa and the gym are also in this building. Haven't stayed in the new Grand Islander yet.","April 7, 2019"
"nothing to complain about except the prices as they charge for everything but saying that i have no complaints, from the moment i was picked up at the airport coming in late at night 23-45pm i was met at the Bus terminal in the hotel and taken to check in and as i was A Hilton honors member i was upgraded to a partial sea view in Tapper tower 1755 the room was good and clean and had everything i wanted including a fridge for my insulin ,The staff are friendly in all departments from the bell station front desk and taxi service i used the Buffett once and although $40 its still good value mostly i used the Bar opposite which is cheaper but you pay for coffee juice extra and get a portion so Buffett in the long run you have a choice i also used IHOP once which is a lot cheaper but you pay for what you get i even went into Waikiki by bus for $2-00 return and had breakfast there 50% cheaper and spent the day on the beach there ,Now for the beach nice beach clear blue terquise waters with a gentle slope but Sunbeds and Umberellas are outragous at $50 for bed and chair per day but i tried it once and had good prompt service,The big pool has no shade atall and there is no romm to swing a cat no personal space at all but a drinks service which you will need at 80f in the shade and there is no shade the bars are expensive and i paid $10 for a Lognboard craft ","April 7, 2019"
"We just arrived at the Hilton Hawaiian Village after a really wonderful 8 nights at Hilton Waikoloa Village. Admittedly, our expectations were high, but the room that we have been given (after a $50 more per night) is just woeful! It’s really old room and whilst big is badly set out. We got a pull out bed for our daughter and had to ring down for blankets and pillows. The sheet on the pull out looks like it hasn’t been changed in a while. The bathroom is very old and shower very below par. We’ve stayed at a lot of Hilton properties as we usually trust the quality - unfortunately no more!","April 6, 2019"
"I was nervous about staying here as the reviews are mixed. We stayed six nights in a 2 bedroom condo in the Lagoon Tower and had a fabulous time!Pros:The condo was great. Clean, updated, beautiful view, full kitchen, laundry room around the corner with 2 machines that were always open. The lagoon area is wonderful, especially in the morning before it gets too crowded with water toys. It is close to the tower and shallow.The beach is nice, too. It is wide and wasn’t too crowded. The water was warmer than the lagoon, definitely bearable at this time of year.The pools are great. The lagoon pool’s water slides were fun and the wide steps are great for little ones. We loved the Tapa pool. Again, the wide steps are great for toddlers and the pool temperature was probably upper 80s. The village is convenient, especially the ABC stores. Lapperts or Dairy Queen were fun for ice cream. The grounds are beautiful. Our kids loved watching the fish and turtles in the ponds.Friday night fireworks were a fun treat. Cons:Food prices in the hotel restaurants are very, very expensive. Chairs were hard to come by around the pools.Parking rates are ridiculous. You have to pay every time you come out. It isn’t charged to your room. Tips:Whole Foods is about a 10 min drive. We ate breakfast and lunch in our condo to keep costs down. Lapperts coffee is good. Cheaper than Starbucks and a shorter line, too. We did the luau at Experience Nutridge. A much smaller, more unique experience than the luau on top of the parking garage. We loved it. We loved our trip to the Northshore. We swam in the waterfall at Waimea Falls and stopped at Seven Brothers and Matsumoto Shave Ice on the way back. I thought I’d definitely want to visit another island next trip to Hawaii, but we had such a good time I think we may come back!","April 6, 2019"
"Our family of 4 had a long weekend vacation at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a relaxing staycation to celebrate my 40th birthday. The staff really went above and beyond to make sure our stay and celebration was epic and unforgettable. Aloha spirit is alive and well.We live on the west side of the island of Oahu. The Hilton Hawaiian Villiage is the largest property on Waikiki beach and is setup in prime location. With a large and perfect waikiki beachfront, with activities on site for all ages, and between Ala Moana shopping center and the shops and restaurants of Waikiki. You can stay on site the whole time you are there, or easily walk to the best of what Waikiki has to offer. They have a wide beachfront with walk up access to watersports including the Atlantis submarine and a catamaran boat. The beach is protected by reef making the water safe for the kids to play without big waves to manage. They also have a salt water lagoon that is clean, safe, and perfect to try out SUP or an aqua bike. They have multiple pools for adults and children, however the popular pools can get very crowded, especially the one with the waterslides and jacuzzi. You can be active or just relax and still have a memorable experience.What really made the stay epic started with the staff. The Hilton is blessed with amazing leaders like Debi and Chasity, who are very passionate about caring for their guests and making sure every moment spent on site is memorable. They were very attentive and responded at night and even on the weekends. Despite our visit being during the busy spring break, they helped us find a room with an amazing view and were always available to help us with anything we needed. I will always be appreciative of their generosity and focus on customer service and satisfaction. They alone helped make me a Hilton believer.As for our room, we stayed in a one bedroom suite in the Tapa Tower on the 28th floor. As you walk around the resort you will notice a number of towers recently built beautiful and brand new. The Tapa Tower was one of the original resort towers that has a distinct hawaiian kapa design and feel to it. As you will read in some other reviews, the Tapa tower is indeed dated, especially compared to the newer towers, but still a solid tower and it did not take away anything from our stay. The room was BIG and spacious, with TWO balconies that each gave us a different and unique experience. I spent a lot of time on the balconies just in awe of the views of the ocean, sunset, beautiful resort, and starlight luau from one balcony. And enjoying my coffee from the bedroom balcony in the morning waking up with the city view and watching the clouds form at the green Ko'olau mountains and slowly make their way across the sky.With 1.5 baths, the kids had their own place to wash up and get ready, nobody had to wait for the bathroom.The living room was huge, it had a TV, a sofa bed big enough for our two kids, a wet bar and mini fridge, and a dining table right in front of corner windows with a panoramic view of ocean to mountain.The maid service was awesome, leaving extra towels for us when we left a note before going out to the pools. I'm sure we could have asked for any kind of convenience and the staff would try their best to help us.There are also activities included in the resort fee. They have outdoor movies on the lawn on certain nights where we laid out a picnic blanket and ate take out dinner from a nearby restaurant while we watched the movie. They also have morning yoga and hula lessons on the lawn that were fun.All in all, we had a great time. Many thanks to Debi and Chasity again and for all the staff who helped make our stay a memorable one!","April 5, 2019"
"You won’t get a room before 4 Pm so better opt for a hotel where you get an option of early chrckin ( if flying in early. In fact when requested an early check in over the phone, one of the staff said I might have to pay additional $200 to get an early access. Accommodation was good but poor service. Not opting for Hilton next time. ","April 4, 2019"
"Horrendous customer service! I live on the North Shore of the island and wanted a fun Waikiki Staycation. I am supposed to receive a partner rate since I work at another hotel on island, but after trying to make my reservation for three days straight and being passed around on the phone for an absurd amount of time, I was told I could no longer get the partner rate since I was too ""late."" They offered me the more expensive Kama'aina rate and took my address. Disappointed, I agreed to the higher rate. Upon arrival, my boyfriend (a local business owner) and myself were lectured by the front desk staff member about how we should not qualify for the Kama'aina rate because we are white. He told us that we were not children of the land even though we both work and live here and consider Hawaii home. The rooms were disappointing and the extra fees were too much for the service. Will not return or recommend to anyone. I am a wedding planner for destination weddings, and I will actively tell my clients and their guests not to stay here.","April 4, 2019"
"Was in town for 3 nights starting 31 March for business. On arrival, was upgraded, as i am a HH Diamond to an ocean view in Tapa tower. Excellent service by the valets, the front desk, guest services, and at the various restaurants/Starbucks, etc.While it has everything you might need nearby, don’t forget to venture off the resort to see the rest of Waikiki.As a tip, the Starbucks near the Tapa tower is usually packed in the morning, try the one at the Kaia tower, less busy, same service or better.On check in, they took great care of frequent/Diamond members. Received a check in via text each day, and while i didn’t have any problems, they appeared ready to get into fixit mode. They also provided a hospitality room since my flight was later at night and i had to work during the day - i wanted to change for the flight. They ensured a room was available. Tropics bar was a hit for my colleagues. Good drinks and views.Love the live music in the Tapa tower lounge.While my room had an excellent bed and was clean throughout, yes, the hotel does look a bit dated in some rooms, around the hallways, elevators, and throughout. That stated, my king bed was comfortable, clean, and looked new.I don’t think you will be disappointed in your stay!","April 4, 2019"
"We stayed for a week. Started in the Kalia Tower, then switched to the Rainbow Tower. Being a frequent traveler, I ignored reading most of the reviews about the shear size of the property, along with the somewhat-confusing check-in situation. It is a bit daunting when you first arrive, trying to figure out which line to stand is, as there are people everywhere. The staff was helpful, but lines moved slowly. Bottom line is that you are really paying for the prime location and over abundance of restaurants, shops, pools, etc. Once we made it our room, we were disappointed with the Kalia Tower King Room. Decent ocean view but the furnishings felt worn and the tower in general seemed a bit dated. The only really nice feature is the adults-only pool and the 4th floor workout facility, which is large are pretty crowded by 6am. We were able to switch to the Rainbow tower on Day 2, which had a better view/location and also felt a little newer and nicer. The main pool area was busy, but not really any different than Disneyworld or Vegas pools. We always found chairs. Since we were there in late March, it was extremely crowded and that took away from my expectation of it being a more relaxing destination. The beach and lagoon areas at the hotel are very nice, and you can't beat the sunsets. A lot of the excursion transportation companies pick up very close to the hotel, so if you do those, you don't have far to walk. Overall, I would give it 4.5 out of 5. The biggest detractor is that it is so big and busy all of the time. If that is your thing, then go for it. If your are looking for a more secluded type of vacation, don't choose Waikiki Beach area, as there are people everywhere.","April 4, 2019"
"I went with my 70 yr old mother and 2 16 yr old girls and everyone had a great time. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. A shout out to our housekeeper for Room 1434 in the Tapa building for the week of March 26th (sorry, didn't get her name) who was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!We were there over Spring Break so, as to be expected, it was crowded however, never had an issue finding a spot on the beach. Lambert's coffee and ice cream shop is a MUST. The carrot cake and cinnamon buns were delicious - coffee considerably better (and less expensive) than Starbuck's. We didn't eat on the resort except for a happy hour at the Japanese restaurant which was very tasty and reasonably priced (for a Honolulu resort ;-) )","April 3, 2019"
"We had an Ocean View Room in Ali’i Tower. The room was nice and I definitely recommend this tower due to the private check-in, concierge, pool, etc...My only complaints were 1)I asked if booking with a 3rd party site was frowned upon. I was told the only difference was that I wouldn’t get the Hilton points...that’s fine since booking with Expedia was roughly $500 cheaper. Now that we’re here, I’m told that I don’t get the extra benefits of being a Gold member since I didn’t book direct. 2)My wife and I are celebrating 15 years together, so I called and asked for champagne to be in the room. The gentleman I spoke with assured me he would leave a note in the system and that they would do something nice. Instead, the man at check-in said he had no knowledge of our anniversary and they can’t send champagne to the room. He offered me...2 cupcakes. Mind you, I didn’t ask for anything free. I just wanted it in my room, but instead I get offered 2 cupcakes. No thanks.We leave in a day and a half, other than the inconveniences, this is a great resort","April 3, 2019"
"Was there visiting and was too crowded, long waits for elevators. Pools full. No towels.Long wait on their restaurants and shops. They have a very small beach.Even for the help desk was a very long wait.And was not on their high season.","April 3, 2019"
"Depending on the length of your stay on Waikiki Beach, there is the strong possibility that you may not have to leave the resort. Located on a 22 acre parcel right on Waikiki Beach, there are about five towers with rooms, the most famous tower being the ""Rainbow Tower"". There were at least 20 different restaurants of various cuisines and desserts. There were five pools, a saltwater lagoon between the ""Rainbow Tower"" and the ocean and a spa. There is plenty of shopping with 90 shops, as well as a number of kids' activities - if you need a break. There is even a small garden with over 60 different species of exotic birds, fish and animals. Though, not finally, but not to be forgotten, every Friday night guests can enjoy a fireworks display along Waikiki Beach. This is also a great place to come and visit and stroll the shops and restaurants, as well as people watch. Are the prices expensive? Well, you are on Hawaii, so the prices are not cheap.","April 3, 2019"
"The Hilton was very nice. We were put in a room far away from the beach and main pool. After changing to stay in the preferable Rainbow tower, it was very comfortable with a great view of the beach, Ocean and Diamond Head. The room was nice with a balcony and we could see the Friday night fireworks perfectly. The hotel, pool and beach were very crowded. The Starbucks coffee shop was very expensive as was food at the hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful. We were able to rent a car on property for the day and spent one day driving lol over the island. There were bikes you could rent and we did that one day and rode all around. A fun trip!","April 2, 2019"
"My family loved staying here. We were in the Tapa Tower (3256). Seeing some of the reviews on here, I expected a tired room far from the resort's amenities. This couldn't have been further from the truth! The room had a king bed, a comfy sofabed and more than enough space for an air mattress for our 2yo. Best of all, our ""partial ocean view"" went from the ocean and lagoon to the mountains behind the resort. To be sure, the decor is a bit dated but the room was very clean, the A/C worked, the beds were comfortable, and we very rarely heard noises from adjoining rooms. The Tapa pool right outside the elevator lobby, and the other pools and beach were a 5 min stroll through the resort's koi ponds and landscaped gardens.Pools: The variety of pools was great for our 2yo and 5yo, from the Paradise Pool with water slides, to the large kids pool by the beach, to the cozy Tapa pool (we didn't make it to the Kalia pool, which doesn't allow kids, but it did look like an oasis for aduts).The Beach: This is probably the best stretch of beach in Waikiki. While some sections are narrow, the beach here is wide and never felt overly crowded. Food: Yes, food here is pricey, but not out of line with resorts. For bargains, you can grab hot dogs or sandwiches at the WikiWiki or DQ for $5-8 each, and for more variety, head further into Waikiki or to the nearby Ala Moana mall.Camp Penguin: Our 5yo absolutely loved it. She went there two days and would have gladly gone more if we stayed longer. ","April 2, 2019"
Busy place but lots of fun! Staff are great. Rooms are well kept and clean. Some of the pools need some tlc. Nice selection of shops and restaurants at the hotel. Hotel is at the far end of the Waikiki strip and needs better access to the trolley. ,"April 2, 2019"
"Stayed in the Ali'i tower, one bedroom. Amazing view and great suite. Recently renovated. Check in was very slow but very nice. The rest of the resort is huge and was very crowded but this location was a nice option within the Village. Our teenage daughters loved it.","April 2, 2019"
"We spent most of a week at the Village and had a great time. Rooms were well appointed, clean and beautiful views out to the beach and ocean. Staff were very helpful. The property has many restaurants and shopping available but was still good to go out and explore. Always good to see the property o the modern version of Hawaii 50, brings back great memories of our stay there.","April 2, 2019"
"The hotel was great. A lot to do and everything was around the property. The room at the rainbow towel was fine. Didn’t look old. Please go to Groupon an get your tours this way. I saved 50% or more ( yes, wow!!). Use Uber for everything (to/from airport and around. Enjoy","April 1, 2019"
It is nice in the middle but BIG! they have everything you need restaurants coffee shops and activities not to mention a lagoon. and like 5 towers. It really is a one stop shop. but it is in the middle of everything else. The staff is great and all the activities even a bus station.,"April 1, 2019"
"We stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort at the end of our trip so I will make some comparisons in my review.I experienced some frustrations with the Hilton during our stay. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, a person in our party was unable to travel. Although we booked everything six months ago, I was told that I needed to rebook the hotel when I called the Hilton just a couple weeks before our stay. They couldn’t honor the original price, therefore we needed to rebook through Snap Travel to get a comparative price and therefore, since we booked with an outside company, the Hilton would not honor our Gold member status. This put a damper on the trip as we did not receive our complimentary breakfast, any hotel points or the free waters that are included for Gold members.Arrival and check in- There were long lines for check in when we arrived at the resort shortly after 3:30. Room- Not as spacious as the Outrigger. We had two double beds. Our room was in the Rainbow tower on the 29th floor with a gorgeous view. I would definitely recommend this tower/floor with partial ocean view. Great location to watch the sunsets. The towels in the room are bigger than the towels given at the pool. I requested late check out (noon) and I was told that they could not accommodate because they book 98% full most of the year so this was an unreasonable request. I did receive late check out without a problem at the Outrigger.Perks- A big plus for this hotel was the DVD rental kiosk in the lobby. New releases were offered and it was so convenient. We got a movie every night. We also loved the lei making. When were arrived at the resort, we couldn’t sign up because it was already full, but they were able to squeeze us in when we showed up at the scheduled time.Pool- The pool was crowded. At the Hilton, we needed to provide a towel card each time we wanted a towel and you were only able to get one miniature sized towel that didn’t even cover half the beach chair. If you lost your towel cards you would be charged a fee. At Outrigger the towels were big and plentiful. The attendant had no gripes about handing out additional towels. There are no floats, toys or balls allowed in the pool area. One morning my kids were at the pool the second it opened, they were the only ones there and they still were yelled at for bringing a small ball into the pool area. Beach- The Outrigger offers complimentary beach toys and boogie boards. Hilton charged a fee to rent these items. Lagoon- This was a great place for the kids to hang out. We rented the aqua bikes for the lagoon, which was fun. Also a great place to paddleboard, snorkel and play around in the water.Hotel Service was not very good. I called the front desk a few times and had to wait very long periods of time for a response and was transferred to several people. I was hung up on several times. We tried to go see the outdoor movie which was scheduled for 6pm. By 6:30 there was still no one to be found and no movie showing so we just left.Location- The Hilton Hawaiian Village was more secluded than the Outrigger, which is in the heart of Waikiki. Shopping is plentiful. Many ABC stores are close by with groceries or extras if necessary. The ABC store is a great place to stock up on water since it is not included in your stay. I would also recommend getting a boogie board or floats here for your stay rather than renting them. Ends up being less expensive.Restaurants- The nachos at Tropics were great and the view wonderful. A great place to watch the sunset. We did not wait for a table and dined on the patio by the beach. Restaurants at the Hilton Hawaiian Village are expensive (more expensive than Outrigger). It was $10 for a beer at Hilton and $7 at Outrigger. $7 for a coffee at Starbucks. Although the Dairy Queen offers an affordable alternative. Lappert’s ice cream was phenomenal. Possibly the best ice cream I have ever had.We would not stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village again. There are so many great options in the area and after staying at the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort and getting the royal treatment there, I would not choose the Hilton Hawaiian Village.","April 1, 2019"
It was our first trip to Hawaii and I must say the Hotel was beautiful. The surrounding pools and beaches were the best. The cost of food was out of this word. We did find a McDonalds and I hop that was within walking distance .,"March 31, 2019"
"For this being a resort not enough items are included for free for the price they charge. No free luau, beach chairs or umbrellas or any activities period. Getting a uber is also a task from the hotel ","March 31, 2019"
"The best place to stay in Oahu! The biggest hotel outside US mainland. Stayed here for 6 days with my wife as we celebrate our babymoon!The village is packed with shops/stores and superrr friendly staff!We stayed at the Rainbow Tower (highly recommended) and upgraded to an Oceanview/Oceanfront room. It was totally worth it!!! Amazing views, waking up to clear view of the ocean and diamond head!Staff are so friendly too! When in Oahu, choose Hilton Village Waikiki, we are definitely coming back when our baby turns 1! ","March 31, 2019"
Pros...Best beach area in Waikiki and lots of nice pools etc. Reasonable (Waikiki standards of reasonable) rates for being right on the beach. Excellent breakfast buffet.Cons...Lots of crowds and noise. Like all unionized resorts in Hawaii you’ll meet some of the surly and incompetent employees they can’t get rid of. That excellent breakfast buffet is $40 a head!Overall a great family spot with lots to do and right on the beach and walking distance to the rest of Waikiki and the Ala Moana Mall.,"March 31, 2019"
Perfect for families especially.nothing but great things to say about the place.not for those on a budget however.know that the resort fee of $40+ dollars and another $40 is added for parking if you have a rental car plus taxes add up to over $100 dollars a night to the original room.,"March 31, 2019"
"We had a terrible experience when we stayed at the rainbow tower. We went on a beach around 10:30 in the morning. We were not able to find a good spot for our stuff right away, so, we temporarily put our clean towels, purses, etc. on one of the surfboards. Suddenly, a rude (under the management of Mr. Earl) guy who was one of the incharged of the surfboard rental/lesson, he came towards me in and angry look, he picked up our clean towels, purses and other things, AND threw them away. What a terrible person, a worker, or a surfboard trainor he was, I would say! I thought of myself that was not deseving to be part of your resort as a worker. Anyway, Good luck to this person! I wish, he would not do the same to the future guests!","March 30, 2019"
"Our room was in the Diamond Head tower. While it was very spacious for a hotel on Waikiki, it was in serious need of renovation. The carpet had almost certainly been there since the early 90s. Nice large balcony, though. Every night there is outdoor entertainment which you can absolutely hear in the room until about 10:30pm. Terrible mattresses; very lumpy. Because it is a ""village"" with condos etc. as part of the huge complex, there are always - literally always- hoards of people in and around the buildings that you must weave through. Parking is far away, expensive and inconvenient. The pools are very standard and too small given the massive size of the property. Always crowded. Use pool towel cards so each person is only allowed one pool towel at a time. If you want a quite oasis or any feeling of ""tropical paradise,"" definitely choose another hotel.","March 30, 2019"
"This property needs some updating (carpet, USB plug ports etc) also better signage to help you navigate your way around. The staff is extremely friendly & helpful! Especially, Edith our fifth floor room Housekeeper! She made the stay more pleasant with her friendliness and outstanding job of cleaning and working around our schedule. The view of the oven and lagoon from the Rainbow your was incredible. You should pay for the upgrade! There is plenty to do onsite. Restaurant choices were ok, the ice cream at Lapperts is a must. ","March 30, 2019"
Everything was beautiful and the staff was very friendly. We enjoyed our vacation very much and would definitely stay here again. My only disappointment was we couldn't use the pool in our tower because it was for adults only and we had our 14 year old granddaughter with us.,"March 30, 2019"
I’ve seen the Rainbow Tower on TV and in Magazines. Well we finally got to stay there. Fantastic location and facilities. So much to see and do. Plenty of places to eat and shop. Walking distance to Ala Moana shopping centre. Great place for couples or families. ,"March 29, 2019"
This is our 4th visit to the Ali’i Tower at Hilton Hawaiian Village. We adore this hotel and always have an amazing time. My kids especially love the Ali’i Pool. The view from our ocean view room was phenomenal!!,"March 29, 2019"
"If you want big resort experience this is it. Lovely setting and pools. Extremely crowded, touristy, hard to get electors, pools full, expensive but fine restaurants. Rainbow tower view was nice on ocean but very loud in the early morning as they graded the lagoon sand. Room was quiet though if you closed the patio door. But stuff at ABC Stores isafforadble and easy. Starbucks has crazy long lines. ","March 29, 2019"
"Beautiful property, close to airport and cruiser port. Check in took alittle long but the staff was kind and gave good information. We Upgraded to ali'i which was a great idea. Defintely would recommend. Rooms are nice , bathroom is beautiful. However the elevator was very slow even at night. I appreciated the proximity to everything at the ali'i tower. I still have on my bracelet it is cute! Newer movies in ther DVD rental would have been cool. Hotel is right on the beach and you can easily walk to their mall and restaurants about 5-10 min walk. Hilton really makes it so you dont have to leave the resort for anything...they have whatever you need! ","March 28, 2019"
"We stayed in the Tapa tower in a suite on floor 27. We had to lanai's. One facing the ocean which is incredible and the other in the bedroom facing the side of the building but you can still see the ocean. The best part of this view is when they have the fireworks on Friday nights. We just watched is from our lanai and not have to deal with fighting the crowds from the ground level. Fantastic! The beach is just a few yards away as well as the man made lagoon. Very convenient.. They strongly encourage you to check out via text and leave the keys in your room. We received 2 phone calls to do so and so we did. Very easy. The only issue I had was the room and decor was so old and the trash cans were so elongated, you couldn't really fit any trash in them. Other than that, we had a great time.","March 28, 2019"
The hotel is in some places not well maintained and needs a fresh coat of paint.The room is clean but outdated especially the bathroom has seen better days. Check in was really slow. For one night it's ok but wouldn't book it again.,"March 28, 2019"
"A lovely location, right next to the beach. The complex was very busy and for first timers confusing and chaotic. There was a lack of sign posts directing you to any given place. Given a room in Diamond Head tower, while very spacious and clean, was rather tired with paint chipped off the woodwork. The room overlooked the resort but the veranda was in shade the whole day. We had to ask every day for tea bags as coffee was the only drink left in the room. Having said that, the staff were very helpful and always obliged. I would not rate this 4*","March 27, 2019"
"Yearly I come to Hawaii and always stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, this year is no exception. I booked a room in the Ali Tower Room 1526 (Thank You David!) I checked in and was greeted by Kehau, she remebered me from last year and greeted me with a big smile and hug. I cannot find fault in anything at teh hotel. My room was spotless and the housekeeper (didnt get her name) kept it clean and spotless. I had view of Super Pool. I did use the private pool in the Alit Tower, the attandant was very friendly and helped me pick a great shair for maximum sun. I had drinks at the Tropics and a few breakfasts.This is a very large hotel, but all works well. I highly recommond this hotel and esp recommond the Ali Tower.","March 26, 2019"
"We stayed in the Ali’i Tower. All the staff were lovely, super helpful and welcoming. The room was nice if a bit crowded for 3 people. Not bad though if the point of the room is just a place to sleep. Pluses: comfy bed, very clean, friendly staff. Minuses: Playstation for watching videos (available from a kiosk in the lobby) is worthless. The equipment was buggy and the available DVDs are in poor condition. After two tries we gave up. Seems like the tech is overdue for an upgrade. We also had a tub that didn’t want to drain, but that was fixed by maintenance. Overall the resort is well maintained and was very pleasant. There’s always sticker shock on the cost of food and sundries, but that’s just Hawai’i. For first time visitors just plan to spend more than you’re ready for. ","March 26, 2019"
"I proposed 41 years ago here in Waikiki beach. Have not been back since so we came back for our 40th. to renew vows on the beach with our two kids and families, 10 of us. The grandkids aged 6-12 enjoyed as much as us. Thanks for a memorable anniversary .","March 26, 2019"
"I stayed at Rainbow tower and location can’t be better. Make sure you book a room facing diamond head side. My room was facing lagoon/Ala Moana beach side, not bad at all but wish it was the other side. Every room has a balcony.","March 26, 2019"
"This hotel is absolutely amazing. It has 5 towers and it is literally a village within itself. It has numerous pools, it’s right on the beach, it has shopping on site, it has bars and restaurants. It is just amazing.","March 26, 2019"
"We stayed here with two kids under the age of 10. They did not complain one time about being bored or unsatisfied. There are many pools attached to this venue, and they are all impeccably designed. They are clean and the staff are attentive. there are several bars located around the area for the adults who want to just unwind. there is shopping and decent food in the venue. The prices are probably over inflated for the food, but it is a hotel so you can't expect too much more. There are convenient stores located around the area, which are very handy to stock-up your fridge for a late night snack or a drink. Starbucks and another coffee shop are located on the premises. Note for all our Australian travellers, the coffee and the food is American standard, so don't expect to be too satisfied with the coffee or the food. i know our American friends enjoy the coffee, but us Australians (especially the melbourne comers) will not find a good coffee any where in America. The rooms are clean, and decently sized. I believe all rooms have a balcony. not a smokers friendly location. But in saying that, Hawaii is not very smokers friendly. I know this smoke free venue will entice most of you. But for the smokers (who are equally human with their own rights and expectation of not being discriminated against) will find Hawaii in general a challenging, but the positive, you'll smoke less. Just don't expect to enjoy a smoke with your drink. All that said, over all this place is perfect. I know in the heading i said ""kid Friendly"", but that does not discount the fact that the place is perfect for couples or lone travellers. If i were to return to Hawaii with just my partner and no kids, i would stay at this place. Only thing i would avoid is the pool with the slide, that pool has a LOT of kids around it for obvious reasons. we did not get breakfast with out package, but as mentioned above, there are plenty of eateries around the complex that serve up decent food (large proportions). you can't go wrong with this place.","March 25, 2019"
"This resort is beautiful. We stayed in the grand islander tower. Had a beautiful view and a beautiful room. The resort has so much to do. Places to shop, swim, eat and drink! All the people we encountered were nice. We would most definitely stay at this resort again. The only downfall is they don’t clean the room every day. And there’s always a lot of sand and trash. And no way to clean the counters unless you go but your own cleaning spray. There is also a lot of walking in the resort, not a bad thing though. ","March 25, 2019"
This resort is too big for our personal liking. Multiple towers makes meeting up with friends very complicated. Hotel rooms outdated- definitely do not prefer carpeted rooms while on the beach. Food/drinks at hotel good but overpriced. Spent most meals off property. Pools nice but did not seem heated. Also beach in front of resort extremely crowded. Must purchase lawn chairs if you want one on the beach. Grounds kept up beautifully.,"March 25, 2019"
"The Hilton Village has it all. We thoroughly enjoyed having onsite ABC, Starbucks and plenty of gift shops to fit your every need.The beach is just steps away. I appreciated having poolside food/drink service. The prices are higher but what you’d expect staying at a resort in Hawaii. The rooms are spacious with your own personal fridge and stunning views of the beach. I also enjoyed the onsite gym with free weights through 100lbs, ellipticals, stairmasters, bikes, and treadmill. Fantastic resort. ","March 24, 2019"
"We spent 2 nights at the HHVW in March. Several towers, dining options, stores, etc. comprise the resort. People everywhere. There are fireworks on Friday evenings, check times. ABC Store has lots of varied options. We found the resort to be clean (important for us). One night was a Norwegian cruise line pre-stay for Pride of America. Be sure to get directions to their check in area, it is a bit confusing.","March 24, 2019"
"My mom, two boys (ages 3&6) stayed at the Tapa tower in March 2019 for a much needed sunny vacation. The hotel grounds are elegant, well kept and just off the beach where you can take lovely walks enjoying the beautiful sunset. As well there is an extremely convenient bus route that runs right in front of the hotel and several hotel onsite “ABC” general stores too. We enjoyed so much about this hotel including the coi ponds, morning yoga and beautiful “partial ocean views” form the balcony. Here are some areas I think could be improved upon:- the pools at each tower locations were ridiculously cold, and it seemed to me, that with exception to the Paradise Pool area - there were no other hot tubs! I thought that we’d spend much of our holiday swimming and lazing about the pool.... we did not do this at all as it was simply too cold and therefore not enjoyable. I’d recommend that the pools are heated a few degrees warmer, and that each location includes a hot tub. The resort fee seems excessive particularly when you don’t enjoy the facilities -there are no recycling blue bins in the rooms and overall the hotel seems to generate a huge amount of plastic waste serving- staff at mandara spa do not seem to answer the phone. After trying to book an appointment 4 days in a row, I walked over to the spa and spoke to spa reception to make an appointment. It was not busy and so I’m not sure why they did not answer their phones?!- lagoon grill restaurant (located at paradise pools location) served terrible and horrendously expensive processed food. We paid $100 USD for nachos (with processed cheese), a salad and two hot dogs. We were not impressed. While our server was very kind, the food was terrible.","March 24, 2019"
"The resort was comfortable with beautiful views and all the shopping you need. The cocktails were good and reasonably priced. The Starbucks line gets really long though, so get there early for coffee. The four pools are nice too. I highly recommend this resort. Mahalo!","March 23, 2019"
"Great resort! Always find the sun from multiple pools and a great beach! Great restaurants, shops and bars to walk around and see. Close walk to Ala Moana Mall, restaurants and shops outside the resort. We stayed in the Grand Waikikian Tower and had a City View King Suite. Great room! ","March 23, 2019"
"We regularly come to Hawaii and make a stop on Oahu. We have been to several different hotels but have never had a problem going back to HHV. The location for us is ideal as it’s close enough to walk to Waikiki and far enough away from the busy strip. We have stayed in the Lagoon, Ali and Diamond towers and this time stayed in the Tapa and were very happy with our unit and floor. We noticed recent reviews about the pools being colder and I would say that it did seem that way. However when it is warm you will appreciate it and also they were much less crowded. Resort has a nice 24 hour gym. Self parking is very easy and convenient. For Friday fireworks we watch from the beach just past the Tropics Bar by the Port Hilton. It is a fantastic view and less crowded and you can enjoy the sunset before the fireworks. During our recent trip we had an issue that we felt we were treated unfairly and we mentioned it to the Manager on duty. She was very respectful and understanding and to our surprise on checkout, the resort gave us a credit. We are very thankful for the way the resort treats their guests. ","March 23, 2019"
"Your locationHilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Booked an ocean view room but the football field sized parking garage that you have to look at over your balcony to get the ocean view is beyond HIDEOUS. For 300 a night you cannot get a simple cup of coffee that you can even get in a motel 6...lol how is that possible in a resort. The coffee maker in the room does not work, it spits a few ounces out and stops. They sent a new one and it does the same thing. The Starbucks in the lobby is terrible, I would know because we are from Seattle. There are no restaurants at this hotel or anything else besides the lone Starbucks. So no enjoying a good morning coffee on the balcony. This hotel is the only one with an adult pool but it is also the only one without a bar so no ""adult"" beverages while enjoying the pool, another mind boggling annoyance. The room was just ok, I would say it's less than most normal mainland brand name hotels. Furniture was scuffed and scraped to the point of bare wood. After arrival we waited two hours to have our bathroom exhaust fan changed with a new one because it didn't work. This was for a 33rd anniversary celebration which was noted on the reservations but not one person made an effort to make it special for us. There is literally no one representing this resort located in this hotel, you have to walk over to a different hotel to talk to someone. So I give this resort an epic fail for our experience. Huge disappointment that I will not forget. Probably a great place for parents with kids but definitely not adults. We had room 2047, the other hotels are probably much better and at minimum you can get food or a drink in those. DO NOT STAY IN THE KALIA TOWER.","March 22, 2019"
"Simply put, the property is too big to be relaxing or convenient. It is obviously preferred by families because of its large pool and protected beach, but it is extremely crowded and chaotic. Every amenity requires a long walk, and getting off the property takes a bit of work. Whatever you choose to do, expect crowds and lines.1. Checking in is a disaster. There are seven towers, each a full hotel in its own right, and only one central check-in. The lines are always long (40-60 people) at check-in time, and often takes as much as 90 minutes or more. 2. Pool towel situation is awful. Guests get one card to trade for one cheap, small, white beach towel, that doesn't come close to covering the large lounge chairs. Every guest around the pool had indentations across their bodies because of the chair materials imprinting into their skin. The tip: When you trade your towel in for a fresh one, just lie and tell them you tossed 2-3 in the discard bin so they give you more.3. No laundry facilities. How can a place that caters to families not have a laundry facility (like the Marriott and several others do)? So they can gouge you for dry cleaning services. The nearest laundromat is a few blocks away, but that's not as close as it sounds.4. They charge extra to receive FedEx packages. The don't have a mail center, so they send it to a 3rd party business in one of the towers, which charges you to pick up the package. I've never had to pay to receive a hotel delivery in my life, in any country. Worse, they are releasing your package without your authorization to a third-party business. FedEx only tracks it to the hotel, not the outside business, so there's a higher chance for it to get lost.5. Rooms (in Rainbow tower) had terrible water pressure and took 5 minutes to get warm. The toilet didn't flush well, and the room AC ran all night (in spite of it being set to Auto). I will say the beds were comfortable, although some of the pillows stank of mildew. The maid service was very good, however.6. The onsite restaurants varied in quality, but most were expensive. There is a Starbucks in at least two of the towers, but the line at the one in the Diamond Head tower typically backed up and had a 20-30 minute wait. 7. Friday night fireworks were nice but they only lasted 3 minutes, so get there early or you'll miss it. 8. The staff was friendly, but they all seemed very tired and overburdened by the size of the place. We like our bartenders at the Paradise Lounge a lot.","March 22, 2019"
"We have stayed at this hotel for 19 years...our son was 2 when we first enjoyed it.A massive resort with family touch.

"The price was steep for this resort. As with most resorts, they nickle and dime you on everything. Rooms were dated and in poor condition. Service was great, though, as was the pool area and convenience to the beach/tourist sites. This wouldn't dissuade me from staying at Hilton properties in the future, but I would probably not stay at this particular location again.","March 21, 2019"
Resort is very nice we started at a different tower for the first half and it was great no issue just a bit older. We then upgraded to the Ali’ Tower which is a good amount more per night and although the room itself was nice and upgraded the view was horrible and basically sat outside the hotel loading zone. I’m sorry but why pay the upgrade for partial view of beach to have a full view of traffic and noise??? Unacceptable if you ask me. I included some pictures of the view and most would agree this is not worth the additional money and not what you want to see and hear on vacation. If anything this should be discounted rate room. ,"March 21, 2019"
"The hotel room was in the kalia tower which was at the end of the property and is mostly used for time share stays and so the paint is peeling, the refrigerator is in the bathroom and the bed are super uncomfortable. It’s hard to find chairs to use by the pool and to rent them is really expensive considering the resort fee they charge. While staff was friendly this place is a fail in my book. They should attend to the maintenance and maybe add a wave pool or lazy river and more lounge chairs. ","March 21, 2019"
 We were in Hawaii for my husband‘s 50th birthday and it was amazing. I really enjoyed waking up to the sunset with the Oceanview was amazing. The front desk were excellent. Every morning when we would go out for the day we were greeted with good morning Mr. and Mrs. and we enjoyed that they remembered our names. I can’t wait to get back to Hawaii next year. ,"March 21, 2019"
"Chose to stay at this property on our most recent Hawaiian holiday. The room was excellent and the view of diamond head superb. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower which was right on the beach. Overall a pleasant stay. The only criticism that I would make is that our flight from Australia landed very early in the morning. Before travelling, I received an offer of an early check in for an extra fee. I jumped at this chance as the opportunity to get straight into the room and shower was very appealing. When we arrived we were told that our room was not ready yet and we would be contacted when it was. I mentioned the offer and was told that check in time is 3:00pm and if the room was not ready by 2:00pm (I think) that I would not be charged. We went and had breakfast and a stroll and then checked on the room only to be told still not ready. I informed the concierge not to worry about the early check in as we were going for a walk and getting in at 2 is no different at this stage than waiting till 3. I was not expecting to get straight into the room until it was offered. My opinion in this is that if you cannot deliver on your offer then do not offer it. There was nothing in the original email to say it was conditional on the room being ready.","March 21, 2019"
"The Alii Tower at the Hilton Village Waikiki was fabulous = great views, the best location, very helpful staff, especially ""Claire"" at the main check-in desk with her professional handling of our arrangements, ""Daniel"" in that same main lobby area was fab!, ""Taylor"" in IT was very helpful with our internet issues, ""Carissa"" in the CRAZY SHIRTS shop was delightful, and ""Alex"" at the water sports / paddle board / water bike rental hut was extremely helpful and accommodating!

I could never recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. They are trying to optimise the return of investment by not renewing the facilities. I guess that the facilities are 20-40 years old and have not been renewed. The breakfast was not good and the drinks at the pool bar were far to expensive and not good.The only positive comment I have of the hotel is it's good location. It is well located and fairly close to Waikiki.,"March 20, 2019"
Beautiful Views of the mountains ⛰ to my left and ocean and beach to my right. Room was clean upon arrival. My only issue was housekeeping only came once to clean our room and never came back our entire stay. Had to call daily for clean towels. ,"March 20, 2019"
"As a former resident who has returned to Hawaii many times, I can honestly say that this was my best week ever. Our corner room in the Rainbow Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was spectacular. We had two lanais, one facing Diamond Head, the other facing the ocean. Friday night fireworks were at eye-level. The pools and restaurants were all amazing. Although we are far from it, we were treated like royalty all week.","March 20, 2019"
"The place is huge and bustling with people and excitement! We stayed on the 8th floor of the Tapa Tower and our room was very clean and the housekeeping service was excellent! Everything is Hawaii is very pricey, so you might as will expect to spend some bucks! The pools are beautiful and clean. The pool side bars have great drinks, excellent service, and delicious bar food, but here again expect to spend a lot of bucks! Overall we had a wonderful experience, and I long to go back...","March 20, 2019"

"Do you like large resort hotels?Do you like hotels with multiple towers?Do you like walking distances to get to different pools?Are you ok with walking a bit or taking a bus to get to the popular places in Honolulu?If you answer yes to any of these, then you'll probably have a good time at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. To say it is large is an understatement - it is a massive property and houses normal towers of varying degrees of refurbishment, towers of timeshare properties, multiple swimming pools, a lagoon, a conference center, shopping, restaurants, beach, etc. You never actually have to leave the property, but you probably should. Why? Honolulu is full of other things to eat and see and to get the best experience you should leave the property. With that said, if you like to stay on property only, then personally I prefer Disney's Aulani instead since it feels a bit nicer, but you'll probably also be paying a premium for that. We stayed in the lagoon tower, which has great views of the ocean and beach from one side and the coast/lagoon from the other. The rooms themselves are a little dated and probably need to be updated soon, but they aren't the oldest rooms we've stayed in. They actually felt very similar to the Waikoloa Village property which is undergoing its own renovation right now.While there is more to do than at the Waikoloa Village, at least the Waikoloa Village had a train and boat to get to different areas of the property. Here you'll just have to walk, but at least you can do what everyone else does and walk past the Louis Vuitton store, straight to the multiple ABC stores on property.For some reason pools in Hawaii always seem to feel too cold to me, and the Hilton Hawaiian Village wasn't an exception. I suppose that with the temperature most of the year being warm and the sun beaming down, it would be a colossal waste of energy to heat the pools, but it just help encourage use of the beach and lagoon. Hey, you're in Hawaii, go to the beach and enjoy!With all that said, I thought our stay was ok. I'd probably opt for something more center-Waikiki if we came back, or like I said, go to Aulani again, where we could get free childcare all. day. long. Unless of course I want a DQ Blizzard or LV Bag. Because the Hilton Hawaiian Village has those.","March 19, 2019"
"I organised my birthday in Hawaii at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We had 5 rooms in total. All the bookings had comments with the list of people asking if we could be close together. One room was on level 5; three were on level 17; one was on level 24. I don't consider that close.I chose this hotel because it had multiple pools and water slides which they boast about. The pools were nice. Some of the water slides were closed and they really are only for children.They have a lagoon where you can rent SUP and aqua bikes. The problem is people also swim in the lagoon making it difficult and dangerous to use the aqua bikes.The rooms in the Tapa Tower were very old looking. They were large and had balconies, but are in need of updating. In one of the rooms there was tape around the window (not sure why).","March 19, 2019"
My son and I came here to do some SCUBA diving off the island. First I would like to point out I am a Hilton Honors Gold member. We just arrived off a 6 hour flight and stood in line for 45 minutes to get checked in. That's bad enough but I was in the Priority line due to my gold status. So it was completely unacceptable. What made me more angry was I could see the front desk staff just joking around and in no kind of hurry at all to get people checked in. They get paid by the hour so why should they care if you have to wait in line for 45 minutes. The room was nice the breakfast was super expensive. My son and I had the buffet breakfast ( some fruit and scrambled eggs) and it was $75.00 don't get me wrong I don't mind spending money but I have to feel like I got a good value. I did not with the breakfast. Friday night they had a firework display that was very nice.,"March 19, 2019"
"Wonderful location and close to Ala Moana Mall. One walks out the door & voila, the Pacific Ocean with breathtaking sunsets. We've stayed here about five (5) times and sent my daughter here for her wedding; she & hubby enjoyed Paradise on earth ! ","March 19, 2019"
decided to go with a friend for a spontaneous weekend! the hotel was clean and everyone was helpful and friendly. perfect location right on the water. our room was very clean and had a wonderful view!,"March 19, 2019"
"Nice size rooms in rainbow tower, large village so everything is there if you didn’t want to leave, bit of a walk if you want to be right in the heart of Waikiki, we had to catch buses everyday to get back with all our shopping which was the only downside. So if you plan on a lot of shopping you might want to pick somewhere closer like Outrigger, Hilton ect.","March 19, 2019"
"We traveled to Hilton Waikiki Village Hotel for a part pleasure/part business trip. This sprawling campus was the site to an international educators' conference. The layout is kind of confusing with many conference events in different buildings. The lagoon, advertised online to look pristine and enjoyable, was dried up and the water was foggy. We did not have enough time to enjoy amenities like paddleboarding. We found the hotel crowded with tourists.","March 19, 2019"
"We had awesome views and close to a lot of great restaurants, shopping, boat slips, and its right on the beach. The place itself is older with limited updates. We could smell mold/wetness both times we stayed here. Not a bad place but not upscale by any means.","March 19, 2019"
"I have stayed at the HHV many, many times for business trips over the years but never as a vacation option. To say I am a bit jaded with this property is an understatement. However, my other half had never been to Oahu and I thought an immersion into the chaos of Waikiki would explain why I like Kauai more. We arrived at the HHV valet and were promptly greeted and welcomed. We were booked into the Alii tower (info gleaned from staying here before) meaning we skipped the chaos of the main lobby and went directly to the Alii check-in. We were warmly greeted at the Alii tower check-in and recognized as AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) guests. We were personally greeted by the concierge who escorted us to our room and went over the property and our AMEX FHR benefits. We were also given wrist bands (braided friendship bracelets) which gave us priority line access at Tropics Bar. Our room was quite nice though there were some minor dings and dents on the furnishings. We were on the tenth floor in room A1004 ocean front with a great view of the beach and Diamond Head. The bathroom was large with a separate water closet with a magic ToTo toilet complete with heated seat!! The bed was firm, and we found the pillows to be too soft. We definitely heard hallway noise especially people slamming doors. For the life of me, I will never understand why people slam their hotel room doors. Additionally, we could hear people opening and closing their balcony sliding door. The balcony was fantastic for watching the Friday night fireworks!As AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts guests we had breakfast included in our stay. Tropics Bar & Grill was our designated breakfast spot. We really enjoyed breakfasts there and our wristbands got us head of the line every morning. However, as much as we enjoyed breakfast at Tropics our attempt to have drinks around sunset were marred by an employees’ union demonstration. The noise was intolerable for enjoying a drink and conversation. The protesters complete with bullhorns and drums made so much noise that we quickly left our table before we even had a chance to order. We ended up at the Tapa Bar which turned out to be a lot of fun and we got to know Randy our bartender!We tried to utilize the Alii pool but unless you get up at the crack of dawn and “reserve” chairs then you are out of luck. There once was a large hot tub but it is now filled in with dirt and plants and been replaced with a free-standing hot tub you could buy at Home Depot. The hot tub was full of kids and the water was green. We gave up and went to the beach and just rented two beach chairs ($18 each) and umbrella ($36) for $70 total. I recommend if we must spend the money to enjoy the beach then the HHV should at least send bar servers out to us! This is one area I would recommend HHV improve. We went looking for snacks but found the Wiki Wiki Market line was out the door. We tried to get sodas, snacks and sunscreen at the Whalers General Store, but they were CLOSED during lunch time! Seriously made this an inconvenience since it is close to the beach. Who closes a store in a mega resort for lunch when that is when people want snacks etc.!?! We finally just ordered food from the pool bar, but we had to go order and wait for it at the bar.The HHV is crowded. There are lines for everything. We tried to get coffee at Starbucks but the line at both locations were ridiculous. There once was a nice bar in the main lobby which has now been replaced by a make your own flip flop merchant and the crowded main lobby has a coffee bar where once there was seating. A walk around the property is quite lovely but the throngs of people moving around means you are more likely dodging people and not really enjoying your walk. We found having a car was convenient, so we could get out and about from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. Note that to valet or self-park your car at the HHV costs more than it does to rent it per day.Overall, we had a good 4 star stay, but we didn’t spend much time on property other than the little time we spent at the beach. If we return, we will book the Alii tower again because the Alii front desk team were wonderful and helpful.","March 19, 2019"
Initially disappointed with room - thought it was dated but found out room decor didn't matter ! The room was clean and functional and for all the time you spend in it as there is a beautiful wee village right outside...hotel really lives up to its name !! Right on the beach with a few pools and plenty food places and bars within hotel grounds. I'm cannot recommend this place enough ! Hopefully get back there soon !,"March 19, 2019"
I love this property. So many choices of things to do right at the resort. The condo apartments are beautiful and very relaxing with beautiful views of either the city or the ocean. Lots of activities to do and great restaurants through out the property,"March 19, 2019"
Stayed in a junior suite in the Tapa tower. Massive rooms with a great view. Could do with an update. Most things seem to be from 80’s or 90’s. Lots of facilities in the resort and heaps to do. Probably 15-20 min walk from centre of Waikiki. Can be a positive or negative depending on what you like.,"March 19, 2019"
"Great location. Huge property and even though we did not like our room as it was outdated and old (avoid the Tapa Tower) this is why they are way cheaper. We did love the beach, it is bigger than other properties, well maintained. The lagoon and the pools are excellent, specially if you are traveling with children.I said that it is like a mini-Disneyland because there are so many activities, shops, restaurants, etc that you will never get bored. If we go back to Waikiki, we would probably stay there again but in another tower. Also, kudos to the front desk staff as we made a reservation with Priceline and somehow our reservation was not showing on Hilton's system, the front desk worked on it and followed up until they made sure we were taken care of. Great experience with customer service.","March 18, 2019"
"Massive hotel with service that is lacking. Rooms were old and dusty....disgusting actually (pic attached).As a gold member and comparing to other Hilton properties / services, they have no executive lounge, no complimentary breakfast, no upgrade and coupon to exchange for bottled water which you have to pick up, plus the line up to check-in is long.I am also Sheraton / Marriott gold and complained about the difference in treatment, the staff said he used to work there and Hilton is a step lower alluding to stick with the Marriott chain. Complained to the manager and comparing my experiences at the other Hiltons, she told me to read the policies and she cannot do anything when other Hiltons don't follow policy.This hotel is not cheap and I don't mind paying providing the service and quality is there too.Definitely won't be back.","March 18, 2019"
 Service was excellent though the price was expensive the firework show was unbelievable the resort view was good we stayed at the Diamondhead tower and the room would have been perfect if it had a small microwave.,"March 17, 2019"
"We stayed at this property for the first time. We were impressed with the room in the Rainbow tower and our view right down the beach and at the property. We had a great view of the fireworks from our balcony. Valet parking is expensive but well serviced. We went to three restaurants all of which were very good and Bali was excellent. There were several other restaurants on the property and the ABC store that we sometimes bought take out and ate on our balcony. Overall, I recommend this property.","March 17, 2019"
This is one of the worst hotels in the hilton line.very crowded rooms are very oldfurniture looks like it’s from the thrift shopi supposedly stayed in the nicest toweri am afraid to see the othersthe staff was nicethe beach was pretty the spa was very nice,"March 17, 2019"
"Our family has stayed here twice. We have made priceless memories. There are many ways to keep the children excited and entertained as well as the adults. There are multiple pools on site, including one with slides as well as the ocean and a lagoon. Many on site places to eat. Walking distance (or a quick Uber) to shops, restaurants and other entertainment.","March 17, 2019"
"We went to Hawaii to celebrate my daughter’s 40th birthday! We enjoyed the hotel, lagoon, and the fireworks. We did the paddle board, snorkeled and watched the wonderful fireworks show. One of my favorites was the Spirit of Aloha catamaran sunset cruise. We ended up seeing so many whales and the crew of Mash, Corinne and Lisa took very good care of us! They,are our cruise very enjoyable!","March 17, 2019"
We have traveled to Oahu 8 times now and this is where we stay. The beach is beautiful and there is a good choice of dining on property. Friday night fireworks are amazing. You are walking distance from shopping and nightly entertainment.,"March 17, 2019"
"It's been a while since we've stayed at the Kalia Tower.The suite was very clean, comfortable, and provided the ideal staycation location for the Honolulu Festival activities.We expect the best in accommodations at HGVC and are never disappointed.","March 17, 2019"
"This was our second visit in 7 months... The resort is wonderful from the moment you arrive. The service is impeccable, the facilities second to none and the resort experiences such as entertainment, the lei making and unwell classes and the amazing firework display every single week are the icing on the cake. The pools are beautiful and spacious, the sand on the Hilton stretch of beach is clean and soft (unlike the rest of the beach which is very rocky) the ease of the towel service and hiring of beach facilities make it such an easy activity to enjoy. The huge amount of retail and hospitality shops in the resort mean that if you didn’t want to, you wouldn’t have to leave! It’s a fab location, only a short 10 minute walk into the centre of town and less to ala Moana (shopping!)... with its fantastic service this has now become our annual holiday destination.","March 17, 2019"
"Even though this complex is massive it’s very surreal. A lot of landscaping makes for beautiful photos. And most hotel rooms can look right out on the beach and the pools. We came in March so the water is kind of cool. It takes a little getting used to where you are but once you figure it out you can get around pretty easy. The Ali’s tower. The rooms are nice. Has lots of amenities. Mini fridge, pod coffee make and a hot water carafe, hair dryer, safe, a big screen tv and the biggest closet I have ever seen in a hotel room. Would definitely recommend. All rooms seem to have a balcony. ","March 16, 2019"
The Hilton Hawaiian village was a good hotel but I wouldn’t say great. The rooms are average and the decor is outdated. We were in the Tapa tower which is one of the cheaper towers. The hotel had plenty of pools to swim in and a lagoon that the kids loved which was the main reason we chose the hotel. It is on the beachfront which is fantastic and the kids loved the water slides. The hotel puts on fireworks every Friday night which is a drawcard but u can see the fireworks from plenty of other hotels or from the beach. The only disadvantage was that it’s right down the end of Waikiki. We enjoyed our stay but wouldn’t stay there again.,"March 16, 2019"
"Check in lines were 25+ minutes long. We waited only to find out we were in the A’li tower and had to go there - complete nightmare and a waste of one hour. No one cares - there are so many people there the staff makes it their job to make sure you know you don’t matter. Booked a room through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts for a trip for me and my daughter. There was a glitch with our reservation - it should have been easily resolved had the hotel bothered to help or offer a sliver of customer service. But they chose not to. Amex tried to help - to no avail. After sitting in the lobby for an hour (after a 30 minute wait online) we left for the Outrigger Waikiki. Our experience with the Hilton Hawaiian Village was awful. The place is so big - 7 towers. It’s clear they don’t value their guests, there’s always another tour bus on the horizon. I’m thankful the Outrigger had room for us. They were awesome. We shared our story and they took really good care of us. I would never, ever go back to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I’ve always enjoyed Hiltons - but not this time. ","March 15, 2019"
"The wide and I stayed at this hotel for 1 week as we got a great deal, this was our first stay at the HHV. Upon arrival to the hotel, we had to walk all the way to check in where the shuttle dropped us off which isn't too far but no help with luggage. Once we got to check in the agent was not friendly at all and did not speak with us unless she had to. She typed away and advised us of our room and sent us on our way. We came for our baby moon and anniversary and this was notes, but not even a welcome. We got to our room in the Tapa tower which was an ocean view and overall had a great view. The room itself was disappointing. It was clearly dated, dirty as dust was layered on the tables and TV stand. I called and asked if they could clean it on 3 seperate days and it never was. The washroom was okay, small but the towels were not great. The fridge was nice as it kept our beers and drinks extra cold. Bed overall was nice but it's hard trying to sleep as the doors slam so loud, not sure if it was just our area but seemed everyone slammed the doors plus the amount of light that gets into the room via the hallway was annoying. Maid service was good and was usually done whole we went to the pools and beach. The pools were nice and easy to get a spot but the pools were really cold, usually I don't complain cause I enjoy cold pools but this was way to cold. The beach was great and always could find a spot but $18 for chairs and 35 or so for an umbrella c'mon. They nickel and dime you for every thing. The resort fee alone is $50 of nothing, they claim it's worth over $120... Ahhh yea right it gets you nothing useful. The resort has tons of restaurants and ABC right in it which is the same price but the food places such as Round table, $30 for a medium, jist order dominos or other places to the room if you want pizza or walk out 5-10 minutes to a ton of places nearby. I went to the Tapa bar during happy hour, $6 beers $8 mai tais... Decent deal but plastic cups? Seriously you can't even give me a glass. As for security, anyone can use the pool, beach of course is public, but we saw families who were not staying at the reosrt using the pools and leaving and taking up space, It's pretty obvious, and no security to elevators or rooms. Would I come back? Unless i got an even better deal I would not. It's a great location but so many better options for the price. This is just a huge place","March 15, 2019"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a massive complex on the edge of Waikiki that feels a bit like Las Vegas but on the beach. And yes, as indicated in many reviews, there's thousands of rooms and therefore thousands of people. But I liked it much more than I expected because I went in with the right expectations. I was able to get personal service when I asked for it but it's not constantly on offer because of the sheer size of the place. I am not sure what people are expecting out of a hotel room but our city view Family Room was extremely spacious and pleasant with a fun view of the downtown core and the mountain range behind it. I didn't miss a pool or ocean view once because we don't hang out in our room besides sleeping and showering.I had every intent on managing my parking costs but decided to valet when I arrived because I had tired of dealing with driving in the heavy Honolulu traffic. And yes, $52 a night is steep but it was so pleasant to have the valet manage the parking while I enjoyed my vacation. This splurge was so worth it from a relaxation point of view and the valet staff is super pleasant.The complex had ample pools and we tried all of them that were accessible to us. All the pools were ice cold. As-in swimming in water from an arctic spring. This may be pleasant in the summer months but it royally sucked in early March. It didn't matter to our preteens but their parents never got into the water once. The hot tubs have a limit of 9 people and do not allow for anyone under 5 years old. These rules are completely ignored and I must have counted at least 9 5 year olds in the hot tub with another 20 people. It was crazy full, quite gross and unsafe yet the staff seems powerless to stop it. There are no lifeguards anywhere so watch your kids at all times. This wasn't difficult for me because 90% of the time there was nowhere to sit anyways so I walked the perimeter of the pool to kill the time.The ocean water was warmer and enjoyable yet still brisk in the morning. The Waikiki beach is soft for about 3 feet into the water and then the bottom turns into small, and sometimes sharp, rocks. I am bringing water shoes next time but it is manageable with bare feet. Enough waves for some timid boogie boarding. The $45 resort charge does NOT include any chairs on the beach. A couple of chairs and an umbrella will run you $70 per day. It's hard to defend this charge but it does mean chairs are available for those willing to pay. We're not a family that will sit on a beach all day so we did not indulge. The lagoon was chilly as well but the kids loved snorkeling in it. You can get equipment for $6 at the ABC store in the Tapa Tower. The prices for renting water toys at the lagoon are insane but plenty of people made use of them.Drinks around the resort are expensive which you can expect at $8-15 per drink. They do have happy hour specials which I appreciated. Mixed drinks were very inconsistent in quality.The food at the restaurants was not top quality but very decent for the amount of food that they put out. Like anywhere in Waikiki, food prices are very high which you'll have to factor into your budget.The hotel's website runs specials all the time which you should wait and hunt for. The specials won't show up anywhere but on the hotel's site, not even Hilton's booking tool will pull it up unless you have the sale code. There's substantial savings to be had here!If you prepare yourself for a big resort with lots of people and understand where the extra charges show up, you too can have a great time at this resort. Make sure you leave Waikiki and see the entire island!","March 15, 2019"
"Lovely hotel, great setting, poor concierge service - mis-information and hard to find the right people who knew details ( on kids club for example). Great facilities, pools, and lagoon - no life guards. ","March 14, 2019"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village was nice however not as nice as we expected. Your room quality will depend on the Tower you are assigned so ask about that when you check-in. We were in a tower that needed some work/upgrades. We found the hotel staff to be disinterested. Not actually rude however not particularly pleasant either. That was especially surprising. The hotel is right on the beach which is wonderful. We loved Tropics Bar & Grill. It's a huge place with everything you need right in the village so very convenient. We were also a bit surprised by the uncomfortable bed. Perhaps our expectations were too high however the bed was very hard, linen was ok but nothing particularly luxurious. Just a bit surprising. We had a king room which was very spacious and included a mini-fridge. Overall it's a great location and nice to have everything you need right in the village. Select a room in the Diamond Tower and I suspect you will find that more luxurious than the Tapas tower where we were placed. ","March 13, 2019"
"I'll start by saying I work in a Hotel and can look at things different, but I could not find fault in the Hilton Hawaiian, we stayed in the Hilton grand vacations tower in a 2 bedroom apartment, (room L660) it was huge, we were there for our 20th wedding anniversary, and the hotel staff went out of their way to decorate the room. very well presented, we had a lagoon view from the balcony.The hotel grounds are kept meticulous and the lagoon area is awesome (there are also small fish in the main lagoon!) a hint though, the paddle boards and aqua bikes are all quite expensive to hire (around $40 US for 1 hour), but 5 minutes away on the beach, they are cheaper.Shopping - we had been told that shopping is amazing in Hawaii.... We were underwhelmed, A La Moana shopping centre is huge, but the Aussie dollar when we went was crap but the factory outlet centre was awesome, worth the bus trip.We found Honolulu to be the Gold Coast on steroids, heaps of Japanese tourists, and they really cater for them. ","March 13, 2019"
"We enjoyed our 2 week stay in the Lagoon Tower using our HGVC points. Our 1 bedroom unit was very comfortable with a well equipped kitchen. I missed having a washer and dryer in our room but there were oversized washer and dryers on every floor with easy access. We loved the Friday night fireworks and there was always plenty of action to watch and enjoy from our balcony every evening. Things would quiet down after 10:00 so that was good. The only disappointment we had was that there wasn’t a adult pool or hot tub. The Lagoon pool’s lounge chairs were so tight I bruised my legs trying to maneuver my way through the rows. The main pool was much nicer but didn’t have a great view of the ocean. We ended up buying chairs at Walmart and hanging out on the beach most of our stay, which was wonderful! Loved seeing all the brides too!!Staff was wonderful and always helpful. The resort location was great and easy to get around Honolulu using Uber or walking. Plenty of places to eat within walking distance! ","March 13, 2019"
"Our stay has been really fantastic! From the location, service and cleanliness of the room is exceptional! Everyone is super friendly! Our first time in Hawai’i is memorable. Thank you Hilton for our great experience here! ","March 13, 2019"
"In Rainbow tower, ask for OCEANFRONT side vs ocean view. Pools not heated. Fireworks on Friday night, 15 min show. Food decent and expensive. Same with drinks. Fitness room open 24 hours. Two Starbucks. Rental car on site..but expensive. Nice if they had adults only pool.Alot of assertive pigeons on property. Big complex.","March 12, 2019"
"I booked a 3 night stay using my Chase points. The hotel grounds are nice but, unfortunately, due to personal reasons, we had to leave after the first night. Before we left though, I made sure to talk to the front office staff and Chase that I would get a refund for the two nights. That was about a month ago and the accounting/finance/billing office at this hotel is still unwilling to refund me for the 2 nights back to Chase. Chase and I have been calling for about 3 weeks now and they don't pick up the call and never return my voicemail. Chase did talk to the supervisor at the billing department once and she just told them that they needed to ""investigate"" whether they can approve the refund. What is there to investigate? You've already refunded me the resort fees and room upgrade fees for the two nights that were charged directly to my credit card! This is one of the worst experiences I've ever had with regard to getting a refund from a business. Avoid this place!","March 11, 2019"
My Husband and I booked our babymoon/honeymoon here. To say the least we were not impressed. For such an expensive hotel the service was mediocre. When we arrived to the room we had an ordinary room for our special occasion and the hotel kne we were celebrating. My husband informed the front desk again and they gave us two free cupcake tickets. Overall we had a disappointing and overpriced experience.,"March 11, 2019"
Hotel has many buildings. Getting coffee in the morning can be quite the walk. Maybe putting single cup pots in rooms would be a big help for those of us who need our coffee/tea in morning. Make sure to get a ocean view room. The views are spectacular.,"March 11, 2019"
"This was my second time staying at HHV but first time in the Ali'i Tower (king room).It was definitely nicer than the Tapa Tower, with its own private reception and perks.Our view was lovely, overlooking the Super Pool, however, there was construction going on in the room/s above ours and our friends and it was very noisy, especially when trying to get our 16mth old to nap (and their 14mth old). We raised our concerns with hotel management and they rectified the situation, offering new rooms and free buffet breakfasts. The pool temperature was a little above melted ice and as the weather wasn't as warm as anticipated, we preferred to swim in the lagoon instead which is amazing.The grounds are immaculate and all the staff are friendly and helpful.Food is expensive and Starbucks is at least 30% more at the 2 stores inside HHV than one outside so if you're planning on eating at the resort all the time be prepared to pay extra. The shrimp truck at the back of the lagoon is delicious.The day spa is also pricey (which is to be expected at a hotel) but very luxurious and well worth it. My fiancee and I had a couples massage as did the other couple we travelled with.The highlight of our visit to HHV was seeing Hawaii 5-0 being filmed next to the lagoon! We are avid watchers of the show and couldn't believe our luck. We loved our first family stay of many here and can't wait to make more memories next time.","March 10, 2019"
"Rainbow Tower a must upgrade. Great location to everything from beach to many stores for shopping. It really is a village! Just past the resort(within walking distance) is a strip with high end shopping from Prada to Burger King. Family oriented but still nice for couples. Charlie’s Taxi Service is perfect for shuttle from airport. One way, up to 4 people, is only $29 total. Waikiki is beautiful! ","March 10, 2019"
"We visit Waikiki twice a year but usually stay at the other end of Waikiki (closer to Diamondhead) Never again! This end of Waikiki and specifically this resort was wonderful. An expansive beach area and plenty of shopping and food options are right within the resort. It felt more secluded but The International Marketplace and Royal Hawaiian shopping centers are within walking distance. This was the first time in several years that we didn’t even want to leave this side of the island. The only thing I would say though is if you plan to go to the beach, bring your own beach towels as they were only giving out bath towels at the pool. As you would expect the hotel restaurants can be a little steep. All of the staff was excellent. Can’t wait to go back! ","March 9, 2019"
"Stayed with my parents in a 2-bedroom suite in the Grand Waikikian. Super quiet on one of the top floors with a beautiful view overlooking the ocean and many pools on the resort. Bed was decently comfortable. Shower was either too hot or lukewarm most of the time. The resort is so massive it can be frustrating to find where to go when you first get there. Between trying to find a place to park in the tight parking garage to dragging luggage up two different sets of elevators, we were exhausted. Once you finally get to explore the grounds, however, it becomes a lot easier to navigate. There are plenty of signs to direct you, and it's pretty difficult to get lost once you familiarize yourself with what's close by. I just wish the initial check-in was easier to navigate. Overall though, great location, lots to do in the area, and a quiet and relaxing suite.","March 8, 2019"
"Rainbow Tower had a great view of the bay. Close to resturant’s, bars, shopping, transportation, walking to the ocean and pools. Biggest drawback for me was trying to sleep at night; music was loud til 11:00 and I was needing more rest.","March 6, 2019"
"Visited for four days this month while attending a conference in Honolulu. Even in off-peak season this place was super crowded and there was always a wait. My room was in the Diamond Head Tower. It was pretty dated and not cleaned well. The bathtub had sand in it. Also, the tub had trouble draining each day and I found bugs in the bathroom. The room was resort-view and each morning at 5:30/6:00 am I could hear the aerobics class outside and then each night the loud music from the Tapa Bar was blaring until 10:30 or later. Probably the most concerning thing was that after my room was cleaned every day I found that the lock on the sliding balcony door was left unlocked. We waited 30-60 minutes to eat in every restaurant - even for breakfast - on property. I tried for Starbucks one day and even waited in long line there. Plus, I paid $17 for a latte and protein box. We learned quickly to eat away from the resort. Friday night there were fireworks on the beach and it was as if the entire island knew. The crowds were unbelievable. I questioned the safety on property. The beach in front of the hotel is public, so it was super crowded as well. And! $18 for a lounge chair. You’re already paying a huge resort fee and then they seem to nickel and dime you. That was disappointing. I will say that the staff all seemed pleasant and friendly. Clearly they are unionized, as they were wearing some sort of button that said “one job should be enough”. I get the sentiment, but it was distracting. Overall, it served its purpose, but I’d look for a different place to stay if I went back. ","March 6, 2019"
"Stayed in Kalia tower of Hilton Hawaiian village on Oahu. Bathroom plumbing flooded, room cold and given blankets since no heating exists and a/c or fan running cold even in winter. No concierge help if you are not eligible for timeshare sales pitch. Food and beverages overpriced and no reasonable prices specials. Had to go offsite and eat or cook in the room. Pools freezing, again no heat on this property. 2 hot tubs for several thousand vacationers. Overall BAD EXPERIENCE","March 6, 2019"
"Let's face it. Hawaii is expensive. Not uncommon to see online rates over $400. So keeping your eye peeled at the Hilton Hawaiian Village site you can scoop up a bargain. Hotel is so large - seven towers - that if they lose a big group, the traveler is rewarded. But beware - all hotels in Hawaii add on a Resort Fee to their base price. I stayed on a business trip and it was ideal. Good rooms, good food, ample dining on site and off; short walk to heart of Waikiki or taxis, Uber, Lyft abound. Nearby parks but truth is you don't have to leave if you don't want to. I recommend scouting out your spot at the pools early if you have a preference for sun or shade. The resort fee comes with discounted parking a free movie, free towels, papers, two bottles of water (they should make that daily), and generally solid customer service. This year (I was also there in 2018) the check-in process was much easier. They now have online check in but even not using it, I didn't have to wait at all. Their beach is pristine and there are all types of water activities. Be warned, the property is big so there is a lot of walking.","March 6, 2019"
"We came here for our baby moon and were sorely disappointed by the poorly designed layout of the resort and the freezing swimming pools.Poor design: Seems like the resort layout was designed to make you walk much farther than required. As a 7-month pregnant woman who was on my feet/walking most of the day, the last thing I wanted was todo upon returning to the resort was walk clear across the property to get to my room. Some walkways and building are placed in illogical places.Freezing swimming pools: As a pregnant traveller, I was planning to spend quite a bit of time at the pools as it helps relieve some of the pain/discomfort associated with pregnancy. I was only able to spend an hour or so in the Paradise Pool (the one with screaming children due to the water slides) because it is the ONLY HEATED POOL on property. The other, quieter pools were unbearably cold - it's no wonder there were hardly any people in them. Other than that our room was clean and a good size. We spent a lot of time on our balcony to soak in the views, good weather, and quiet. On-site restaurant food was mediocre at best, but with high prices - to be expected at a hotel resort. We likely won't return to this resort.","March 6, 2019"
Love this resort. A busy one but it’s so convenient to have everything in the resort. The view is fantastic from rainbow tower. This is my second trip and will be back in the future. Stayed in Kalia my first trip. It was quieter. Definitely think that you should stay in Rainbow Tower if your budget allows. I love that they respond quickly to needs and questions through texting on the app. It’s so easy to walk to restaurants and shops. Buses are so easily accessible. The fireworks is my favorite!!,"March 5, 2019"
We had one issue with the room but the hotel was quick to correct the error and gave us a a credit on our bill. It means a lot to see something like that. Be careful of the buffet at the rainbow lanai. Very expensive for a buffet in my opinion. Also attended the Waikiki Starlinks Luau. I recommend just the general permission for the event. We paid too high of a price for tickets that allowed us a few extra free drinks and front row seats that I’m sure you would have enjoyed for a lot less than we payed. Still a good show. ,"March 5, 2019"
"Lovely corner room in Rainbow Tower with amazing view. We are renting two rooms so paying $80 a day for the resort fee. Two beach chairs and 1 umbrella costs $70 a day extra to rent. Otherwise, you have to lie on your Hilton teeny tiny paper thin pool towel on the sand without any shade. Oh and there are no umbrellas around the pool area either so if you burn easily or don't want direct sun at all hours of the day, you are out of luck. I just spoke with the front desk about this and they got nothing. Shoulder shrug. I am currently looking for rooms at other hotels in Waikiki.","March 5, 2019"
"It’s a sprawling complex with walkways lined with colorful foliage and koi ponds that make getting around pleasant. Our 17th floor corner room had an oceanfront balconyas well as one that overlooked the lagoon and yacht basin, perfect for relaxing with a cold drink and a book. Our mornings started off with a wonderful buffet breakfast in the lanai. Great food and very friendly service. The pricey luau is another story. Somehow, the roof of a parking garage doesn’t say aloha. The food was mediocre, but the excellent entertainment saved the night. Loved the hotel’s photo history wall. And, the Friday fireworks were also a plus.","March 5, 2019"
"We stayed at HHW recently. I am a Hilton gold member. We stayed at Ali'li tower.Overall experience was good. Pros: 1. Beautiful property. Stayed in better Hilton properties though.2. Good View. Nice pools. very good beach.3. Comfy hotel rooms4. Awesome artificial Lagoon with water sports.Cons: 1. Unreasonably high parking fees. I found a thread on tripadvisor about a public parking, which is very close to the hotel, which worked out very cheap for us. around $16-$20 per day. $1 per hour and the parking time can be increased via app. Very Convenient.2. Overcrowded. 3. No complimentary breakfast but they offer $20 dining credit for gold members.4. I dint like the dining options within the resort. Cocktails were okay.I would highly recommend trying out Blue water shrimp (restaurant/cafe), awesome seafood!!!","March 5, 2019"
"This is my second stay in the Ali'i Tower. Positives: Location-easy access to everything you could possibly want and a beautiful beach and oceanscape; Beauty-lush foliage and landscaping with plenty of room for a calming walk; Housekeeping-WAY improved from last stay. Room always cleaned in the a.m. rather than 3pm or later. Negatives: The schlep w/ luggage from the depot seems endless. It's on uneven stone causing the spinner luggage to stop suddenly. TAKE A CAB, NOT ROBERTS...then you come right up to the main check-in; the rooms are looking tired and could use a facelift since they are in their ""luxury"" tower; I reserved a corner oceanfront room, which I got. However, on the 4th floor. The view was fine, but it was LOUD due to delivery trucks and tour busses backing up and parking under 1 balcony, and the Ali'i pool under the other balcony. I expected better for a return guest AND a Hilton Honors member. The shopping is fabulous, as before. The food in Tropics is ample and really good. Stay away from the breakfast buffet.....$40 for lukewarm fare. Next trip I will probably stay elsewhere.","March 5, 2019"
"I don’t k know if we came at the wrong time but it was too crowded, I felt like I was in a mall. The entertainment and fire works they have here was great. Would probably not stay here again. Toiletries not the best in hotel room.","March 5, 2019"
"The Hilton Rainbow Village was one of the first Luxury Highrise Planned Resorts in Waikiki.I first visited this property in 1982 with my parents and had the honor of meeting Don Ho who became a long time friend (he performed at the Hilton for 10 years).I read all the Hilton reviews on Tripadvisor, and am truly sorry some of you did not have a 5 star experience. I had a great experience this trip as I did in 1982. Now for my 27 year updated review (there was no TripAdvisor 27 years ago).We arrived and were warmly greeted at the front desk by Howel. He was very gracious and provided us early check in as well as a wonderful view in the diamond head tower. Thank you Howel. You made our arrival fantastic.Great room, great view. The room was well furnished with all the Hilton Amenities. Carpet was clean, walls nicely painted with tasteful crown molding, coach was comfortable, bed very very comfortable (always feel at home when I travel and sleep on a Hilton bed). Ac very quiet, room very quiet, hot water comes on reasonably fast (was on the 14th floor). I also really liked the anuenue coconut papaya products.  Internet was fast (was able to hook up my Roku). Great selection of channels on cable tv. I really liked the countertops and flooring in this room as well as the tiling and height adjustable removable shower head in combo tub.The Hilton service team has the Aloha spirit. Jeaney in housekeeping kept our room spotless and well stocked with everything. As I have mentioned in many previous reviews, housekeeping can make or break a visit. It is one of the most difficult jobs in the industry. Thank you Jeaney. I also had an issue with my on line check in and Hilton Corporate Supervisor Santella fixed it fast and was very gracious. The in room hair dryer did not function properly and a new one was delivered almost immediately. I have already mentioned that Howel at the front desk went above and beyond and even offered to help us with our luggage. Please keep in mind that the Hilton Bellman will not impose upon you when you arrive (a lot of folks like to carry their own bags), so when you are greeted at the curb (which we were), ask for a Bellman. Sorry Bellmen, I should have asked.Hilton has some great restaurants and stores on site, but if you are on a budget there is an iHop across the street from the Hilton Property as well as a McDonalds. There is a bus stop also outside the property that will take you anywhere you want to go on the Island for 25 cents up to $2.50 (if you want to go all the way to the North Shore). Lyft and Uber are available for pick ups behind the Diamond Head Tower. If you do not have Lyft or Uber you can use Charley’s Taxi for flat rate service at the main lobby.During our stay, we did not find it necessary to rent a car, we were able to get everywhere via tour pick up, bus or Lyft (including ride from airport). I estimate I saved almost $600 in car rental and parking fees during my stay. You can also! Feel free to email me and I will tell you how and why.The Hilton has all sorts of things to see and do within the property, and if you like to walk, everything is within about a 1.5 mile radius (including the Ala Moana Shopping Center). This shopping center has everything for everyone including the well known high end stores. It also has a very nice Macy’s whose prices are very competitive with internet prices including Amazon. They also have a great food court, and daily entertainment. If you want to go snorkeling, you might think about Kaimana Tours, they will pick you up at an arranged location, provide you snorkel gear, and return you for a very reasonable price. They take you to Hanauma Bay, which is one of the nicer and safer snorkel spots on the Island. I am sure there are also boat tours that can take you to other nice spots. Makani Catamaran (which is within walking distance - about a mile) has some very good sailing and snorkeling deals. Compare their prices to the Hilton and see which one meets your needs.The Hilton Rainbow Village continues to evolve as do their guests, and staff. Please keep in mind that this is a very large complex, maintenance is constantly ongoing and the furniture in your room that may look a bit worn is expensive teak or other woods that can never be replaced and are very expensive to refurbish. Old is not necessarily bad, and sometimes new never has a unique story or history behind it. It is just new.Thank you Hilton Family- Howel, Jeaney, Santella, Dean and all the Hilton staff - Mahalo for making me feel at home.","March 4, 2019"
"Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Very clean environment. Each room has a balcony with a spectacular view. There is so much to do on the property. Dining, shopping, activities, entertainment, even a post office. The staff is very attentive, informative, and hospitable. They remember the names of guests! Security is discreet, visible and present. So close to historical sites and shopping. ","March 4, 2019"
"Could be sensory overload for some, with the amount of people on this property, but you can find just about any activity or relaxation within walking distance. Incredibly friendly and helpful staff from checkin to waiter to towel guy. You wouldn’t have to leave the property to find anything you may want or need to purchase. Stayed in the Rainbow Tower which has incredible views of the ocean and property. Beds and pillows great! Nice to have a small refrigerator and coffee maker in the room.","March 4, 2019"
"Our family traveled recently and stayed for 8 days at the HHVWBR. The property is only a few miles from the airport , but with traffic took us 45 minutes to get there and 30 to return. The Honolulu area is VERY busy and with the commuters and visitors makes for slow traffic. We had a rental car. Valeted the first day and then self parked the rest of the week - not cheap at $45-$50 a day. The property is huge and very busy even in the off Winter season. Be prepared. There are some restaurants on site and very costly. A few other options available too, but still will cost a family of 4, not drinking, $75-100. A few non-hotel restaurants across the street and still in the $$-$$$ range. Typical for HI though, food is costly. The grounds were impeccable, well maintained, and easy to move through. Friday nights are fireworks on the beach and it gets VERY busy with lots and lots of visitiors. Be prepared. We were upgraded to a family suite (I'm a diamond member), but I heard many families getting complimentary upgrades. You should request one. Our daily services were well before 10am and were done very well. Our biggest dissapointed was the age and outdated feel of the rooms. we had stained coaches, rusted sink drains and peeling wallpaper. I do typically expect more from Hilton but with as large as the resort is, it can be possible for not every rm to be perfect. I did report to the front so they can address, if they choose to. Overall, gets a 4 out of 5 on this scale, but probably more like a 3.75.","March 3, 2019"
"The Ali'i Tower is always a terrific choice. The tower has it's own check-in desk so you can avoid the long lines at general check-in, it has it's own pool and gym area so it's not as crowded and the rooms are great. When we first checked in, they gave us a room overlooking the park (Diamond Head side of building). We didn't like it as it was on a low floor and you could hear the delivery vehicles, especially very early in the morning. The staff were very accommodating in changing our room the next day and we ended up on the 15th floor overlooking the resort and with a great water view. We saw the Friday night fireworks from the lanai and got to watch a luau at a private function on the great lawn area. This was our 3rd or 4th time at HHV and we keep coming back because the resort is really well maintained and the staff are extremely helpful, happy and friendly. Whatever you ask for, they can generally accommodate. The Ali'i Tower also has it's own concierge service so you can book restaurants, cars, or activities right there. Proximity to its own beach is a bonus and it's much less crowded than Waikiki Beach. The walk into the heart of Waikiki only takes 10 or 15 minutes, so you're still close enough to all the restaurants and shops. We'll be back!","March 3, 2019"
"We enjoyed our stay here several years ago on a family vacation to Waikiki and thought we would stay again. This time it seemed much different. The hotel didn't seem to offer that higher level of service that I expected at the price we were paying. From waking up to the plumbing of the room next door, to the cheap hotel towels, to cheap beach towels (and a threat of paying $20 if the beach towel wasn't returned), we were disappointed many times along the way. We found customer service to be lacking, and numerous times had to move at the beach of the pool when fellow guests couldn't refrain from using profanity in every sentence. The quality just wasn't what I remembered.","March 3, 2019"
"I took my Grandkids to Waikiki for summer vacation, I wanted to be right on the beach and kid friendly. They have 5 pools and this really cool lagoon. We stayed in the condo side of the resort. Rooms were spacious and the grounds are beautiful.4 star resort not for your budget trip. But well worth it.","March 3, 2019"
"Overpriced outdated accommodation in a huge village surrounded by overpriced restaurants, boutiques and other shoppping facilities too far from the centre of town. Ridiculous deposit required on check-in. Additional facility charge. I’ll never stay here again and don’t recommend it to anyone. Thee are far better places at better prices in better locations to stay at in Waikiki.","March 2, 2019"
"Love the grounds of this hotel. Worth the experience, I'll be back. Stay before Ship cruise and after, Diamond tower Room 1003 gave a awesome ocean view. Then Diamond head tower gave us a full 2 room suite. ","March 2, 2019"
-Tropics table wait time was 20min or more even when half the restaurant was empty. -tropics wait time for any food was well over 45 minutes. -hotel room was poorly cleaned when we first arrived. - the pull out bed had a horrible mattress and creaked whenever I moved-WiFi worked 10% of the time. - TV remote did not work. -construction noise was started at 9am sharp every day - All Hilton staff treated us like a number rather then a paying guest. - 2 out of 4 water slides worked. Which made for conjestion in the pools and lineups for the working slides. - Swimming pools were poorly maintained and were dirty all the time. - Charging for umbrellas and beach chairs is an insane concept for paying guest at any hotel. -The lagoon was dirty and the beach was as hard as concrete or pull out bed. - We watched a 5 year old boy have his lifeless body pulled out of the pool by a Hilton guest. He had drowned in the pool and was resuscitated Tate it by another guest who was a nurse. This all happed while all Hilton staff watched helplessly for some reason. One Hilton staff memeber told us that kids drown at this pool pretty frequently. Which tells me that a certified life guard Should be at all the pools during pools hours especially given the price that we paid to be there and the number of people in and out of the facilitiesThe best part of our stay was leaving.,"March 1, 2019"
"We stayed at the HHV for a conference. We have stayed here many times in the past for conferences but actually had more time to enjoy the grounds. We had a great stay. There’s obviously a ton to do and close to great restaurants and activities. Of course the beach was great and the conference facilities were great (nice not having to shuttle to the convention center.) we usually stay in the rainbow tower but this time went for an ocean front alii tower room. The private pool was very excellent and easy and the staff/ concierge were very helpful. We had a fabulous room with a great view. It was clean and modern. We didn’t eat at any of the restaurants in the “village” (other than lapperts) but made great use of the Honolulu cookies, ABC stores, etc. easy walk to great restaurants all over Waikiki.

"On our recent vacation to Hawaii, our first stop was to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Let me first say, get a map first thing. The place is huge with many, many places to stay. Once you have checked in at the out door desk (steps from Waikiki Beach) get the map. For its size it was very, very clean. The rooms are quite nice but truly you won’t spend much time there. There are places to eat, places to snack, places for adult beverages, places to see live entertainment, did I mention there is a BEACH! And the fireworks on Friday night were very cool. Recover from your travel here. You won’t be sorry.","March 1, 2019"

"After island hopping from Kauai -- we amped the trip up with a more touristy hotspot. We decided on the Hilton and upgraded to the Rainbow tower -- offering wicked beachfront views. The surrounding grounds are occupied by resident Parrots and other tropical birds, which is a unique experience. There are plenty of surrounding shops and places to grab coffee within walking distance of the hotel. The room itself was quite comfortable - the property is somewhat dated, but we didnt' spend much time there anyhow. The location is great, so we hopped on the beachfront path all the way down the Waikiki beach walk. On the lagoon side, we entered a live filming scene for an episode of Hawaii Five-O! My friend unknowingly entered the scene with extras and is probably in the background of an episode, lols.I'd stay at this property again. Great location, amenities -- lagoon and pool. What more can you want?","February 28, 2019"
"I have no idea why the staff, especially around the pool areas, doesn't try to discourage the screeching, screaming kids, but it's miserable. You can hear them in the room bathroom with the doors all shut.","February 28, 2019"
"Highs: (1) Camp Penguin. Our 6-y-o boy absolutely loved Camp Penguin. There were four different ladies who staffed the camp during the four days he attended (2/22 - 2/25), and he adored them. He wants to know why he can't quit sports at home and return to Camp Penguin each day, and he cried off and on for the next three days after we left. Thank you so much for showing him such a good time. (2) Food and beverage was good. Bali dinner and the Rainbow Lanai breakfast were over-priced even for a resort, but food was good. Round Table Pizza and Rocky Japanese were priced better and both were very good. Fish sandwich at Paradise was great. The Cadillac margarita and Category 5 Hurricane at the Taco place beside the pool were also very good. Service was very good at each restaurant. Breakfast service was a little patchier, but it's a buffet mainly, so no biggie. The onsite acai berry juice store (begins with an L) was very good, the power bowl (quinoa puffs, chia seeds, bananas, etc.) was really good. Even Starbucks service was pretty good and quick in spite of the long lines each morning. (4) Staff was friendly and hard-working. Kristin at front office, and the kind lady who checked me into the hotel when I was a disoriented mess, were both fantastic! (3) Views from the ocean-view rooms were wonderful. On the west-facing side of the Rainbow Tower, we were able to watch a fireworks show from our balcony, and were treated to a double-rainbow after a rain shower. (4) The beach is beautiful, and right beside the hotel. (5) Room was sufficiently spacious for the three of us to share for four days. We were comfy.Lows. (1) There is a restaurant beneath our room on the 4th floor in the Rainbow Tower, and the cooking odors from the vent fan (oil/frying smells) linger on the balcony and fill your room if you leave the balcony door open. A higher floor is probably better. (2) There are a lot of rocks in the beach, once you step into the water. If you have swim/water shoes, bring them! Don't try heavy Keen sandals or something - you'd drown! (3) The property is very busy. Be prepared to wait at the front desk any time of day. For checkout, we called bell service 30 minutes before we needed to leave, and they never made it to our room. Instead, my wife and I lugged the bags ourselves. (4) The ""free"" water is not a resort benefit. It is bait to get you to listen to a sales pitch for the time share. (5) Pool was not heated. My son didn't care, but a bit to chilly for wimpy old mom and dad. (6) Mattress was a bit worn, I had to sleep in the ""trough"". Comforter and sheet are sewn together, so you can't kick-off just the comforter if you get hot. (7) No children's allergy medicine at the onsite ABC store. You gotta go to CVS/Long's Drugs or Walmart (if it's after 6pm) off property - $8 Uber each way. (8) Do not watch the herons hunt when there are ducklings nearby. The herons aren't hunting the fish...it's heartbreaking!!! Other notes: (1) Keep you ID with you. Some of the restaurants and stores require it, in order to let you charge to your room. (2) No pool toys allowed. Overall good. I would happily stay here again. I might try for a high floor with ocean view in the Tapa Tower next time. The gym is in the Tapa Tower.","February 28, 2019"
"We stayed here the night before our cruise. The property is very beautiful, clean and convenient to dining and shopping. Staff was pleasant and helpful. The rooms were large and clean. Check-in was a bit of a wait but other than that I have no complaints.","February 28, 2019"
"I’d like to start off by recognizing the outstanding employees that made my stay 100% more memorable. Will the doorman has an amazing attitude and a very happy energy that can set the tone for anyone staying at a hotel in Hawaii! Will and Austin both have a sincere attitude, they’re both willing to genuinely help you with practically anything you need help with.Ward plays a big part in our stay with Hilton Hawaiian Village. Ward made sure we had the best room for the category that we booked and he made sure we had a smooth check in process. Amber and Kelly from front desk didn’t just helped us with directions, they made sure my girlfriend and I were both enjoying our stay and were willing to go the extra step to ensure that we were having a good time at this amazing resort. Chad from valet was quick to get our car from the lot and he was extremely friendly. The resort has a lot of amenities for a $45 amenity fee. The pool(s) are pretty big and some of the pools have water slides. The fitness center is pretty big for a hotel fitness center. I usually always judge hotels by their negative reviews but I honestly have nothing negative to say about this hotel.","February 28, 2019"
"The grounds and property are absolutely beautiful with plenty of interesting restaurants, stores and koi ponds to look at. The 1 bedroom in the Lagoon Tower was perfect for a family of two children and two adults. The kitchen provides everything needed to cook any type of meal and the bed was extremely comfortable as was the pull out sofa. It seems there are good views from any of the rooms. Lagoon Tower is easy walking distance to the beach, lagoon and the kids slide pool. We really loved staying in this tower. There were three swimming pools that we could use: kids slide pool, pool outside of Rainbow Tower and the Tapa Pool. By 10:00am there were never any chairs available as there were so MANY people wanting to sit by the pool. The water was freezing cold and no-one was swimming in the pool but hanging at the edge of the pool simply getting their feet wet because it was too cold to get in. (despite the hot temperatures outside) There was not one umbrella by any of the pools. So no umbrella's, water too cold to swim in and being 85 degree's outside - well makes for a short stay at the pool. Even the Rainbow Tower pool had no-one swimming due to the cold water. An adult cannot properly visit and stay at the slide pool due to the hundreds of children. Poolside XS size drinks are $12 - $15. If your interested to stay at the ocean then you must rent a chair for $18 and an umbrella for $35. For a family of four a few hours on the beach adds up to $107. I should remind that this is over and above the $40 you pay for resort fee's everyday. I'm wondering just what those resort fee's cover since there is NO place to sit at the pools, NO umbrella's, COLD non-swimable water. I expected to spend my days at the pool or ocean and it wasn't possible for us and this was my disappointment with the hotel. The restaurants on-site were extremely expensive and overpriced for the quality of food. But then all of the restaurants in Waikiki are extremely overpriced. ($22 for a burger and fries) is standard pricing. Weather and scenery are beautiful as always and Waikiki always brings good family fun.","February 28, 2019"
"The Kalia Tower was a nice find. Having stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village several times, I was at first disappointed to be in the Kalia Tower. It is older and a bit shabby. However, I did have an ocean view (sort of) and the room was clean. This tower has an upscale spa, a pool, easy access to shopping and restaurants and its own front desk and streetside entrance. Rather than crowded main desk, Kalia has its own for check-in and check-out, passenger drop-off and pick-up and easy walk to public transportation. The convenience of this tower, lower prices and the spa makes Kalia Tower preferable no one goes to Hawaii to sit in a hotel room.","February 28, 2019"
"This is a huge resort, capacity-wise (not necessarily in terms of the territory. It sits next to a commercial ""village"" of sorts (the usual array of overpriced restaurants and various shops catering to tourist clientele).There's nothing special to it, I'd even call it ""faceless"" despite a stream of celebrities and dignitaries of all kinds that graced the hotel with their presence and even movies exposure - but, at the same time, there's nothing to complain about. The hotel is being well-run and well-maintained. The rooms are rather standard for resorts of this kind. The beach is right there (not the best, though - large-grain sand and quite a bit of crushed shells). In the room, we were pleasantly surprised to find a PS-3 gaming console that can run both games and DVDs you may rent from automated kiosks (free if you have a status of certain level with Hilton).The hotel has a large, well-equipped gym (I counted 33 cardio machines plus HIIT/pulley rack, all typical main-muscle groups strength machines, a full rack of dumbbells running through 100 lbs, balls, batons, etc. There's a nice spa, too. They also offer group classes in various sports.Breakfasts were ok, although I'd expect a bit higher variety of morning foods. In any case, there are options for dining within a walking distance from the hotel.All in all, a positive experience. By Hawaii standards, an excellent hotel.","February 27, 2019"
"First off, kudos to all the staff here at HHV - they are doing an amazing job and deserve the world for what they do every day for their guests. I have read a few reviews about people complaining about service - I didn't experience any of that. I am a HH Diamond - sometimes I don't get any recognition for my status at all (i cannot care less as my work pays for most of my stays - and I get to hang on to my points) but this HHV blew me away with their hospitality. We were here to celebrate our anniversary and met this beautiful lady, Donna P. We chatted a bit, and then she surprised us with a ocean view room upgrade to Rainbow tower. Oh, and I booked my entire stay using points I had accumulated over the past year - so it was a free stay for me. My original booking promised a mere resort view room. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Donna's hospitality. She also went above and beyond to surprise us with some celebration gift from wiki wiki. We came across few other staff during our stay and each of them were pleasant. If you care about these genuinely hard working people, please support their movement so resorts pay them a living wage and no one has to work multiple jobs. Our room was spacious - with a gorgeous view. However, the sign of aging was evident. These rooms can use some spruce up. We found some insects on and around the coffee machine. I am not sure what kind of insects are these but attaching a photo in case you can identify and decide for yourselves. They have 55-inch tv and a PS3 in room. You can also enjoy DVD rental with your DVD now card (you'll receive it when you check in). Our PS3 didn't initially work - we had to call maintenance and they figured last guest decided to take the HDMI cord home with them (another reminder what hospitality industry workers have to deal with everyday).You can find colorful fish, parrots, macaws, doves, pigeons, turtles and all sort of things scattered throughout the property. The hidden gem is the 4th floor pool across from the gym (no splashing kids around). If you're Gold or Diamond - you'll also receive $10 per day per person food credit. For our 5 day stay between two of us, it was a neat $100 to spent. You can use that credit all at once or in increments (don't have to use everyday) - which was great. The weekly fireworks are amazing too. Beach equipment rental are a bit pricey, food quality varies so much among restaurants - it's hard to believe they are run by the same management. Rainbow tower elevator had all their switches outside - remember to press your floor first before entering. All in all, this was a great stay and we are very grateful for the hospitality extended to us. We will be back, hopefully in the next couple of years. Tip: Ask for ocean view room. This property is huge (3390 rooms) with multiple ~30 story towers. If you're stuck in a terrace view - you'll be missing out on the breath-taking ocean view.","February 27, 2019"
"I love hilton, but for this hotel, I really cannot recommend for anyone. We booked the most expansive room of the hotel, but except bigger room, the whole room was old and feel like in a 3 stars hotel room. Not worthy for the price at all. Won't recommend for this hotel.","February 26, 2019"
"Me and my father really enjoyed everything about this hotel. Would recommend it to anyone and hopefully we can soon return for another vacation.Beds were big and really comfy, also nice and big rooms.","February 26, 2019"
"Room accommodations were top notch. Price was high. Check-in was very slow - seemed to be a slow computer issue - we stood in line for 15 minutes before being waited on (and that was the Hilton Honors line - the ""regular guest"" line was much worse), and then it took anther 15 minutes to complete the check-in process. Breakfast buffet price was very high ($40), so we ate elsewhere. Admittedly, everything is expensive in the Waikiki Beach area. Parking garage was convenient with plenty of space, but expensive at $45/night. If you are willing to pay up for a nice room in a premium location, this is a good choice. ","February 26, 2019"
"Horrible 13 days spent here. Running toilet waking you up in the middle of the night, air conditioning not getting room cool, but worst was the pool deck with infants utilizing the pool and hot tub in diapers (not swimmers diapers). Completely unsanitary and unnecessary w/3 pools better designed for children (keikei with slide, superpool and Tapa pool with bubblers). This was not the relaxing Hawaiian Vacation I envisioned when I planned this trip. in March of 2018.Do not eat at Bali Steak and Seafood unless you like to pay triple what it's worth and the food and presentation is severely lacking. Do yourself a favor and go to Top of Waikiki and get a great meal for 50% less with an amazing view of downtown Waikiki Beach, the mountains and Diamond Head. Also, don't miss out on a great meal at Mortons located in the Ala Moana Shopping Center, also 50% less than Bali and the food and service was excellent.","February 26, 2019"
"Attended a meeting here. Room upgraded as I’m a Diamond member. Had a large balcony almost the size of the room. The room was small. No full length mirror. Daughter had a room that faced the pool but also had an ocean view. She had a smaller, but adequate, balcony. However, music from nearby bar was loud. Restaurants on property on very expensive side. Nice place bu too many people to be romantic ","February 24, 2019"
"This resort has so many amenities that one does not need to leave during a stay. Beautiful private beach, many places to eat, great shops, water sports and pools. All is priced at a premium for your convenience. Only in the abc store will you find reasonable costs. They do tend to nickel and dime you, with a $40 daily resort fee and $50 daily parking fee. Also they wanted to charge us$150 for late check out.","February 24, 2019"
"Being here in Dec 2016 to celebrate our anniversary, my fiancé and I thought the rooms were somewhat rundown but it did not bother us that much. We booked a partial ocean view room. Internet was choppy and hard to connect to but we were out most of the time so it didn’t bother us either. We had such a great time we decided we would have to come back someday, we just didn’t expect to come back again in Dec 2018. Back for the second time, we booked an ocean view room this time in the rainbow tower. At check in we got upgraded to the rainbow tower room with the double balconies. I’ve never seen a more beautiful view! We pretty much spent our week inside the hotel enjoying the view. Internet was definitely better this time around. The rooms are still old but it’s understandable. The elevators can get busy at times and you’d have to wait because they would be so packed. We were able to view the fireworks from our balcony. My fiancé got sick from eating somewhere on the hotel grounds, couldn’t pinpoint what it was but we still enjoyed ourselves, at least we had the gorgeous view. I have to give praise to our housekeeper who made an effort every morning to say good morning to us and asked us everyday how her service was and if there was anything we needed. That was nice of her as I felt like she was paying attention to us. The day we checked out, she said she hopes we will be back, and I certainly do hope I can come back for a third time!

"We were so excited to check off a bucket list vacation for my husband's 50th birthday. SO DISAPPOINTED!!! by looking at many other reviews we are not alone. This property is in major need of an update, but all they want yo do is try to sell you one of their new suites in the new timeshare tower. Stayed in the Ali'i tower which h us the most expensive and boasts many benefits. Our refrigerator froze all if our good and beverages....we had a soda explode all over the room when we opened it. All they did for ys was defrost the fridge. Our bathtub clogged up twice, disgusting. We only had a down comforter with a duvet cover. No top sheet or blanket??? Our carpet was FILTHY, our dresser was literally falling apart and was nearly unusable as it didn't stay in the tracks. Our ""private"" pool used to have a large hot tub that is now filled with potted plants, there is a residential hot tub to compensate, really???? Invest in your current property before building new towers. This resort caters heavily to the Japanese visitors. I would guess they were 80% of the guests. Our staff at our check-in lobby never acknowledged us after we cheiin, we were there for 10 days. The pools in the ""village"" incredible insufficient for the amount of guests staying there....and they've built a new tower??? The hotel us dirty and not taken care of. The restaurants are average with staggering prices. Steak dinner at Bali cost us $285. The weather was awful during our trip and there's no quiet places to just have a drink or hang out. Really disappointed overall, we'll never be back.","February 23, 2019"
"This was our first time in Hawaii and I couldn’t be more pleased with Hilton! The room was great, the beach was beautiful, the Friday night fireworks were spectacular, and the staff was a blessing! I would encourage anyone looking at trip to Waikiki to stay at the Rainbow Tower. The whole complex was phenomenal though. ","February 23, 2019"
"Lovely hotel and views. Staff at checkin were snippy and not overly helpful. Other staff like concierge, bellman very helpful. Our major issue was with ADA accessibility. The rooms had no roll-in and no transfer bench. No lamp, no chair except a rolling one that I couldn’t transfer into safely. And located far from the elevator.","February 23, 2019"
"Absolutely the best place to stay in Hawaii! Everything is right there for you, shops, restaurants, pools & the beach!!! Close to Ala Moana & the main strip of Waikiki. Bonus is the Friday night fireworks, a must for everyone to see!","February 23, 2019"
"The ‘superpool’ was closed for several consecutive days and nothing was communicated to guests. Television service was interrupted periodically. Premium TV was a nightmare to figure out. Almost like they didn’t want you to stay in your room, but get out and use restaurants and shops.","February 22, 2019"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach is a HUGE resort with multiple pools, restaurants, spa options, shops, etc. it is located on the beach and I had a great view of the ocean from my room. The room was large and clean with comfortable bedding. However, the couch and chair were a bit tired and the carpet was worn.The conference facilities were good.If I travel to Hawaii with my husband, I would much prefer a smaller hotel with more a personal feel. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is actually a village and might be exactly what a family would prefer - many choices of activities and a lot of ""energy"".","February 22, 2019"
This was our overnight stop before boarding the pride of American for a week long cruise to th Hawaiian islandsRooms were nice and the resorts looked great but we really didn't have much time to enjoy.,"February 22, 2019"
"We have stayed at this resort twice in the last 3 years and coming back this summer. We love the location, the amenities, the shoppes and it’s close proximity to great shopping and restaurants. My husband has tried to convince my daughter and I to fly to Maui or try another hotel and our daughter wants nothing to do with that idea, she has such a great time at the Hawaiian Village. Rooms in Alii tower (where we usually stay) are clean, service is excellent and the ocean views are unbelievable. We love this hotel so much that we have convinced our relatives in VA to join us this summer. Can’t wait to be back and enjoy some delicious Mai Tais on the beach. ","February 22, 2019"
"I want to be fair by starting with the positives. This is a beautiful property with everything you will need at your fingertips. The kids loved the beach, pools, and the food. The rooms were clean and the staff was generally nice. That said our stay was not what we expected as Hilton Diamond Members. There is no exec. lounge, no free breakfast (there is a $10 credit instead that barely covers a breakfast biscuit), no room upgrades, and even a slightly late check out was like pulling teeth. We have lower status with IHG and Marriott but would would have been better off with the those chains in this case. I understand this is a very popular resort but they need to have some way of offering differientiated experiences to elite members.","February 21, 2019"
"Had a wonderful experience — quick checkin, great views. Plenty of activities on site to enjoy the beach, pool, local restaurants and shops. We stayed in the Rainbow tower and had beautiful views the coastline. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again","February 21, 2019"
This was our second stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and I couldn't believe we got an even better room than last time. I bought the package again through Costco and bought an upgrade to Rainbow Tower Ocean front room. We were again assigned a corner room and it was spectacular!Even though I was very sick with a terrible cold while I was there we had a fantastic time. All of the staff were very helpful and the room was very clean and spacious.,"February 20, 2019"
This is a fantastic resort. Several water attractions. We spent every morning on the walk out Beach and after lunch move over to the Pool with the slides. There is an IHOP across the street from resort and a fabulous food truck that parks just on the other side of the lagoon. Also a McDonald’s within walking distance. Shops galore. The interior is not new or updated but was clean and abundance of room.We had requested numerous times to have adjoining king rooms but only after arriving and asking again did they finally let us know they didn’t have any adjoining king rooms! I don’t know why we weren’t told from the beginning. Parking is expensive @ the parking garage if you have a rental car there at the resort. ,"February 20, 2019"
"This was our 5th time staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We love the proximity and the beaches. We stayed in the Ali’i tower. The rooms were nice. There are opportunities for improvement with customer service. Overall a great trip, but they do not go above and beyond like other resorts we have stayed. The folks in the business center and post office onsite are rude. ","February 19, 2019"
"Price is moderate to high but best location on Waikiki. Beach front resort with great shops, Friday night fireworks/show, free appetizers on fridays and saturdays, and walking distance to many great spots like ala Moana mall, don quijote, foodland, Marukame udon shop, sky waikiki (rooftop bar), etc. best bang for your buck unless you are gunna do air bnb. Multiple gyms as well.","February 19, 2019"
"Let’s just get the good part out of the way. The valet crew was nice. Downhill from there. Our room was filthy. Paint was chipped. Air filter was disgusting, full of dust. Pools were weak. Only one hot tub open the whole week. Sign said 9 people max capacity with no children under 5. At one point I counted 35 people in the hot tub. 10 were infants. I’ve never seen anything quite like it. It was like this every day. Time for a remodel. ","February 19, 2019"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village is a Category 7 Hilton property located right on Waikiki beach. The hotel is located about 8 miles from Honolulu International Airport. One night stay at this resort costs about 60,000 HHonors points (points price fluctuate with actual price now instead of fixed price).We arrived at the hotel on a Saturday (Memorial Day Weekend) and it was crazy busy. Check-in took about 30 minutes and we were upgraded to Rainbow Tower, corner room. There was no complimentary breakfast for Gold status members although we did get a dining credit of $10 USD per person (for double occupancy).We had a great view of the lagoon by the hotel. For our first day dinner at the hotel, we tried some Nachos and hot-dogs paid for partially by our daily dining credit. For our dinner on second night we ate at the property and ordered some buffalo wings and pizza. Both were quite delicious.We spent quite a bit of time by the pools on property as well as the beach.Thumbs up:Location !! Right on Waikiki BeachVery responsive front desk who upgraded us to a fantastic room with great viewsThumbs down:Resort located over vast area and everything seems too long to walk to.Everything felt overpriced on the property (sure its Hawaii but still)$10 USD dining credit per person per day does not cover much at the propertymilespointstravel.com","February 18, 2019"
"We had an opportunity to stay here for a quick winter getaway from the cold winter~ resort is situated in a great spot on waikiki. Room has a small fridge which is great for simple drinks, or yogurts for breakfast. Restuarants are pricy on the resort but thats the area. Ala moana a short walk away as are lots of other food choices. Pools could be warmer/heated considering it is winter in Hawaii, What really shone was the staff. We had a fabulous housekeeper and the guest services on the app (which made asking questions a breeze). They were great and helped make out trip easier! We do hope to be back soon!","February 18, 2019"
"I loved the location and stays in the past were great but it was a bygone era. Now towers are in dire need up paint, carpet cleaning and new furniture. Very disappointing for an International Conference","February 17, 2019"
"We visited Hilton Hawaiian Village in August 2018. We paid extra to stay in the Rainbow Tower with the Lagoon view. I would have preferred an Ocean view room, but we had already paid enough for that upgrade. The room was very clean and spacious and the staff were friendly and attentive. Be prepared to wait in line at check in. If you decide to get a rental car, be prepared to pay a parking fee of around $40.00 per day, and depending on when you visit, also be prepared to pay a $40.00 per night Resort fee. Once you are there there are a plenty of dining options on property, as well as plenty of activities. Settle in and enjoy, you will love this property.","February 17, 2019"
"Our stay was in the Ali’i Tower. We had an fantastic ocean view room & each evening was closed out enjoying the live music down below. A beautiful view of the ocean to wake up to & fabulous beeeW and music to end each day! The little extra perks of staying in the Ali’i tower, were actually a big deal. We enjoyed a quick check-in with the towers own check in desk, the private pool with a much lesser crowd & the advanced seating at Tropics cut down on our wait time to be seated greatly. With an oversized room & luxurious bathroom, which offers the absolute best toiletry amenities of all my travels. The Rainbow Avenue line is a little taste of spa treatment!The only negative I could find with the resort was in the business hours of restaurants and gift shop. I was amazed at how early the gift shop closed, which resulted in us making purchases away from the resort. The days of operation of several of the restaurants was another surprising factor, being closed on Sundays & Monday’s. Again, promoting us to leave the resort area for a variety of dining experiences. We tried to eat at a few of the on-site options, but could not find gluten free foods available. This is something I am accustomed to, so not an issue that would cause me to give anything anything less than a 5 star rating!! Thank you for a beautiful stay during our vacation!! This will always be our choice of accommodations when we return!!","February 16, 2019"
"There's a check-in line for ""everyone"" which can be long especially with a convention in town, but opt for the All'i Tower which has its own check-in, pool, concierge. If you have the ocean-view, you probably have a balcony where you can watch the Friday night fireworks. Ocean was very calm when we were there. We found the Bali Restaurant to be excellent. Service there is great. If you're ""avoiding"" restaurants, try the ""ABC store"" for groceries and souvenirs. It's off- property but lots of people are walking around. Don't miss the wall of history which includes Elvis staying there and performing. You should consider wearing a hat while out walking. ","February 16, 2019"
"We paid a $20 upgrade to have a Partial Ocean View room. We stayed on a Friday night which meant that we could watch the fireworks from our balcony. The Ali'i Tower has it's own check-in desk which is also convenient. This tower also has a private pool overlooking the ocean (and fireworks). I was worried that this tower might not be family friendly, but this was not an issue. The room was clean, modern, and provided complimentary bottles of water. The wifi was fast and reliable with the ability to connect a number of devices which was important for our family.","February 16, 2019"
"What a great place. I think you can make of it as you wish.The only real problem was at check in, with the high number of guests trying to check in it did take a long time, but in saying that once we got through that area all was pretty good. So close to beach, walk out front & there you are, fireworks on Friday night excellent.Only real complaint was that the food was expensive, but that was where ever you went in Honolulu.","February 15, 2019"
"We stayed in the rainbow tower which was lovely but upon arrival the King Ocean View on a higher floor was not available and we (Honors members) were given the same old spiel ""rooms are not guaranteed blah blah blah..."" and were given a lower level floor which overlooked the roof skylights but beyond that we saw ocean. The property does have a lot of amenities but you should be prepared to walk everywhere which I didn't mind it was nice, but some may be put off by that. Also, if you want to use the paddleboards etc. sign up for the daily resort fee which is $40 per day. The lagoon is nice, but not hardly the color conveyed on the website. We ordered room service one night thinking it would be wheeled in on a cart with a butler service especially since there was a $10 delivery fee tacked on; but, instead it was brought by in a to-go box like a fast food order. This is a far cry from any room service I have ever had before. We laughed about the lack of professionalism. Overall its a nice resort, but not 5 star. I would not visit again.","February 15, 2019"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village not recommended Had better services at other Hilton hotels in Honolulu, Maui, and in the states. I’m a Gold HH member but would never had known it. I’m guessing earning the points is profitable for you but when it comes to using the points for anything it feels like you tell your staff we are not important.","February 15, 2019"
"Terrific location, great service, a bit commercialized but nice beach area Gilligan's Island food truck is only steps away too ! Lots of restaurants and bars to choose from on site, while other local hang outs are just a short walk away (Harbor Pub and Arnold's)","February 15, 2019"
"The hotel is great proximity to the beach. Lots of room options. Food was tasty. Prices are high. The pool doesn't allow a lot of activities nor were there any ongoing activities in the pool. Good first Hawaiian experience, but wouldn't choose this hotel again. $40 per night resort fee. I am not sure what I was paying for! I feel like I was thoroughly gouged for every penny at this hotel. You have to rent chairs to use on the beach. Make sure you grab a map when you get there to help orient yourself as it is a big property and the staff don't like to help with services you haven't paid them for.","February 15, 2019"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village is lovely hotel, stunning views and the fireworks display is amazing. It's very big, like a city in itself! Shops, pools, restaurants. Away from the main Waikiki strip but still within walking distance. Plenty of other restaurants and shops down this end of town too and you can walk to Ala Moana Shopping Centre if you like walking.","February 14, 2019"
"We were here for a convention. We have stayed here twice before. Check in was easy and the front desk was very friendly and helpful. We loved our suite in the Tapa tower. It had a beautiful view of Rainbow tower and the beach. Our housekeeper (Maria S.) was wonderful as well. We enjoyed happy hour poolside at Tapa tower. Conveniently, there were two ABC stores and two Starbucks on site. This hotel definitely has the best stretch of Waikiki. The Friday night fireworks were magical. We didn't eat here much as it is pretty expensive. We would definitely stay here again.","February 13, 2019"
"Vehicle Accessibility to Property; getting into the hotel complex by car is VERY DIFFICULT! The traffic snarl at the registration desk was horrible!Location (safety, restaurants, convenience stores); the Hilton Hawaiian Village is really a series of hotels (separate towers). The property is HUGE, and peppered with great restaurants and shops from “ABC Stores” (sort of upscale 7-11’s) to places selling diamond jewelry. If you can’t find it on the grounds you probably don’t really need it!Parking (close availability, addl cost); self-parking was very expensive ($43/day) and available spaces are limited. Valet parking is $50/day + tip.Check-In (adequate staffing, speed/ease, friendliness/helpfulness); check-in was fast, easy and friendly… everything I expect from Hilton. During our stay the Bell Captain and the Reception Desk were very helpful and addressed all of our concerns and requests quickly with typical Hilton friendliness.Cleanliness & Maintenance (condition of property & room); the entire property was very nice, well maintained. Our room was very clean and in good repair.Amenities - Hotel (gym, pool, 'quick shop', valet and/or coin laundry, business center w/printer); there was only ONE gym for the entire sprawling Hotel complex! That one gym was well appointed however.THIS POINT ALONE MAKES ME THINK I WILL NOT BE BACK! Laundry; there is NO COIN LAUNDRY! For a place that specifically caters to families with children there is NO COIN LAUNDRY! How hard would that be to put in? Absolutely inexcusable! Give up one regular hotel room, set up four or five washers and dryers in there and call it done. How hard is that? After about 5 days we needed to do some minor laundry (4 days’ worth of underwear, socks, t-shirts and a couple of bathing suits). With no coin laundry I priced what it would cost us to have the valet laundry clean these few clothes (about a half of a normal home washer load). The total came to $102! This forced me to drive to a crappy, rundown nearby laundromat and sit for 90 minutes of my time in Hawaii to do my laundry. I was afraid that if I left for any reason my laundry would be stolen. Very, very disappointed in Hilton for this. I cannot recall EVER staying at a Hilton that had no coin laundry.Amenities - Room (coffee service, hair dryer, iron/board); coffee service, but not K-cups. In-room safe. Iron and ironing board.Room Service (variety, quality, surcharge, prices overall); no lunch room service. Dinner menu was fairly limited. Prices were about what you’d expect.Morning Breakfast Buffet (quality, price); there is no traditional morning breakfast buffet as most Hilton Honors folks have come to expect. Another BIG reason I probably won’t be back!Desk Space (desk, chair, lighting, power outlets); no office chair in my room. I requested one and it was promptly delivered. Power outlets are adequate, but there are no dedicated USB power outlets (I can live without that, and only mention it because some newer hotels do have that).Comfort (bed, other seating, bathroom layout, HVAC); the bed was comfortable, as was the rest of the furniture. Air conditioning was great – big plus for Hawaii!Noise level (other guests, city noise); our stay was very quiet, and we were not disturbed by noise from the hallway or from adjacent rooms at first. But hold on! We then got neighbors on both sides of our room that were VERY noisy! Can’t really blame the hotel for that. The noise didn’t raise to the level of needing to be reported the front desk. Still very annoying.Internet (speed, cost, reliability, 'share-ability'); supposedly we were bring provided with “premium Internet service” due to our Hilton Honors Gold status, but if that was true I’d hate to see what their “normal” internet is! Internet speed = 8 to 10 MBPS, which was NOT sufficient to stream Netflix or anything else (yeah, I measure it).Streaming to TV (able to connect Chromecast, Fire Stick, etc); with the advent of streaming media over the Internet most hotels no longer offer any movies pay-per-view. Fine by me! That old system was expensive and rarely provided anything I was interested in. I now carry a Google Chromecast device, set up a private wireless network and “cast” my media content to the TV in my hotel room. The TV in our room was well positioned away from the wall and allowed me to easily attach my Chromecast device. Also, the TV remote provided easy access to the “input menu” which allowed me to easily select my Chromecast. There was an X-Box type gaming device in the room. I don’t game so it may have been some other brand… I really don’t know for sure. Apparently, that was also the DVD player, and recent release movie DVDs were offered free of charge to guests. The cable TV channel lineup was about what you would expect, but there were no premium channels available.Housekeeping (efficiency); typical Hilton quality. Friendly and efficient. This is a big part of what keeps me coming back to Hilton hotels.Additional costs (valet only, resort fee, etc); you’re going to pay the new “Transient Accommodations Tax” (aka Resort Tax) of about 1% added to your room charge EVERY DAY. For our stay on this occasion that amounted to about $25 additional charge PER DAY. That’s no on Hilton, of course, but you need to know for planning purposes. I can't post a link to this tax here but you can easily find it online.","February 13, 2019"
"We stayed in Rainbow Tower Ocean view room, got room on 7th floor so could just see over trees to beach and ocean. Room was a good size, beds comfortable and room cleaned well each day. Decor in tower and room outdated and room was noisy in evenings from entertainments in bar below. The pool is described as large but it isn’t and it doesn’t open until 9am. Tower has good location almost on the beach. Beach towels are free but beach loungers and umbrellas aren’t.The resort is large and food and drink very expensive and average quality. The daily resort fee is high and does not include car parking, this costs an extra $45 per night at least, outrageous. There is a public car park near the Rainbow Tower $1 an hour for 24 hr parking.","February 13, 2019"
Spent four days at this location and from check in to check out it certainly wasn’t up to Hilton’s standards. Check in took over half an hour and that was in the Honors line!! Our room was in the Tapa Tower. Room was clean but long overdo for a refresh. The landscaping and pools were beautiful but service was consistently lacking. Food quality was average but the prices were off the charts in all the locations. If your going to charge top dollar you should provide outstanding service. Didn’t happen. Right to the check out the staff were by and large indifferent. In fact the man in the luggage holding room was down right rude. Not up to the Hilton name!,"February 12, 2019"
"A really nice resort. We had a great familly room (4 persons). Mountain few in the 26th floor was amazing in the morning, when the sun gets up. And Honolulu is perfect for shopping and if you go with the car 20 minutes outside the city you have the best for hikking, snorkelling and site seeing. Oahu is beautiful and full of history.","February 12, 2019"

"Stayed in Alii tower ocean view. It was clean, spacious, had comfy beds, and the ocean view a must. There are several pools across the property. My family enjoyed the pools and hot tub near the lagoon, and the surfing class for purchase.","February 12, 2019"
"We arrived late and weren’t really paying attention when they sent us to Tapa tower and not Diamond Head as was indicated in our confirmation. While the room we had was large it was clearly dated in terms of furnishings and the view left a lot to be desired. Credit to the staff for sorting that out for us the next day and getting us a room in the tower we booked with a better than average view and more contemporary ambienceProperty itself is very pleasant and well maintained with an abundance of amenities, shopping and dining to choose from in site and the heart of the shopping district a short walk away. Protected beach and lagoon are great if you are there when the water is a bit rough. If you have a snorkel head out near the rock jetties in the afternoon and see if you can spot the sea turtles I was lucky enough to swim with there on a couple afternoons. ","February 12, 2019"
Beautiful on the beach location!!! This hotel sits directly on the sand and has its own pier. You only get a beach view if you stay in the Alii tower or the rainbow tower. This place is soooo packed with people everything takes more time. You will wait in line for everything. There is even an extremely long line just to eat the breakfast buffet. If you love to people watch this is the spot for you. If you like any privacy this is not the place for you.,"February 12, 2019"
"Have been here at least 7 times! My husband loves the Lagoon Tower the best!

Close walk to the city also! ","February 12, 2019"
We stayed here for 4 nights in a partial ocean view room on the Alii tower. Some very nice restaurants on the grounds and also within walking distance.

There is a parking garage across the street for $15 for 24 hours!! ,"February 12, 2019"
we only stayed here for one night prior to departing on a cruise and were surprised by the vast amount of shopping. we had a room in the rainbow tower and it was very nice. spacious and well done as you would expect from Hilton. its a little tough to navigate into the check in area as it is a narrow driveway from the main road towards the beach. lots going on around. Friday night fireworks were cool. lots of dining options. LOTS of people . not a quiet place....,"February 12, 2019"
"Our room in the Alii tower overlooked the beach and was quietly comfortable.We were well connected to the rest of Waikiki by the pink trolley line with a stop outside the hotel.There are so many restaurants on site that you hardly need to leave the village.The pools were lovely,the beach clean and well maintained as were the grounds.The Alii tower had its own private pool and some extra on property benefits.The Luau was great and staff excellent.All of this made for a lovely comfortable stay in Honolulu just a step away from the more touristy section of Waikiki,which can be a bit overwhelming.","February 11, 2019"
"$45/day self parking fee in addition to the $40/day resort fee. Always consider these fees to get to your “true” nightly rate. Staff and employees are always nice and friendly, however. If you have the free breakfast benefit because of your Hhonors status, you get $10/day per person which will buy you a Venti special beverage at the hotel-owned Starbucks. You will to add from your own pocket if you want a mere donut or bagel or pastry with your drink.","February 11, 2019"
"One of the best experiences I had with a hotel. the location is amazing.The view from the rainbow tower that I stayed was breathtaking and the rooms were huge,cozy, clean and very nice decorated. The reasturants were also really good and the pool looks like a lake. Definately recomented!","February 11, 2019"
We were amazed by the extra charge of $40 per room for resort charge. What a joke!That added $80 per day for rooms fo nothing.Otherwise it was a very good stay.Clean and nice staff. A bit out of the way!,"February 10, 2019"
We stayed in the Grand Wakikian and had a great time with 3 adults and two kids. Plenty of room in the two bedroom suite.My wife loved the washer /dryer and I loved the set up which allowed us to spread out at night. The kids loved the pool and slides! Great food options right around the corner from the hotel. A short trek to downtown attractions but it was still easy enough to get to all the Oahu sights via rental car or walking. ,"February 9, 2019"
"After half a dozen visits, we just keep coming back here. One of the most enjoyable resorts, with a beautiful Hawaiian feel and incredible customer service wherever you turn.Offering a variety of rooms and apartments, with beautifully manicured grounds throughout the resort, choice of shops, restaurants and swimming pools - you are also only a walking distance form the Ala Moana shopping center and Waikiki Beach.This uniquely Hawaiian resort has something for everyone in the family, regardless their age and interests ","February 8, 2019"
This place was pure insanity. So many people. The staff was great but the hotel itself was extremely crowded. Room was a bit dated. Hard to find your way around to certain towers within the complex. I will probably stay somewhere else next time. ,"February 8, 2019"
"I got pregnant here, lol ! We stayed in the rainbow tower and had a nice ocean view! It was clean and comfortable! No complaints really just too long of a walk to get to rooms! Expensive but worth it! Walking distance to shopping and many restaurants!","February 7, 2019"
We spent several days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. I was sadly disappointed about how dated the facility is. It is very crowded. The restaurants are less than outstanding but still expensive. I had a seafood flatbread at the tropics the first night there that tasted mostly like cardboard. The breakfast buffet had a variety of dishes but didn't have much flavor.,"February 6, 2019"
"The grounds of this hotel/village are beautiful. This hotel has its own lagoon and various pools ( I would suggest offering heated pools as the water was very cold in Jan). Also the paradise pool is packed with chairs and chaises that it makes it difficult to walk around. Every single staff member we encountered was very pleasant and helpful, we pre-checked in which made the check in process so much easier as the front desk area can be very busy. This resort is very big with multiple towers, stores, restaurants, etc., but it is SO busy with hoards of people everywhere!! We stayed in the diamond head tower and the rooms were kind of run down, bed was comfy, but the rooms need updating.","February 6, 2019"
"My husband and I stayed at the hotel from 1/23/19 - 2/1/19 with another couple. We had originally booked just a standard room with a king-size bed and resort view. Upon our arrival, we realized our friends had booked in the Ali'i tower which had it's own exclusive pool, among other amenities. We opted to upgrade our room for about $500 and stay in the Ali'i tower. Our view was amazing - we overlooked the Super Pool and could see the ocean. The room was also wonderful; it was spacious and seemed to likely be some of the most updated rooms on the resort. Each morning we received bottled water and K-Cup coffee for our in-room Keurig. Overall, I have 0 complaints about the room or resort as a whole. We loved that there was so many restaurants around and close to the resort. The reason I'm giving this a 3 our of 5 is all because of the service. My husband and I had got back to our room after dinner one night at about 9:30pm to find our AC Vent was leaking water all over the table the coffee maker was sitting on. We called maintenance and they assured us that they would be right up. It took over an hour for somebody to even come up to our room, and another 30-40 minutes for them to fix the issue (keep in mind - it's now 11pm at night) which was extremely loud. The next day, we come back to get ready to leave for dinner to find that our safe would not open as it appeared there was no power to it. I called down to the Service Desk (as it directs you to do right on the safe) and advised there was no power to the safe. 15 minutes later, somebody from Security comes up to our room to look at the safe. He's checking it out and says he cannot fix it and somebody from maintenance will come up. As he was walking out the door, he said to us that he would put the Maintenance request in right away and somebody would be up to our room shortly. 1 hour later, we had heard nothing. We couldn't go anywhere while we were waiting, and all our money was in the safe. We finally called down to the front desk just for them to tell us there was no maintenance request and then they hung up on us. I finally walked down to the desk and spoke with a woman who was so rude. I told her what had been going on, and how we had been waiting for about an hour and 15 minutes at this point just to be told there's no request. She grabbed her phone and spoke to somebody. When she hung up she said 'I'm not sure why you didn't just come down here in the first place. We could have escalated this issue for you'. I expressed my frustrations and displeasure for the nearly 3 hours we spent waiting on Maintenance in the past day, and she didn't give one care in the world. Being in the Customer Service Industry, I would very much expect her to be more apologetic, rather than placing the blame on me. The waitresses we had at Tropics Restaurant were anything but good. Service was slow; we had to wait 45 minutes for a waitress to even come over to our table (which they blamed on 'shift change').Overall, if I go back to O'ahu, I may be looking to see what other hotels are out there.","February 5, 2019"
As Always our stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village was great A beautiful room with a Ocean View Beautiful front desk staff the check in process was fast friendly and helpful You have everything you need at the village I am use to be back soonPlease if you are deciding to come to Hawaii with family this is the place to stay You will be loved by you and your family Aloha great job everyone,"February 4, 2019"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village was outstanding in every way. This was our first trip to Hawaii, and we were thrilled with this hotel. Location and the beach were perfect. Great restaurants and friendly staff members. And wonderful variety of shops. The luau was outstanding as was the fireworks show on Friday night. ","February 4, 2019"
"Some good but mostly disappointingThe Good would have to be the Check in receptionist Jacqualyn, who more than went overboard managing to place two groups of the one family not only in the same Tower, but in adjoining rooms. In addition she managed to obtain this Tower upgrade with exquisite views for minimal cost.Second good was Allen in the Beach Bar & Restaurant, truly a most welcoming, friendly, professional, informative and knowledgeable barman.Concerns would be quality of beds which led to poor sleep and bad shoulder problems, the over the top pricing of water sports at the horribly hard pebble based Lagoon. One could almost fly to the moon with the money they charged for sport equipment hire- stay clear ! Next was the closure of the most popular water park area for children for most of a day with no regards to patrons when someone vomited. My God, could you imagine what else is in the water and there's no ban. The most upsetting would have to be the ignorance, rudeness and lack of any social skills of a large lifeguard called Vezi (?). After ordering my grandson out of the main pool for wearing an inflatable ring with floaties and with his mum in toe, he later allowed others to use similar items. I later queried him why had the kids been able to use them plus a catching ball the previous day and not today, he used his huge size to try and intimidate me. His little associate joined in with more argumentable discourse and then all of a sudden a red headed person in a security outfit appears out of nowhere, aggressively gets into my personal space inches from my face and trys to defend the behaviour of the other two before walking me to the end of the pool to look for a ruling to justify his aggressive stance. However he could not explain the varying interpretations from day to day, a real little man syndrome at play. A further very worrying factor was the double charging of a Drinks Bill at the Restaurant/ Bar on credit card. Two charges, one visit, one credit card - you try and explain, I can't.I recommend the marvellous Hotels on central Waikiki Beach (a lovely children's experience) or those a block back and you will receive the service these Hotels pride themselves on and avoid the Hilton at all costs and they are well and truly over the top for value. .","February 4, 2019"
"Depending on what room you get, it could either be really great or not great at all. I stayed in a room where the bathroom was messed up with a broken shower head, bad water pressure, and bad heat. Colleagues of mine had no complaint about their room. Also, my room keys didn't work on the parking garage the majority of the trip and it caused a huge inconvenience because we kept having to go back to the concierge for help.Overall, nice hotel with multiple restaurants, pools, and bars with an oceanfront property. But, some of the rooms are janky, the customer service was just okay - not great - and it's not as close as other hotels to the main strip in Waikiki. The stay was just whatever.","February 4, 2019"
My wife had a recent stay here! Her room was broken into and had numerous items stolen! There did not appear to be forced entry. The Hotel refused to provide her with information regarding Keypad access to her room. They stated the insurance company would contact her. They did contact her and stated they did nothing wrong and would not pay for any of her loss. They did not have cameras in the halls and their emergency alarm exit doors did not have any sound on them. Stay away from this property.,"February 4, 2019"

"Usually drive through area but decided to stop for coffee and found the woollen mill.Glad we did. What history, what knowledge and what a shame it would be if Australia lost this gem of a place.Tours are at 2pm each day.

"We have been to this hotel about 7-8 times and it’s definitely our favorite. We have tried several other hotels on the beach but this one is the best. There is so much to do right on the resort. Shopping, eating, ice cream, fireworks, pools, etc. The rooms have always been clean and the hotel staff is always helpful and polite. Highly recommend! ","February 3, 2019"
"I have stayed in a number of Hilton-branded properties, from Garden and Hampton Inns to 5* hotels, over the years. This was the single worst experience. As a baseline, I would expect to get a good night's sleep, decent bathroom, decent internet connection, and a good breakfast. This place fails at all of them. Initially, the hotel staff put me up in a room in Diamond Head, right above what they call a ""tapas bar"". This had super-loud live music starting at 9pm and continuing into the night. Jetlagged, I called the reception when it's going to stop. ""10pm, maybe."" So I called at 10.10pm and 10.40pm, to no avail. Subsequently, I got moved to another room in Kalia tower, facing a busy road. This still meant you could not open the window, but was a substantial improvement in terms of noise.The bathrooms are not only different from your usual Hilton, with stone-print plastic cladding and a super-noisy fridge in the restroom, but the latter also had loose toilet.  The internet keeps disconnecting a couple of times an hour on both the ""Meetings"" and ""Honours"" WiFi. The longest interruption of some 15 hours was caused by ""strong winds"", the reception staff explained. Perhaps this is an attempt to accept the $70 per day internet-connectivity-and-nothing-much (""resort"") fee, which the check-in staff try to force even onto Hilton Honours members. Similarly, the multiple hundred dollar per night charge does not extend to a breakfast, which is $30 extra for the usual selection, or $5 per the cheapest pastry in the ""village bakery"". Overall, I would not recommend the village to anyone looking for looking for any of the above.","February 2, 2019"
We stayed in the Lagoon Tower Ocean View room and loved it! Gorgeous views and pretty room. There was plenty to do at the resort but we left almost everyday and did excursions. We didn’t use the pool because they were FREEZING but the lagoon is great. Lots of sea turtles and I was happy to see people give them plenty of space and not swim after them. My only complaint about this resort is the pool temps. I think I may have only seen 5-6 people use it for the whole 8 days we were there. The lagoon is definitely warmer and it’s ocean water!!!!,"February 2, 2019"
"We got an amazing room at the Rainbow Tower with great views, not only of the pristine beach but also of the spectacular fireworks from our balcony. There’s a lot of activities and facilities available- even a post office (we had a package sent from the mainland which arrived during our stay) and photocopy center among the array of shops. Easy to get around but why would you want to leave this paradise? We wished we could have stayed longer!","February 2, 2019"
"We spent a delightful overnight here prior to our cruise of the Hawaiian islands. This is a bustling resort and you really feel like you're on vacation here. We had a great evening capped by their fireworks show on the beach. It was fun just walking around the resort. Check-in and out were efficient and service was excellent. We found the restaurants a bit expensive, especially since we were anticipating the cruise. For breakfast we found their Wiki Wiki Market which had good breakfast sandwiches and coffee at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, I spilled my coffee on the balcony of our room (I made another cup in the room coffee maker). I left a note for the cleaning person about the massive spill. When we left I was looking up at the balconies for our room (there are a lot of buildings at this resort). My husband pointed up and said -- See that balcony with the woman scrubbing the table and chairs - that's it. She got my message.","February 2, 2019"
"My husband and I just returned from staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. He was there for work, but I tagged along. Very glad we payed the extra for an ocean view room -- quite a treat to drink our coffee on the balcony each morning and watch boats and surfers on the ocean. In the future, though, I will be sure to request one of the towers that is closer to the beach/ocean. There are 7 different towers on the property (it is no wonder they call it a ""village""). Our king bed was very comfortable. The room had air conditioning, but honestly we just left our balcony door open most of the time for the fresh air. The beach was crowded on sunny days, but we never had trouble finding a spot to sit since there is plenty of room. They have several pools that also look very nice. They have pool/beach towels that you can use, but they are pretty much just bath towels. When we return, I will likely pack a few of my own beach towels to use. Definitely plan to return one day!!!Only bad thing: Very low quality toilet paper in the rooms! But there are several grocery/convenience stores on the property, so you can easily purchase something better if you'd like! We did.","February 2, 2019"
Actually stayed there in 2017 but never got around to a review which isn't fair because we had a great stay! Loved our balcony view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Lagoon was very unique great pool area and restaurant.,"February 1, 2019"
"My daughter's and I had a girls week at HHV. My youngest had conference to attend and it was at HHV. I'd been to Oahu twice but never stayed at HHV. I thought it rather big and noisy on our 1st day but by end of the week it was our home away from home and we really loved all that it had to offer. We stayed in the Tapa Tower on 28th floor and had a great view of the HHV beach/ocean. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. It was easy to rent a car at HHV, National is on site. There at 3 ABC stores on site and we went to every one to get food, drinks, etc. We had dinner at Tropics twice. While it is a bit expensive, the setting, on the beach, it terrific. Get there early on FR to get a great seat for the Fireworks show which is every FR. On our last day we saw Hawaii 5-0 filming there. I am a huge fan so I was on cloud 9. Great end to a wonderful week!","February 1, 2019"
"Stay away if you want to make your vacation a happy memory. This hotel definitely isn't worth your money.The front desk staff is probably the worst among all the Hilton hotels. Through my check-in and check-out experience, they were consistently incompetent. I waited just for checking in 20 minutes in a line and spent another 10 minutes for them to finish at the counter. They were unbelievably slow, and, to my surprise, no one didn't seem to be aware of frustrations of the guests.Check-out was even worse. It was indeed the worst in my entire life. As a busy business person, I wouldn't have written a critical review like this if I a front desk employee named Lynn L. didn't destroy my mostly enjoyable stay.After waiting for 15 minutes just for checking out, I asked Lynn L. why I had to wait for such a long time. She was like ""do I have to answer your question?"" What????!! Without saying anything, with a grumpy face, she passed a paper receipt to me. I have never met such a rude hotel employee in my entire life. I told her to send the receipt to my email address. In an aggressive tone, she talked back to me saying they had done it already or something. So what? Is it my fault to ask you? There were so many guests in front of the counter, waiting for the incapable staff to do their job. I wonder what kind of people the management of this hotel would be.","February 1, 2019"
"The resort has been around for a long time and is typical of most resorts - especially the pricing of food/drink. We arrived on Jan 22, and found 2 VERY large conventions going on. The only issue with this is that the attendees take over the restaurants and bars, so good luck as a guest getting into anywhere during lunches or happy hours. You may want to check for conferences before you book. Pricing was typically high as most non inclusive are, but after a few days of paying $12 for an egg & cheese English muffin, we strolled off the property a few hundred feet and found an I-hop. The pizza place in the complex has great pizza, but don’t order the exact same one at the tapas bar, you”ll pay double for it. The Italian restaurant upstairs is just okay. Tropics bar food was also ok. The Rocky Japanese steak & tepan restaraunt food was excellent, we went there twice during our 8 day stay. They will ask if you want the steam or fried rice as an option with your meal, the steam rice is part of your meal, the fried is $5 extra for the exact same size which they fail to mention, but it is delicious and recommended. The cooking display by the chefs is excellent. Watch for the guy with the camera that will come and take a couple of pictures of you at your table. He returns around the time you get your bill, and provides you with two pictures in a nice folder that you can purchase for $20. It may be something you like/want, but we didn’t like the fact that your being taken advantage of during dinner time - leave that hustle to the streets. T-shirts, souvenirs, etc can be found every where, but the street vendors and alley way vendors off the property seem to be a better deal. Umbrellas and beach chairs, look for the green ones, they are $16 cheaper than the yellow ones for the daily rate. If you pre-pay for the next day, it’s an additional $10 less for that day. The rooms are comfortable and a good size in the Tappa tower, but they are dated and could use a refresh. Our toilet was loose, and tetered when you used it, and the bathroom vanity wood looked like it was out on the beach getting bleached. We often opt out of daily house keeping as we like to do the responsible environmental thing, and we don’t feel it’s feally that necessary on a daily basis. We had to keep telling the cleaning staff that we didn’t need service, but they seemed to fret about it. 3 days into our stay we got some take out food and was eating out on our balcony when we heard a voice in our room. A large gentlemen In our room Questioned why we hadn’t had housekeeping, when my wife explained why, he said okay and left. He didn’t identify if he was housekeeping management or hotel security. . We brought this incident to the hotel manager on check out as if feel it was not necessary to have someone barge into our room - as well as not even identifying who he was, or why the need to come in as opposed to a phone call/message to the room or a note. We understand - given the Vegas incident that theses types of things may be necessary, but Hilton should execute this in a different manner.","February 1, 2019"
Hotel is very large. We were in the diamond head tower. Room was disappointing. It was clean but outdated. It didn’t run our vacation or anything like that but it was not up to the standards I expect with the name Hilton.Checkin thy gave us grief because we booked the hotel under my wife’s Nickname. rather then the name on her ID. First time we have ever had a problem with that at a Hilton or any other resort. Seemed odd and once again not to the Hilton standard.Pools were nice. Could use more chairs given the sheer size of the property. We found a roof top pool on he last day in one of the buildings. We enjoyed that spot but all the pools were good.Beach is amazing right outside the hotel.The lagoon looked like it would be nice if our kids were there.Rental fees for water sports is pretty crazy... but your in Hawaii.. and they have the goods. Its kinda a given they are going to charge a lot. Other resorts we have been too often have included water sports and then premium water sports at an additional cost.Live music at night was pretty good. Runs till about 10ish???We had to check out prior to our flight but we had the opportunity to use a courtesy suite to freshen up before our flight. That was a cool perk.It’s a bit of a walk to dining outside the hotel but welcome to Waikiki.. it’s a safe enjoyable walk where ever you go on the strip.Coffee shop on site was really good. Lots of shopping right on the resort.Self park was convienent and close. $40/day though on top of the resort fee.We have been to quite a few resorts now in different countries and found compared to other resorts the staff were not as welcoming as in the Mexican or Cuban resorts.All that to be said... the island is beautiful! North shore is worth the drive. We sat on the beach and watched surfers.Would I book here again... probably not... there are so many hotels on the beach to choose from.. I’d try something else... they just did not blow me away... It wasn’t bad per say but just not great and there is plenty of competition to choose from. Outriggers looked great!,"January 31, 2019"

"We upgraded to a room, and they placed us in one with a broken safe, next to a stairwell without a working alarm on the door, despite a sign stating there was one. We were gone for a brief time, and someone entered our room with a key. We had to have been watched because we were gone for such a short period of time. And the broken safe leads us to think a total set-up. Over $5000.00 worth of items were stolen from our room. There are virtually NO cameras in this place other than the lobby areas. There is no security check point to enter the pool areas. This means anybody from off of the street can enter the pool areas (which is easy to do once you see the layout). If they take your child, there will be NO CAMERAS to catch them do it, and they can be off the property within 5 minutes. The hotel was and remains less than helpful. One manager claimed he was too busy to talk to us, and made me beg for toothbrush and paste, shaving cream and razors, and meal vouchers, despite knowing that all of my credit cards and ID were stolen and I only had a limited amount of cash. I never did get the deodorant or comb I requested. The same manager (Antonio) said he was too busy to discuss the issue with us and was accusatory, stating that ""though we looked like honest people, you never know."" The head of guest relations and head of security (Bert and Terry) who I met with the next day, were at first kind. Now I realize they were pandering and lying until I left the property. Don't let looks fool you. This place is beautiful, but it is not safe, especially for women and children. Stay somewhere else for your dream vacation.","January 31, 2019"
"We arrived here from the East Coast after being up for 22 hours. All we wanted to do was go to our room and go to sleep. Unfortunately, their computer system was down and they were unable to check anyone in or give them room keycards. We had to wait around for almost two hours until they texted me that the system was up and they could check us in. If that was the end of it, I would have given them a terrible rating. However, by way of atonement, they comped us two dinners and upgraded our room to a junior suite, which I thought was more than fair. Recommended.","January 31, 2019"
"This Hilton property is an enormous and gorgeous property. The lobby is open air and there are many restaurants and shops in the complex. Also, it is open to the beach and there are zero check points so that anyone can wander in from the beach or any point outside the hotel and make their way up to the rooms. there are ZERO checks to see if you are staying in the hotel. Additionally, there are ZERO security cameras on any of the floors, the elevators, the stairways, etc; The only cameras are int he lobby, but again, there are tons of points of entry other than the main lobby. our room was robbed while we were there and the hotel could not have been less helpful. We called the Honolulu Police Department and even the police officers gave each other looks when the security guys told them that they have no cameras. Someone unlocked our door and helped themselves to our things. We were afraid to stay in the room and had to go to great lengths to get another room - as the hotel manager who kept insisting he was too ""tied up"" to help us. He stated there was no way for him to know if we were honest people and really had been robbed or not! our door was open when we arrived from the beach. Clearly it was an inside job. We were on the 12th floor and our room was beside the stairs/fire exit. I walked down the stairs and at the bottom was a sign saying that it was a fire exit and that an alarm would go off if opened, but I pushed through and there was no alarm. The stairs were right beside a driveway so that someone could easily come in, go upstairs and easily leave from this exit. I am thankful that the only thing that happened was that we lost physical objects. This is a very unsafe place to stay. Anyone can walk right up to your floor at any time from anywhere.","January 31, 2019"
Will start off by saying this resort is huge and not an all inclusive so rather expensive but it is right on Waikiki Beach!! The rooms are a good size and very clean . The staff was very helpful . In close proximity to shopping also. On Friday nights they have fireworks right on the beach . We did have trouble finding a place to eat the Friday night after the fireworks on or near the resort as most of the restaurants were full with line ups . Also wanted to do a shout -out! We had checked out and were in another island and realized I had left my rayban sunglasses in our room. I called the resort and spoke to their lost and found department and my glasses had been turned in !! So thank -you to the person who did that :-),"January 30, 2019"
"The grounds are beautiful. The Hilton Hawaiian village is truly a Village within Waikiki. There are shops, koi ponds, waterfalls, a lagoon, and much more on the campus of this hotel. Its about a 8 minute walk to the center of Waikiki, but trust me, you'll be happy you have the distance. Unless you're in Waikiki to buy LV handbags or a new Rolex, stay at the Hilton. The only thing to note...the Diamond Head tower needs a Renovation...badly. It is not a 4 star room. One of our party stayed there and had to move rooms. Other towers are great and the classic Rainbow tower is still my favorite. The beach is great and the staff is good. Nothing to complain about. If you must stay in Waikiki center, stay at the Sheraton. If not, the Hilton Village is the best property on Waikiki.","January 29, 2019"
This is an amazing resort on so many acres. The view from the room was amazing and the fire works on a friday night was wonderful to watch from our balcony. Hilton have done it well with the best placement of this resort in Waikiki and what you see is what you get here. Pools are great - one is heated. Shops and restaurants nearby and just a short walk up to the main area of waikiki at night is terrific.,"January 29, 2019"
"Our family (2 adults, kids 11 and 9) had a great time staying here recently. It is a great way to enjoy resort style accommodation whilst also being based in Waikiki. The resort has numerous pools, a beach that never felt too crowded and a lagoon with water sports. The food and drink was great too. with Tropics restaurant/bar and the acai bowls from the juice bar being the highlights.It is a 10-15 minute walk into Waikiki, depending on how fast you can get your kids to walk and depending on where you want to get to. It's an easy walk, but by the end of our 7 night stay, we found it was just that bit too far away to feel like we had lots of variety for dinner (or breakfast).That is the only negative I would provide however, it is a great place to stay, just understand you won't be in the heart of the action.","January 29, 2019"
"Though i chose a three days stay through third party website, reservation was messed up with two back to back reservations for the 3 days stay. After two days of first reservation ,though we could continue for the 3rd day with second reservation in the same room, we were locked out of our room when we returned in the evening after our outing. It was frustrating to call the correct help desk after steering through the automated dialing, who sent the security to open the room. Though i specifically chose the full ocean view room by opting out the cheaper 'partial' ocean view room, we were allotted a partial ocean view room from where we could only see tall buildings unless we get into balcony to peep the ocean view.The front desk operator responded that the building view room is classified as ocean view room and i have to settle to that.However, the manager of reservation of Hilton was very nice to change our room to a full ocean view room for the second and third day.But for the above, the stay was excellent,enjoyable and i would strongly recommend the Hotel.To choose room and have digital room key in advance and to avoid long line at the check in , it is better to reserve through the hotel site","January 29, 2019"
"Jonathon the Guest Services Agent was AMAZING to say the least! Was super kind, super insightful, great smile & personality! Great representation of Aloha Spirit and Hilton’s world wide! Thank you for making my stay incredible!","January 29, 2019"
"These apartments were a great choice for our base for my friends bachelor party.Nice pool area, right on the beach, nice jacuzzi, great rooms.Shops and restaurants are all in reasonable walking distance or a short taxi ride away.I would recommend and I would return.","January 28, 2019"
We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (Tapa Tower-partial ocean view) for the first time in August 2017. Enjoyed the resort very much with so much to do. Trolley stops are close by. Returned for a family wedding in November 2018. We booked right away (Kalia Tower-ocean view).Fifteen walk to the Ala Moana Center. Huge mall. I recommend staying here. ,"January 28, 2019"
"Being Hilton I thought it would be a better standard. We stayed in the Tapa tower and while the rooms were reasonably spacious the rooms including the furniture were so old it was embarrassing. The beds are all double and uncomfortable, so all the families sleep is terrible. I’m not kidding but the lounge, lamps ands draws all look like they have come from a second hand furniture joint.If you must visit Honolulu the location is good and the choice of pools is also cool,but that’s it. ABC stores are handy, all other restaurants are way overpriced. Can’t wait to holiday on the Great Barrier Reef for our next holiday for half the price and a fantastic modern condo.","January 28, 2019"
This is a premier Hilton facility with modern and clean accommodations. We had a balcony with ocean view that was stunning. There were great restaurants and shopping at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and it is right on the beach. Great nightly live entertainment also and even a fireworks show on Friday evening.,"January 28, 2019"
"We stayed in a suite in the Rainbow tower at the Hilton Hawaiian village for our wedding anniversary. It was a wonderful experience and the resort has a bit of everything. PROS:Very large property with a variety of activities. Friday night fireworks were spectacular with the ocean as a backdrop.Multiple restaurants on site, including Starbucks Rainbow tower right next to the beach. Temporary room available for an hour if your accommodation room isn't ready View from the room was stunning (see pics)CONS:The restaurants prices were extremely inflated, compared to food outside of the resort.Check in was extremely busy during peak timesCustomer service was good, but not consistently good ","January 28, 2019"
Was very excited to stay here tried to book ocean front and were told they only have ocean view which is ocean front. When we arrived they offered us to up grade to ocean front.. for 75 a night which by the way is after we already thought we paid for it. Also the resort fee and the parking coming to over a 100 a night. I do t even know what you get for the resort fee towels? Because the beaches are public the restaurants are expensive. The room we were in was right next to the elevator and very noisy beds are uncomfortable pillows are terrible. I feel like the hotel is run down and needs remodeled. For the price to stay here you can stay at a nicer hotel for less money and a better view just to the east I will never return. ,"January 27, 2019"
"This is our second stay this time with the teenagers!!! . We stayed in the Kalia tower which was perfect, kitchen and lounge area!! Plenty of room for the four of us.Great pools and beach swimming.Round table has the best pizza, but otherwise recommend eating off site!! Waikiki has so much to offer.It’s a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and a15 min walk into downtown!!Service and staff are friendly","January 27, 2019"
"The resort grounds are beautiful, the beach is probably the nicest in Waikiki. Walking distance to all the good spots, decent restaurants on property. The Friday fireworks on the beach are cool, especially if you have rainbow tower ocean front rooms. The Rainbow bazaar has lots of shopping and an ABC store for whatever you forgot to bring.","January 27, 2019"
We stayed (2 adults and 2 kids) at the Hawaiian Village for a week. The resort was very nice and the room we had was spacious. There were plenty of options to eat outside of the resort within walking distance. The outlet mall Aloha Moana was also within walking distance which made it easier to do a big shop. The only thing that you need to be prepared for is that it is crowded especially if you are taking the kids to the pool. You really need to get in early to secure seats etc. We ended up just going to the beach instead as the pool was just too crowded. However overall I would recommend this as a place to stay when visiting Hawaii.,"January 27, 2019"
"This hotel is WAY over priced, rundown, crowded, and loud. This is definitely not a relaxing hawaiian experience. The rooms are out dated, furniture is in need of repairs, water pipes make loud noises, and we kept finding bugs in the bathroom. The balcony view is is great except you can't enjoy it peacefully due to the constant traffic noises, music playing, and loud speaker noise from constant events. The food at the on site restaurants is blah at best and astronomically over priced. The fees for everything are over priced and ridiculous!","January 27, 2019"
"Came here on my honeymoon whilst pregnant and had the worst time. The staff are snobby and un helpful.I suffer with overheating as part of my pregnancy and the staff do not care. They have an air con system that is rubbish, doesn’t keep the room cool and just rattles. When rung reception to ask for a fan and explain that I amPregnant overheating and struggling to sleep (all of which a pregnant lady doesn’t need) they simply say so because they have air con and hang up- you would think for the price you pay to be here the staff would look after you, but they couldn’t care less. It’s a shame because it ruined myHoneymoon as I was constantly tired, hot and therefore upset.Won’t ever come back here to such an unaccomodating hotel","January 27, 2019"
"This is one property that we have visited over the years. They had some maintenance and service challenges in the past... after all it is a huge property. Their trouble must have been when they were purchased by a private equity firm.The last two visits have been excellent. They've been friendly, efficient, and a pleasure to stay with.","January 26, 2019"
"From the moment we arrived, all we got was amazing service! Every staff member was friendly and helpful. We arrived early, our room wasn’t ready but they said they would text when it was. This was probably within 1hr. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower and the view out towards the beach and diamond head was amazing! The room was comfortable. The resort is huge and didn’t feel overcrowded, even though we were there with the conference group. There’s a lot of space for everyone. There are 4 public pools and one of the pools we had to ourselves at one stage. Every pool we found somewhere to put our stuff, even the busy family pool with slides. All the food places onsite are expensive, but there are plenty of places in the surrounding areas that are cheap. We spent an afternoon at the lagoon, right next to the resort with paddle boards and that was heaps of fun! We loved this place and would not hesitate to stay here again.","January 26, 2019"
"The Rainbow Tower @ Hilton Hawaiian Village was heavenly! The perfect way to spend my birthday! The views were terrific and the sunrises/sunsets breathtaking. I enjoyed participating in many of the hotels activities and found the pool area as well as the beach very relaxing. Hotel staff and shop staff were warm and friendly and I enjoyed watching lots of bridal parties prepping for their big days! Overall, a very joyful experience.","January 26, 2019"
"We stayed at this resort for a conference for three nights. We were very disappointed. Our ocean view room looked sideways over three buildings for a limited ocean view. Not totally unexpected but...The room in the Tapa tower was spacious but very tired with large gouges in the walls, peeling wallpaper, popcorn ceiling, hard bed, old sinks and bathroom fixtures. The hot water went from warm to scalding a dozen times in the shower, the towels smelled like disinfectant as if they were new and never washed before. The pools and beach are packed, the restaurants and shops are very overpriced, even for Hawai'i, and to get an umbrella and one beach chair it is an extra $50 per day. At over $450 per night I would expect a bit more. Very, very disappointed in Hilton and the resort. I would not stay here again nor recommend it to anyone, Fortunately there are many other good options in Waikiki. They may not be cheaper, but it would not be hard to get more for your money.","January 25, 2019"
"We had a really nice suite/apartment. The beach is lovely and it's a pleasant walk to all restaurants, etc. in Waikiki. That's the good part. I wouldn't stay at the Hilton again, though. The on sight restaurants are mediocre at best and the common areas are way too limited for the number of people they pack into them. The pool was a joke -- packed, like old-time pictures of Coney Island in August. Not relaxing at all.","January 25, 2019"
The pools were beautiful the lagoon is spectacular!!!! However we asked for “ ocean view” what we got was full lagoon view ocean peek. The rooms are not that updated. But most hidden is the fact they want to tie a credit card to each room for 90 $ a day we stayed 7 nights rented 3 rooms so that’s 1890$. Of course if you don’t use their “ put it on my room “ services they credit it back to you. But seriously this was BS. The biggest disappointment is after all this money spent to stay there the Hilton Hawaiian Village does not allow any bus pick up or drop off out front for excursions out in town - you have to hike half a mile to the grand islander bus depot out back. It’s ridiculous. Had I known this I’d have stayed somewhere else for sure. Any place I pay to stay at I surely should be able to be picked up and dropped off at the FRONT of the hotel. ,"January 24, 2019"
"Spectacular room, view, and service. We enjoyed the entire property and the ability to be able to prepare dinner in our own kitchen or walk to the number of fine restaurants on the property, or the multitude down the street along Waikiki beach. ","January 24, 2019"
"Easy check-in as a Hilton Gold member. I was upgraded to Rainbow tower without asking(pleasantly surprised). Very nice staff at desk and conceirge. Pools were clean, and not overly busy. The room was clean and spacious, and a nice comfortable bed. I would stay here again if the price was right. ","January 23, 2019"
"This isnt the first Hilton Ive had issues with but will be the last, ill go back staying with the Hyatt or Sheraton Hotels now, I even stayed at Hiltons top end hotels like the Logan and wasnt impressed for the money.Besides requesting at time of booking connecting rooms and one room with two beds, it never happened and that was just the start. When we checked in, we were told we did not have connecting rooms or one room with two beds and the hotel was fully booked, we even showed the booking to which we were told, ""You had to pay an addition fee to garuntee you get it"" Why were we not told that at time of booking? Again not told of the construction taking place either. Staff were rude and not overly helpful or friendly, except for the resturant closest to the whalf they rocks especially on NYE. I need to get the video to upload of the dirt in the rooms, you could write your name in the dust, the shower broke in my brother room, the bathrooms are tiny and have no water pressure or exhaust fan, again no mini bar, when trying to book activities staff were not helpful in making suggestions if something you picked was booked out, with there now being 7 towers, you feel like your in a city all hemed in but buildings not on a beautful island beach side. Both my brother and I are still waiting returned calls from staff about room upgrades and changing tickets to event (we ended up calling the company direct) The room next to my mother and I must of had friends down the hall and their door would slam all the time. What made that worse was it shared a connecting door with our room! Overall not impressed.","January 23, 2019"
"Swimming in the ocean, relaxing on the beach, laying by the pool, listening to the daily live music, walks on the beach, seeing the sunrise over Diamond Head... These are a few of my favorite things here....","January 23, 2019"
My wife and I went to Hawaii from different countries. She made a mistake with the timezone and ended up arriving at Honolulu at 8am. The arrival time of the flight of mine is 9pm! She got to the hotel around 10am and was able for an early check in. This is a big plus. I would gave a 5 if the hot water hadn't gone out at my last day there. I was told the entire floor had the problem and should be fixed within 1 hour. After 1 hour I tried and still not working. Very disappointing. Otherwise it was a nice stay for us.,"January 23, 2019"
"Very busy, very big and very noisyAlot of people coming and goingRooms are big, a bit datedService is great especially the car peopleFood too expensive eat somewhere elseBeach is nice but they charge you a resort fee and a beach chair fee which is kind of a rip","January 23, 2019"
Third visit to resort and last were not told at check in a conference was happening in main bar and pool area therefore general public unable to use.noise to extreme with over 1000 people attending conference unable to get lifts for ages.Hotel staff didn’t seem to care everyday clients seemed to be more of a nunsiance to staff.A lot of money to get here for a ruined holiday,"January 22, 2019"
"1st time visit to Hawaii with 2 kids and grand parents and the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort is a great place to stay because it had every thing you needed in 1 place. Easy to get around because Waikiki is only a small island. This Hotel is alive and great for family fun.But because the grounds so big, anyone can turn up there and use there swimming pool and etc, and then there's the PTC conference that was organized there. We couldn't get into lifts because there was so many people for hours, couldn't get around( walking from one side to another) and the conference people were rowdy and loud. We even ask the people please be quiet outside our hotel room. The staff is great, very friendly but some lobby staff didn't know how to direct us to certain places eg. gym and kids club( village green).We will return next time but maybe a different period as we don't want the PTC conference to ruin a great holiday for the kids.","January 22, 2019"
"First we are Hilton Honor members, which really does not matter at this resort. Be prepared for Two additional fees. One is a 45 per day parking fee the other is $40 resort fee. The hotel itself is a historic landmark. It has been updated several times over the years. You will pay extra for Oceanview. The plus side of this hotel is it is literally right on the beach. There are many activities that the resort provides free of charge exercise classes, yoga, hula, And ukulele classes. They have a great spa and Gym. It is congested and very busy. Checking in and checking out can come with long waits in lines.","January 22, 2019"
"I visit each year for the PTC conference in January and would love to stay somewhere else, but it's just so convenient having a room on-property. BUT:* No proper room service - just takeaway deliveries.* No Hilton Diamond benefits (room upgrade / free breakfast - was given a $10 a day dining credit but can only be used at very limited outlets and not at the main breakfast location).* Very poor sound insulation - crying baby in next room woke me up.* No hot water one evening - was fixed in a couple of hours, but too late to grab a shower before dinner meeting, so had to have a cold one,* Tropics Bar is lovely - but they can't provide a Latte 'cos ""we don't have a microwave"" so no hot milk.* If I recognise staff that have been here for years and can address them by name then its perhaps not unreasonable of me to expect that once they are reminded of my name then they'll address me that way.* I've been coming here at least once a year for over twenty years - surely not too much to get a ""welcome back"" comment when I check in.* What is a ""Resort Charge"" at $40 a day? That gets me stuff that I don't need and don't want (""cultural activities"" and ""free"" WiFi that I get anyway with Hilton HHonors.This hotel isn't cheap cost-wise but seems ""cheap"" in so many ways.... If it wasn't for the conference venue and great views at sunset I'd definitely stay somewhere else.","January 22, 2019"
"The hotel/resort has great facilities, the staff are excellent and the swimming pools are lovely, however it was just way too busy for our liking! (apparently it was running at full occupancy). The waterslide pool was overun with children (i counted 27 people in the spa) and the pool chairs are jammed together like sardines making it not overly relaxing! The smaller pools, such as the one in the Kalia tower was much quieter. We found our room on the 25th floor of the Kalia tower to be nice and quiet and we had a great view of the ocean, however the rooms are appearing a bit tired, especially considering the cost.","January 21, 2019"
"First trip to Hawaii. We stayed in two towers during our week stay here. The first tower was the Grand Waikikian. It was very quiet and the 1 bedroom suite was spacious. Unfortunately this tower is a timeshare tower and you do get the sales pitch from activities staff to sit through a 90min talk...which we refused. If I wanted to sit through a lecture I would not have come on holidays. The next tower we stayed in was Ali'i in a 1 bedroom suite on the top floor. Lovely spacious room with 2 bathrooms, however despite the room description on the Hilton website listing a balcony we did not have any! The air conditioning units are noisy compared to the Grand Waikikian and despite maintenance attempting to fix the unit it is clear the air conditioning units in the entire building need upgrading not to mention the windows and sliding doors need to be replaced with triple glazing to block out the sound of the bar/hotel next door. The Ali'i pool is nice as is the private pool bar. The location and views are superb right on the beach. Tip. Check your suite/upgrade has an actual balcony before paying extra for this room type.","January 20, 2019"
"Beautiful hotel/village. Such a big resort, that you could spend a week and not need to leave other to go out and do some adventures like diving, hiking, or zip lines. Fireworks can't be beat. Hilton Beach is directly under the show, so you got front row views. Pools are awesome. The beach side lagoon is great for letting little ones get sandy and have some beach time without the waves. Access to Waikiki shopping, buses for adventures, dock's for submarine and day cruises are excellent.Only downside was cost to value. Everything is a little too expensive for what you get. Example; breakfast in the room was $50 for an omelette with some potatoes, which tasted average and showed up in a plastic bag, recycled clam shell to-go box, plasticware. $50= $28 omelette + $10 delivery charge + $8 Service charge + Tax, then a tip for the server if you prefer. For $50, I expect a plate, tin cover, silverware, a cloth napkin, and quality food. For an iHop to-go bag, I expect to pay $20-30 max, delivered. Pool side service was fast and friendly, but food was overpriced theme park quality. Parking at $40 a day. Front desk was not knowledgable of the events. We arrived on a Friday, which is fireworks night and thus no Lua. We asked if they would still have a hula show or fire dance show, but the employee said no, the fire dance was a must-see for us, and about 10 minutes before fireworks, as we are buried in the crowd on the beach, we see the fire dance show occurring in the distance pool side... so we missed it. Overall our stay was Ok. If food quality/service was better for the price, we would have bumped this up to a 4. If the staff did not misinform us on our must-see event, we would have bumped it up another.","January 20, 2019"
"This hotel is like 3rd world when it comes to basic services, like WiFi in the room. $20 per night for WiFi is totally outrageous and compares to many hotels where it is complimentary. Big and impersonal hotel. ","January 20, 2019"
"Our stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Ali’i Tower was wonderful. The ocean views from our room was spectacular. The room was spacious, clean and well maintained. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The whole complex has so many places to eat, shop or enjoy the sun. You don’t have to leave the grounds to have an enjoyable stay. You are also within walking distance to get out and enjoy all the other Waikiki attractions. Mahalo. ","January 19, 2019"
"Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm friendly Aloha, our bags were taken care of and we could make our way to the Ali’i tower. Greeted with another warm welcome we were able to check in first thing in the morning for a small fee and were able to enjoy every minute of our stay. Our room was very spacious and very clean. The beachfront view is magical, and the beach was inviting and child friendly. The lagoon offered hours of fun with various activities and the kids enjoyed the waterslides. I highly recommend the hire of a beach umbrella and a chaise or 2 as most days are spent watching the world go by in a wonderful location. It was very easy to relax, unwind and leave the daily stresses behind. We will definitely be coming back to this little slice of heaven. ","January 19, 2019"
"We chose the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki because it was called a Resort. Do not be fooled. There is nothing Resort about this place. The rooms are spacious, the staff is gracious but it feels like I am standing in Times Square with thousands of tourists every time I walk out of my hotel room.  There is a beautiful beach and a lovely lagoon but there are no lounge chairs on the beach and no lounge chairs around the Lagoon unless you want to pay an outside concession $18 a day per chair. This is not a resort, it's a rip-off to have to pay $252 plus tips just to sit on the beach. Our room was in the Kalia Tower. We had a lovely terrace facing the ocean. Since there are no queen beds in this building, we were offered a king room without a view or this room with two double beds with this spectacular view. Two double beds is something out of the 1980s. The room should have been upgraded years ago. Although it is spacious and very clean, the furniture, the carpets, and the bathroom are old. There is a safe, a small refrigerator, that is in the bathroom and the water is hot in the pressure is good. The hotel is in a great location but I would not recommend staying here. I'm sure there are nicer places to stay in Waikiki Beach.","January 19, 2019"
Hilton in Waikiki was great and they have a wide range of facilities for every guest and there is always something going on.At times it did get over crowded and the restaurants had ok food which this can be improved on. Overall great stay,"January 18, 2019"
This was our 2nd time in three years staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Both times we stayed in the Rainbow Tower. We had an ocean view right at the end of the hallway with a spectacular view of Diamond Head. Once again the facilities did not disappoint us and the staff were generally very friendly. We even got to watch them film a scene from Hawaii Five-0 near the main hotel pool...with the two lead actors! It was all very exciting for the guests to watch this!,"January 18, 2019"
What better way to wake up in Hawaii then seeing the sunrise over Diamond Head! This property is right on the beach! We would walk steps from pool to beach and be able to have the best of both worlds! Property has options for food and shopping. We had a great 6 night stay! ,"January 18, 2019"
"When I checked in, the bell was very crowded and I ended up carrying my luggage to my room by myself. I needed to go out and wasn't able to wait a boy. Other than that, it was a nice place to stay and get relaxed.","January 18, 2019"
"Our room had a balcony with a spectacular view of the sea and the city. The room was nice and comfortable. The hotel has several separate towers. Unfortunately, my sisters were in a different tower, which made it difficult for us to get together. We only ate there once because the prices were very high.","January 17, 2019"
"Donna at the front desk did a great job checking us in, super friendly, and as a Diamond member, I ended up getting an upgrade to the rainbow tower, which was absolutely amazing. We did go in the off season, so that probably helped. Be advised, the property is very crowded, so if you are looking to avoid crowds and people, this is not the place. But overall we were very happy with the property, and everyone there treated us great. Rainbow tower view was absolutely amazing.","January 17, 2019"
"Our room was comfortable enough but looked like it could use refurbishing. The resort was very crowded, but not too noisy. Food is expensive everywhere. Because we wanted to visit Pearl Harbor and this resort is at the west end of Waikiki, we chose to stay here. ","January 16, 2019"
"This hotel is one of my favorite hotels in the world!!! I love the views, the staff is very friendly and accommodating. My room was spectacular and the food is amazing!!! This is my second time staying here and I will definitely be here many more times!!!!!","January 16, 2019"
We enjoyed staying at the Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort for the HICE conference. The view from the room was oustanding and the managers and conceirge were extremely helpful with any questions that arose during the stay.,"January 16, 2019"
We stayed in Penthouse room 2470 lagoon tower. 3bedroom. Looks beautiful..BUT...OH MY GOODNESS youd think quiet and have a sweet rest...NO quite the opposite. Our room beside the lifts. The elevator shaft motors are in the ceiling and very loud.the master suite is right next door and its relentless from about 5am onwards.met a family with young children staying across the hall and they said the same and all are exhausted too. Wont stay here again. Such a shame as we love hawaii.,"January 16, 2019"
"The answer is, when it is not the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. This once tropical paradise has turned into a substandard Disneyworld resort. The hotel was sold, presumably to a bunch of lawyers, with the sole intention to vacuum as much money from their “guests” at the lowest cost.When you used to arrive, the lobby would overlook Waikiki beach and the Pacific. The new “management” removed all the furniture and plants from this huge lobby, so it now has the ambience of a subway station. We were greeted with the traditional Hilton Welcome, “sorry sir, we do not have your room”. The staff was kind enough to get a chair for me to sit on while they went thru the inventory for over one hour.There is no relationship between cost and service rendered. Originally, the hotel was built by Henry Kaiser and had about 500 rooms. The grounds and pool, and restaurants were designed for that number of rooms. Now, there are 3400 rooms with the same facilities, so in the morning, the 8 to 10 thousand guests flock to two hotel restaurants, clearly unable to serve a crowd this size. One of the two restaurants serving breakfast had a 30 minute line, with half of the tables empty. I asked, what passed for a manager, April, “why are these people waiting, with half of the tables empty?” Like a true Disney Martinet, she responded “they will be served when we have a table”. I repeated the question and got the automaton to respond the same. As we continued, she decided to call Security, so for $500 a night I was asked to leave, and not come back. This industry is known as hospitalityThe other choice is a buffet, which is a convenient $40 a head plus tax and tip. This also had an impressive line. This morphed into the convenient $100 breakfast. There are one or two independent food facilities in the Village, with better food, at less than obscene prices, but these are also packed with people.New Year’s Eve they outdid themselves. We called for a reservation ($169ea) at the steak restaurant, but the phone went unanswered. We went there at 8:10 and were told that they close at 9 and half of the table were empty, and we had no reservations. Obviously they want us to think that all these guests show up for a fast holiday meal. So it was down to the buffet ($69). We were told to eat fast as the place closed at 9. It didn’t matter as they ran out of food.The pool, with some 200 chairs for 8000 guests, were always occupied by sun screen and flip flops. The daily $41”resort fee” covers two towels and the resort-This consisted mainly of searching for a place to sit. They saved in the garden, with half dead bromeliads, weeds and brown leafs. We have healthier plants in NY. Want to enjoy Waikiki?-no problem an umbrella and two chairs are over $100. Want the Diamondhead view, that is gone also, there is now an apartment built on the beach to obscure the view. This pseudo Hilton is now a tourist trap, from the mobs of people to the $50/day parking, it reeks of hello sucker. Instead of writing 2000 apologies on Trip Advisor, they should fix those things. I am a guest, my business is not hotel management is the Hilton’s business..","January 16, 2019"
This hotel has it all! It is like a little town in itself. With ABC mart close by and the swimming areas for the kids it is a great stay! I loved waking up to see the penguins in the morning and bird watching. The lagoon made for perfect pictures.,"January 16, 2019"
"We spent 6 nights at the village and walk away very pleased with memories we will have forever. I traveled with my two children and 78 year old mother so the village was perfect as everything was at your finger tips. We arrived on the early flight at 700am and the staff were very attentive and happy to allocate a room for our early arrival but there was a price to check in. At that stage we didn't care, we just wanted to sleep and relax. I cannot fault the hotel staff. Extremely friendly and helpful. Service was amazing at every point of the village. The towel system was fantastic. Restaurants and Cafes were all great also with a very big variety of international cuisine. They even have a fish and chip shop! Theres a ABC shop to grab your snacks and treats was great for those little things you need on a trip. And for the parents, lets not forget about Starbucks in one of the towers for your morning takeaway coffee. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower after receiving a upgrade due the noise from centre pools bar. Younger families be mindful of asking for the pool view as you will hear the bands up until 11pm at night. The view from the Rainbow Tower is spectacular! Fire works ""unbelievable"" they seem to go on for hours. Entertainment they offer makes you feel like yes money well spent. The pools can be somewhat overcrowded but the beach and lagoon are right there also. We would swap and change depending on the crowd situation. If you need to hire boards, chairs, umbrellas, the staff are all amazing and if you're lucky they will even carry your gear to the beach. Thanks Hilton for our stay, very memorable and we cant wait to visit again. Travel date was Dec 2018. ","January 15, 2019"

"We stayed in the Alii Tower as Hilton members. There is a private pool on the second floor along with the larger main pool by the beach which is for all guests in all the towers and they also have their own check-in, so no long lines waiting to get to your rooms. Alii also has a nice restaurant on the beach. Very nice rooms with balconies. The Village property as a whole has numerous restaurants and shops. We liked eating breakfast at the Deli. Very nice beach area with a walkway connecting the other hotels. Makes for a very nice walk along the beach. Also there are carryout type stores around the whole Village if you need anything. We would highly recommend this Hilton property because it offers everything. The only thing I'm not sure about is parking since we did not have a car.","January 15, 2019"
I have stayed at The HHVWBR several times about 8 years ago while on a working assignment. Stayed in Tapa tower which was very nice. I always wanted to stay in the Rainbow Tower-the iconic trademark of Waikiki Beach. The Resort overall is nice but the Rainbow Tower is so very old and is need a big time makeover! ,"January 15, 2019"
" For the money, you get so much more from the Hilton resort on the big Island. The room decor was a bit dated and the beds were not too comfortable. You have to pay premium for everything, even internet. Parking was $50 a day and Internet was $30 a day even for Hilton honors members. Don’t get me wrong, it’s Hawaii and Hawaii is amazing but for the money, I was expecting a little more from this resort. ","January 15, 2019"
"I stayed for 7 days at this property in January 2019. The facilities are very nice. Service is relatively poor. Housekeeping was slow (and didn't come twice.) The beach resort fee does not give you anything. For the price, the resort behaves as if towels were made of gold. The beach is nice, but rocky. Bring water shoes. I would say: Imagine if a cruise ship ran aground, this is what the resort is like. Big, crowded, spread out. There are all the activities you would want to do, surfing, snorkling expedition, SUP, kids activities, etc. All of them are good, but over priced. The concierge desk is very unhelpful. Not much use asking them for help with a non-property reservation or idea for activity. Friday fireworks were awesome. In all, it was nice, just not a good value. For the price, service should be top notch. Here, it was not, just OK.","January 15, 2019"
"This is a great place to stay if you don’t necessarily want to leave the grounds, however, don’t expect great service or lower than average Hawaii prices. There are a LOT of Tourists, specifically Korean and Japanese.Grounds - they are quite large, something like 22,000 acres, 8 towers, a number of pools, restaurants, and shops. Great beach access. Very lush with lots of coy ponds and small waterfall features. You really don’t have to leave, as there is plenty to do and decent variety. It is big, so if you prefer more intimate resorts, and things in close proximity, this resort probably isn’t for you. There are about 4 pools. They do NOT have a designated adult pool and there are quite a lot of children. 2 jacuzzis and they close at 7pm, which is weird. There is a quiet pool on the 4th floor of the Kalia tower (where the spa is) that’s not as lush, but quieter. There’s also a jacuzzi there. Fitness room is also there and it’s the only one unless you’re staying in the Alii tower. So, it’s a bit of a walk from the other towers, which I found inconvenient as we stayed in the Diamond Head tower. They do have fireworks on Fridays and a nice Hawaiian show prior. It can get VERY packed with people trying to watch. Nice to have a room with a balcony that you can see both from, without having to deal with the crowds. We were able to do this at the rainbow tower from our friends room.Service - as others have mentioned, service is sub-par. We had an incident at check in that started us off on the wrong foot and noticed underwhelming service to be a trend. When we were checking in, my friend was telling the employee how excited he was that it was his first time here, and his plans, etc...she had the audacity to say “you’re giving me too much information, I don’t need to know all that.” He said, “Excuse me??? I’m sorry, I thought you were in customer service, but I’ll make sure to take it up with your manager.” I was shocked. However, they did end up upgrading us to a junior suite, which turned out to be ok. Check in took about 30 mins. Our friends also had an issue checking in. They weren’t given the room they paid for through their travel agency and apparently it took almost 3 hrs of phone calls to resolve. Another instance of poor check in process. The previous reviews are correct in that customer service is not a strong point at this resort. Possibly due to its size. So if you prefer exemplary service for the prices you’re paying, this may not be the spot for you. Service at restaurants is similar, with few exceptions, like Brian at Tropics. He was very nice, attentive, and prompt.Rooms - they do seem a bit dilapidated and in need of touch ups. Our junior suite room in the Diamond Head tower was ok. The suite living room was dark, but the balcony was nice and large with a great view. Closet was too small to put my suitcase in. Furniture, as well as paint on walls, was chipped. Carpet in hallways seemed worn. Just little updates that could go a long way. Air conditioner was also a bit loud. They also had mentioned that this tower was the most newly renovated. I have a feeling they coach them to say certain things because we went to a friends room in the rainbow tower, and those rooms were much newer and more fresh looking. Prices - you’re certainly paying for the grounds here, not a fancy room. Parking is $45 per night in addition to $35 resort fee. There are about 3 Starbucks locations on site, but keep in mind they are a bit pricier than normal. Grande black coffee is $4. They do have a a juice and açaí bowl place that has some good, quick, healthy options for about $10-12. Wiki Market does as well. We really enjoyed Fresco which is the Italian restaurant. There’s also a couple ABC markets that you can get some great fresh, ready made breakfast, lunch or even small dinner items for under $10. Remember, it’s Hawaii, nothing, especially on a resort, is going to be cheap. Skip the buffet, it’s $30 per person for continental and $40 for hot breakfast, and didn’t look appetizing. Tropics had decent breakfast options for about $20 a piece.Overall, would I stay here again...maybe?? As I liked the grounds and the ability to stay on site and not get bored. But you’re likely sacrificing in other areas.","January 14, 2019"
This resort is amazing. They have fireworks every Friday for their guest. All the staff that I had made contact with are all friendly and helpful. We will be staying again real soon. We enjoyed our stay.,"January 14, 2019"
We had so much fun me and my girls the beach was a blast the pools and Jacuzzis was to die for we had so much fun swimming and they was laughing so much they just saying thanks Mom I didn't even know it's was Labor Day weekend I just decided to take them to Hawaii so we just headed to the airport while I was at the airport I BOOK our hotel here we are coming back if u ever thinking about coming it's a lil pricey but well worth your money,"January 14, 2019"
Large room with ocean views. The property has three different swimming pools as well as a beach on the ocean front.The large Aloa Moana Sopping Centre is an easy walk. Similarly there a large number of easy restaurants are within walking distance.,"January 13, 2019"
"If I could rate minus 10 I would what a joke . Paying 5 star and receive 2 star accomodation ... rooms old , service is poor , only double beds , my husband is sleeping on a roll away at a cost of $75 per night ... so called managers at the Hilton have no idea about customer service , think twice before booking ","January 12, 2019"
"Wow, where to begin... This place is GIGANTIC and that is not a positive. It always felt like an amusement park without the fun. We got lost trying to find the lobby and pretty much everything else at first. We asked for an upgrade at check in and got quite the sales pitch (if you have the option to upgrade via an email offer I would do it then as those are much cheaper). We ended up in a partial ocean view room in the Ali'i tower. The room was nicely furnished and we did have a decent view. Bathroom and closet were spacious as well. Beds were horrible - it felt like sleeping on a stone bench and I woke up sore every morning. The rooms seemed better insulated and therefore quieter than regular hotel rooms which was nice. Service is a real low point at this resort though. Almost every employee we encountered was rude or acted like we were burdening them. We had to call every single day, sometimes multiple times per day, to request (complimentary) water bottles; I witnessed a concierge tell a guest that he would not book her tickets to a show (literally his job); after checking out I was denied a bottle of water for our trip to the airport. I was expecting a lot more for a resort catering to tourists in a city catering to tourists. Also, the grounds are really not visitor friendly. Lots of hills and uneven sidewalks, which are all stone pieces rather than solid concrete - pulling luggage is a chore. All the food is disturbingly overpriced and tastes terrible. After a long day of traveling we ordered ""room service"" of a personal pizza and hamburger and it was over $70. Overall, I would advise people to stay away and spend your money elsewhere.","January 12, 2019"
"I stayed at a very nice one bedroom unit in the Kalia Tower. Parking is convenient, although expensive at $45/day. Our balconies had a city view, which is beautiful at night. The tower has it's own pool in the 4th floor, which is a bit small. There are other pools, a lagoon and of course direct beach access available in the complex. We enjoyed our meals at Tropics restaurant- the breakfast menu is innovative, and the service was very, very good! Be prepared for lots of tourists- this is a touristy area of a tourist mecca, not a quiet romantic place. The Waikiki trolley stops nearby, which is an easy and inexpensive way to get to both Waikiki beach and Ala Moana shopping center. ","January 12, 2019"
"Resort is beautiful & has many good restaurants on site. Add beautiful beach area and Friday night fireworks on the beach and it’s relaxing. Take the walkway along the beach to other sites, shops and restaurants!!! Enormous complex!","January 12, 2019"
"First the positives ... great location and views from beach facing rooms. However, it feels like the place has gotten too big and is now desperately in need of a makeover of rooms and most importantly, service. Had a room in Tapa tower. Nice big 1 bedroom suite with great view. But place was in dire need of refurbishment. Stains on floor, dust on most fixtures, air conditioning stopped working and when it did was extremely noisy, not all water taps worked, bed and bedding OK but no where near what you would get for some price $500 per night) in most hotels.However, service was appalling. One nice person in whole week of being there (the guy at check in). Restaurants were too busy and most staff were generally rude, forgot orders, or simply ignored people. Even concierge and duty managers seemed mostly interested in simply making problems 'go away' by offering $20 rather than addressing anything. Many staff seemed uninterested and simply there to do a job rather than be helpful.End result was that after paying a huge amount of money, we left feeling like place was simply a huge machine (there seems to be thousands of guest at any one time) there to take your money and then move on to the next guest. If you could avoid interacting with staff or inhouse services and simply enjoy pools and location then this is a good place.","January 12, 2019"
"We stayed here for our honeymoon at the end of December 2018 to the beginning of January 2019. We had an oceanfront room on the 4th floor. It was very nice, clean, and we had a great view of the weekly Friday night fireworks. The hotel was not nearly as crowded as we anticipated, based on other reviews we read before our trip. Check-in and check-out were very easy. Parking is very expensive at the lot closest to the resort, but if you are military, you can get a discount at a parking lot near the Hale Koa resort. The Ali'i has its own pool, bar, and restaurant (not all of the other resorts have these). Everyone who we encountered as an employee was very attentive. There are also lots of boutiques and restaurants within a reasonable walking distance of the resort. We spent most of our trip walking, rather than driving. A few other amenities are that there is a heated toilet seat in the bathroom and there is AC (only goes down to 68 degrees). One thing that might be helpful to know (as we were not aware of this) is that if you want to use the lounge chairs and umbrellas on the beach, you have to rent them for a fee; they are not free to use. However, the pool lounge chairs are free to use as they cannot be reserved. There are robes and slippers in the bathroom closet, but they are very expensive to purchase for the quality. The laundry is also very expensive, so I would recommend not planning to do laundry on your trip.","January 11, 2019"
"We went to Waikiki for Christmas, New Year and my wife's 40th Birthday. On arrival around 8pm, we were dropped off at another part of the hotel complex. No person meeting us, directions, just left to find our own way to the main reception.Once checked in and found our way to the room, the junior suite was not what we expected having paid the extra for this room. The room is dated and need updating. We had a separate area with a fridge, coffee machine. No spoons to stir coffee, no knifes and forks etc.When it came to the cleaners, the did as little as possible. An example of this is that my little girl dropped on the floor some Lego (present for Christmas) and 2 days later I picked this up off the floor. The sinks were not cleaned as the wife ended up doing this herself. Very poor on the cleaning front.Location was good as just far enough away from the shops and restaurants in Waikiki main shopping area. The sign on the pool mad us laugh as it said that sun loungers are not to be reserved. If you don't return within 1 hour your items would be removed. This never happened.","January 10, 2019"
"Arrived on New Year’s Day to a hotel filled to capacity. We had booked an ocean view in Rainbow Tower, and ended up with a lagoon/ocean view with 2 balconies for the first 2 nights and then spent last 3 in ocean/diamond head view (my favorite). Donna was wonderful to work with—so cheerful and accommodating (as are most of not all staff at this hotel). Spent most of the time at the crowded beach as pool was super crowded and shaded most of the day. This property is simply beautiful—an oasis in the midst of a crowded city. Do miss the penguins, tropical birds, and beautiful floral displays and much prefer the older tropical decor rather than the muted drab colors, but I would never consider staying anywhere but here. A few minor glitches—with the worst being a non functioning elevator—but still a great property especially with Friday’s fireworks outside our door.","January 10, 2019"
"We love this resort. It does get crowded when there is a conference going on and the bars are full. The rooms have small refrigerators (most of them I believe) You don't need to leave the resort unless you want to. There are multiple ABC stores for food, tropical clothing, wine, liquor, gifts, etc. There are many small shops on the property. Things can get a bit expensive but welcome to Hawaii! This is the only place we have ever stayed in Waikiki.","January 10, 2019"
"We stayed here (in the Ali'i tower) the last few nights of our 2-week honeymoon trip. Room was beautiful and clean. Partial ocean view. We stayed at mostly Hilton properties around the islands, as this is our status loyalty. We absolutely won't ever return to Waikiki Beach though, and certainly not at this hell hole of a ""resort"". In a way, being in Waikiki is much worse than where i work in Times Square. I'm glad we only stopped here for 2 nights before flying home. We did not rent a car for this portion, because they wanted to charge around $50/night LOL!!! this place is for tourists.Hawaiian Village is notably the best hotel in Waikiki, which doesn't say much at all. The beach itself is narrow, filled with shells, can't be barefoot really, overcrowded in general, overrun with tourists, and the resort removes all the chairs before sunset!! Not pleasant at all to hang out. We didn't even go in the ocean on this leg of the trip because of how unpleasant their beachfront was. Does not even feel like a vacation. It baffles me that some people spend an entire vacation in waikiki, packed like a sardine in this resort. The pools were all COLD, but are open until long after sunset, but IF YOU DONT RETURN YOUR TOWELS BY 5PM THEY CHARGE YOUR ROOM. What the hell? this place is stingy and leaves a bad ""factory"" taste in my mouth. In the ""exclusive"" Ali'i tower pool, it was also ice cold and the hot tub was broken. On the second day, they brought a makeshift above-ground temporary hot tub and set it up. Within minutes of turning it on, 6-7 screaming children jumped in.... and didn't move for hours... then mid-afternoon the waitresses did last call at the Ali'i pool!! in the afternoon!! i asked why and she said when its not busy ""enough"" they all get sent home. This hotel is a good representation of Waikiki Beach at large -- TOTAL GARBAGE.If you are headed to Oahu specifically, i highly recommend you skip Waikiki Beach entirely, and the Hilton portfolio entirely, and stay at Disney's Aulani near Ko Olina.","January 9, 2019"
"I recently completed my second stay at the HHV in December 2018 as a Hilton Honors Diamond level status guest. While I didn't expect a corner suite upgrade, I did expect something better than a 7th floor room in the tired, worn out Kalia Tower with a view of a parking garage. At check-in I was also advised of the $10 per day Diamond guest credit for select F&B locations at the HHV. Once I arrived home I noticed I received NONE of the promised credits and had to take the time to call to get the applicable charges reversed - very disappointing! What's the point of brand loyalty if you don't receive notable benefits during an aspirational trip? You can do better HHV - you have for me in the past. Now for the positives - the Lanakai Juice outlet (excluded from the $10/day food credit benefit for Diamond guests) was awesome. A must stop everyday of my trip for their unique bows and smoothies. Not the cheapest but, hey, it's Hawaii right? The pools were well maintained and visually appealing with the one of the 4th floor of the Kalia Tower always being the least crowded. Associates were generally friendly and valet service was always timely.","January 9, 2019"
I took my 7 yo daughter for a quick vacation before the holidays ended. We spent 4 fabulous days at the resort with a room in the Rainbow tower with a spectacular view of both the city and the Pacific. Our days consisted of beach then pool and back again. Wonderful fireworks on Friday and New years eve. Found a few ways to keep food costs down (round table pizza and ABC market). Enjoyed excellent meals at all on property resteraunts. Met some neat families and felt totally relaxed throughout. Thank you Hilton for a very meaningful and memorable stay!,"January 8, 2019"
"We stayed here for our first trip out to Oahu and were not disappointed. The resort staff is extremely nice and helpful as well ensuring you have the best stay possible. We stayed in the Tapa Tower on the 16th floor with what they called a resort view. While facing a shorter resort tower, we were still able to see the ocean and watch as the sailboats went in and out as well as the surfers. The room was spacious with a balcony and it was easy to navigate from our tower to the beach. We spent most of our time at the beach instead of in the pools, but everything was very nicely maintained and clean. We went night snorkeling a couple of times with a dive light and were extremely surprised at the ability to walk right into the water from the resort and be swimming among some of the largest sea turtles we encountered. There was a lot to see and do, though some was quite expensive (you are paying for the ease of access), but just outside of the resort were more shops and prices went down quite a bit. I would recommend staying here for anyone that is looking for the whole complete Oahu package. It was an amazing experience and closely located to everything that we wanted to do. You do not have to go far to find something interesting or adventurous.","January 8, 2019"
"The HHV is absolutely huge, with people everywhere you go, any time of day. We stayed at the Alii Tower, which had its own checkin, making life definitely easier. We were offered an upgrade, which we accepted, and definitely enjoyed the ocean view. The room, while spacious, is in need of refurbishment, since the furniture is looking somewhat beat up. The bathroom is large and well appointed, but I sure could have used a clothesline in the tub to hang up wet bathing suits! We found the nightlife fun on one evening with a good band playing (loved the line, ""We're playing the music you listened to before you could afford to come to Hawaii!"") but very frustrating on another, with no seats and a large party grabbing every table and chair as soon as they became available. We ended up leaving. The beach is nice, but $50 to rent an umbrella and chair for a day? What in the world is the resort fee for then? If you like the idea of being constantly surrounded by thousands of your newest friends, you'll love the HHV. If you're looking for a more ""aloha"" vibe, you might need to look elsewhere. Having just come from several days on Maui, with a much more relaxed atmosphere, this was a bit jarring. I will say, all the staff we encountered during our 4 day stay were friendly and helpful, and we did enjoy our time on Oahu. I guess it depends on what you're looking for.","January 8, 2019"
"This hotel is in a great location and receives huge amounts guest traffic. The staff and hotel layout are simply not equipped to handle this amount of traffic. Be prepared to wait in long lines for check-in, and don’t expect much in the way of customer service.","January 8, 2019"
We stayed in the Rainbow Tower at Hilton Hawaiian village for seven days over Christmas. The hotel property is beautiful and is on a perfect spot on the beach. Our room was on the 19th floor. We had a beach view which was super nice. Our room was in desperate need of repairs. There were dents and scrapes in the walls. The tiles were chipped. The paint was in serious need of redoing etc. The bedding was ripped on the duvet cover on one of the beds. Our biggest complaint however would be that of the seven nights that we were there we didn’t have hot water for four of them. We were given a wide variety of reasons as to why we didn’t have it. Most people on the 19th floor didn’t have hot water. We were given a refund for our resort fees as compensation for not having hot water but other than that they weren’t overly helpful. The staff is friendly but the suggestions like showering in a different tower were not very feasible. We would have appreciated being moved to a new room with functioning water and no excuses as to what was wrong. We wish that we would have had a better experience as quite a lot of the rest of the hotel was quite lovely. The fireworks were awesome the pools were also very nice. We also enjoyed the movie rentals. ,"January 7, 2019"
We had a great stay here. We enjoyed the resort. Our room was great. Shout-out to Keith the bartender who took good care of us and mixes a good drink. The sunset views are spectacular. The amenities are ample. It is a huge facility.,"January 7, 2019"
"There are better hotels. No recognition of lifetime Diamond status. Room was old and small and was not offered WiFi. No help to find the room. No help with bags!Everyone stood around and watched. Shuttle took us to the very back of the hotel with no instructions to find the lobby. As a Hilton Diamond, I stay in many hotels over the last 30 years, this ranks at the bottom. DO NOT STAY HERE! Horrible service. I ","January 7, 2019"

"Stayed 12/30 until 1/4. First ever visit to Hawaii. With so many reviews, there's not much to be said that hasn't already been said. I'll try and keep it short and sweet and focus on just some key points. Overall, I think a 4-star rating is too high, but a 3-star rating is too low. I'd probably say this is more of a 3.5 to 3.75 property mainly because the extremely high luxury pricing doesn't necessarily mean luxury accommodations and amenities. Pros: - Only about 20-30 minutes from the airport- Property has everything you could possibly need. Like 3 ABC stores (sort of like convenience stores), multiple restaurants, bars, shops etc. If you don't ever want to leave the property, you don't have to. - Plenty of pools to choose from and most are good for kids (only one pool has slides, however)- An easy 5-10 minute walk to any of the pools, the lagoon, shopping, dining or the beach. - Very kid friendly when it comes to amenities, including surf lessons for example- Great location- Good dining options give you some variety if you're hesitant to leave the property. - You are given towel cards that you can exchange for beach/pool towels - no need to bring your own. Just make sure you return the towels to get your cards back for the next time.Cons: - Most of the pools are on the smaller and get overcrowded by mid-morning. - Crazy expensive for just about everything (And this is coming from someone that regularly visits NYC, LA, Chicago, etc.). If you want to save some money, take a short Uber out of property or walk along Kalakaua Ave (10-15 min walk to more shopping/dining/etc). - Rooms in the Tapa Tower and Grand Waikian were somewhat outdated and, to me, not worth the price of admission. I.e., luxury pricing but 3-star lodging. - Only one bar seems to be open late (Tapa Bar) and gets very crowded- No adults-only pool- There is no fun allowed in the pools. This is not a joke. You cannot throw the ball, ride on each other's shoulders, toss your kids, etc.The pool police will be on you like hawks. Tips: - Get down to the pool about 8 AM if you want to reserve some lounge chairs (they're first come, first serve). However, if you vacate them they will be taken within seconds. Beach chairs/umbrellas are rented.- Consider express checkout as you can be waiting 5-10 minutes along for an elevator between the hours of 9 AM and 12 PM on busy checkout days.- Uber is cheaper compared to Cabs for just about any destination. Cabs are readily available but I never waited more than 5 minutes for an Uber. Compared to others I talked to that took a cab I always saved about $5. Over half a dozen trips (not counting the airport) that really added up. - Different towers have different check out times. Check yours closely. - If you want to have fun in the water, go to the lagoon or the beach. Avoid the pool police.Bottom Line: - I came for a wedding and chose property based on that fact. If I were to come again for just myself, I would likely choose somewhere else simply to try and save some money. However, if money is of no concern, it's hard to go wrong with this property as it has everything you need.","January 7, 2019"
"Booked our family’s holiday trip six months in advance and we were very excited to get to Hawaii. Upon arrival, surprised to see bell men standing around and not offering to assist guests with bags. Okay, we’ll handle our luggage then. Get to front desk and the room we requested six months ago is not available. Clerk tells us to check back in a few days to see if something opens up because it’s Christmas and they are booked solid. Well, this was certainly a sign of what would come. Overall poor service and not consistent with the “Hawaiian hospitality” that everyone talks about. The only staff that went out of their way to be friendly was Housekeeping that would greet you each day with a “good morning”.So, after getting to our room carrying our luggage, we were completely disappointed with the condition of the room. Attached are pictures from the sofa bed where my children would have to sleep (because they gave us the wrong room) where you can clearly see disgusting stains on the cushions. We also had to request a roll away bed/cot (again, because they gave us the wrong room type) which took 4 calls to the front desk to finally arrive at 9:45pm. After two days on these uncomfortable options, our kids begged us to sleep on the king bed because the sofa bed and cot were terribly uncomfortable. The views from the balconies was breathtaking and it was wonderful to enjoy a cup of coffee each morning looking at the water, see pic. That is, until they started construction on the building fascade to be awoken to the sounds of concrete drilling and the annoying beeping of some mechanical lift.Elevators - terrible. Be prepared to wait 15 mins. Pool area - it is not at all closed to the public and we saw on several occasions, locals using the pool then walking out to their cars parked in the municipal lot next door. There is also nothing to prevent anyone from getting onto an elevator and walking on guest floors. Food -pizza spot was good. Lanpert’s was our daily coffee and ice cream spot. Overall, prices are outrageous, even when compared to New York City prices. But, that’s typical for Hawaii. Want to save a few bucks? Hit the ABCD store for beers/alcohol and light food and snacks. The one in the village is comparably prices with others in the area and it was very convenient.So, it’s time to go home. Let’s have some pizza before the long flight. Oh, where can we leave our luggage? Well, instead of the bellmen looking to assist, they point us to another building and tell us to leave our bags with their bellmen. As we walk in the pouring rain rolling our luggage, I can’t help but remember that no other place has treated us so poorly after spending so much money. Oh, this was a memorable trip - for all the wrong reasons. Do yourself a favor and consider another hotel.","January 7, 2019"
This was my 5th stay at HHV. Staying in the Rainbow Tower in the Ocean front room allows for an amazing view of Diamond Head. All of the staff at HHV go out the their way to make my wife and I feel welcome. There are some really excellent restaurants here. Tropics was great for me as well as Hau Tree Cantina. You can also enjoy the Hau Tree menu at the superpool. I really liked the veggie burger at tropics. We also had some great veg meals delivered via Doordash and Uber Eats. The location is the best part of Waikiki beach and it is very easy to walk around. Mahalo and have a great stay there. We will definitely be back.,"January 7, 2019"
"I am a Hilton Diamond member so I’m obviously a loyal customer. But you are not appreciated as a loyal member here, and the cost of everything is highly inflated. Be careful when booking ocean and resort view rooms. They aren’t as advertised!","January 6, 2019"
"The hotel and staff are amazing. We stayed in the rainbow tower for our honeymoon. It was amazing, we would love top stay here again. The beach is amazingly close and not very crowded compared to the other areas around Waikiki.","January 6, 2019"
"We stayed at the Hilton Resort at Waikiki. The room was fine with a beautiful view of the Pacific, though it was called a partial view. The restaurants were quite expensive though we found out all restaurants were quite expensive. The beach was nice and well kept. A big down side was the price for parking; something like $45 per day. The tower we stayed in was one of their ""resident"" towers or whatever they call them and since we weren't residents, the front desk in the building wouldn't/couldn't help us. We would have to go to the main desk in another building if we needed something. I don't smoke, but for those who do there is only one designated smoking area in the whole resort. Overall it was a good visit, but I expected more for the price.","January 6, 2019"
This is a great facility. Took over an hour to check in even though I had checked in online. They don’t have full online checkin here to get key stayed in Alii tower which is supposed to be best with concierge but they don’t know what they are doing. Hard to get a chair at the pool and they nickel and dime you. Overall there are much better hotels. ,"January 6, 2019"
"We hired a shuttle from the airport to this resort on 11/30/18. Upon arrival to this resort, the passengers were let off at the resort bus shuttle area. We received our luggage and there were no bellmen there. We requested one, and none came. We had to walk a ver, very long way to get to the reservation desk. We passed the bell stand near the checking area, and there was no shortage of bellmen just standing around. WoW!2nd. We had purchased tickets for the Luau before we left VA. We were schulded for the Luau after we got back from the cruise. When we arrived, and early, for the Luau it was not raining. When the staff member opened the doors, we were given a flower lei, and a rain poncho. I asked why the poncho? The answer because it was sprinkling. I asked are you going to still proceed with the show? The answer was yes. Really? We were seated and the rain came and went. Then a downpour. I questioned the Restaurant Manager, Catherine Caro as to why overhead covers/tarps were not put up prior, she claims they don't have the ability to do that and offered a refund. S T U P I D, P O O R, U N I N T E L L I G E N T. Everybody's food was ruined! DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. After 3 weeks, got a refund in the mail. DO NOT GO HERE FOR A LUAU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","January 6, 2019"
"From the moment we arrived, everything was wonderful. Check in was quick and once we got to our room, it was what we expected!. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower in a Marina facing room, and the view was stunning! The room itself was lovely. Pretty much every single person we spoke to was helpful and went out of their way to make our stay amazing.With two young kids, we chose the HHW mainly because of the pools! Quite simply, they were awesome! We spent a few hours every day in the pools, with the kids especially loving the one with the waterslides! All pools have plenty of lifeguards, which provides you with reassurance as a parent. On a couple of occasions we saw staff speaking to parents about needing to properly supervise their children. So they take safety seriously!Whilst food can be expensive at the HHW, we made use of the ABC Store on site, which provided a great range of cereals, fresh fruit and vegetables, sandwiches and other things parents and kids like to eat and drink! We also grabbed coffee from Starbucks (two onsite!) on a daily occasion! Can highly recommend the restaurants onsite as well, particularly the Pizza restaurant!All in all, we would definitely stay at the HHW again and highly recommend it for couples and families! I'm happy to answer any questions, so feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions.","January 6, 2019"
"Great location. Outrageous resort fees. Expensive food for location. Structural issues regarding the tower we stayed in were not obviously addressed. That said, you never have to leave the campus to enjoy a holiday; just take out a mortgage before you travel.","January 6, 2019"
"Stay within walking distance of Waikiki without being in the crowds. With its own lagoon, pools, beach at your doorstep. Restaurants and shopping- I would definitely stay here again! We were a family with 2 teenagers and had interconnecting rooms.","January 6, 2019"
We stayed at the HHV in december 2018 for 10 days and its a beautiful property. Given hotel is massive place is crowded all the time. We got our room upgraded to the rainbow tower with ocean views and great waikiki beach. One of the best views in waikiki. Room was good as well and nothing to complain about. We got room service everyday of our stay.However our happiness was turned upside down when hotel made a mistake with my credit card where they kept on charging the upgrade+resort fees everyday which topped my card. I found this out when I try to use my card at the cheese cake factory when transaction got declined. Spent almost 2 hours on the phone to my bank and the hotels finance department. However bank took two weeks to cancel the charges and refund my money where we have well and truly back home after our holiday. This ruined remainder of our holiday as each and everytime I had to pay international fees and currency fees since I didnt carry cash. And I ran out of my backup card as well.After realising the error HHV did compansate my fees and they gave me free meals coupons. Also Luau show after I asked for it. Front office Manager Vijay was very helpful along the way and he kept me in contact throughout this bungle. He went out of his way to help us enjoy our holiday. He gave me a call even after we returned home to check that all were ok. Very appreciative of this to him.,"January 5, 2019"
"Beautiful Resort. Brought back such memories for me since I had been here about 25 years before, too. Needless to say, it has been completely updated and renovated since that time! This trip was with my husband, and we had an awesome time. So many things to do and see. (Although we had heart failure at the $20+ hamburger!) You won't be disappointed if you stay here!","January 5, 2019"
It was a nice hotel. The staff were friendly and there was a lot to do however a lot of the activities filled up hours in advance and so we were actually unable to do much. The pools were nice and the beach was nice however a little overcrowded.,"January 5, 2019"
"I had a room in the diamond head tower, which is one of the older units. It was very nice. The rooms have been updated, and are very clean. There is an enormous variety of shops, pools, eateries, lounges, activities, and more. It has a lagoon that offers lessons on surfing and paddle boarding. The beach is ala moana, and I think it is better than waikiki. Beautiful property!","January 5, 2019"
"We loved everything about the corner-room, with an awesome view! Hotel staff is and was, all-around amazing! From the Friday night fireworks, bucket-list sunsets and sunrises, food, drinks, beach(es), pool(s), relaxing, shopping, and swimming. Everything you need, is on site, or a phone call away. Many activities, to choose from, for all ages, on and off site!!! Live music, every night. There’s even a Xerox office/shipping store, with a US Post office! *My only negative experience, was the pools and hot tubs, outside of the Ali’i tower, are way too crowded.!. The Ali’i tower, has wrist bands, to make the pool exclusive, for tower guests only. There should be special wristbands, for all the pools, to keep them exclusive for paying guests. I watched many locals, taking advantage, using the cove, and open pools. ","January 4, 2019"
"Check in was super easy. They are under relatively new management, and the management is excellent. Every employee we encountered had the true aloha spirit!  When checking in, whether you are Hilton Honors or not, there is an assistant, Nichole, with an iPad helping everyone in line and the check in goes much faster. Nichole needs to continue to upper management, she is excellent! Our check in was super smooth, received an upgrade as Hilton Diamond. The restaurants and happy hours at the HHW are the best in Waikiki. The views at the Tropics Bar and Grill are superb, food is delicious, and service is friendly. Great happy hour. We also tried several other restaurants along Waikiki and loved the view from the Tropics Bar and Grill the best! Rainbow tower corner rooms have amazing views. You can see the sunrise and sunset with two balconies. Must watch the Friday fireworks at 7:45 just outside the Hilton on the beach. We've stayed here at least 5 times for weeklong vacations and always return to the rainbow tower. They also have a new elevator service that gets you to your room quickly! Pools are fun and plentiful, there is a waterslide near the Grand Vacation and overlooking the lagoon. You can use this pool while staying at the HHW. This hotel is in a great location at the end of Waikiki, but easily walkable to all of the shopping, dining and beaches along Waikiki. We actually walked along the beach with our toes in the water for a couple of dinners. Be careful, watch for the small shiny circular jellyfish late at night on the beach. They get washed up and then back to the sea. We saw them one night in plentiful as we walked back from dinner, so amazing. This hotel is centrally located, a short 20 minute drive to Pearl Harbor, beautiful hiking (Moana Falls or the Lighthouse Hike), and the best poke ever! Foodland has really delicious poke, just stop on the way from the airport, grab some sundries, check in to the HHW and you're ready to relax! Also try Tamuras for really fresh poke.Snorkeling right in front of the HHV is pretty good. I'm comparing to the Caribbean and Bora Bora. It rates fairly good for ease and convenience. What I'm glad I brought:Snorkel and mask (fins would be nice) we snorkeled every day at the hotelextra sunscreencollapsable cooler and cooziesContigo for drink on the beachreuasble shopping baganti itch cream (yes you may need it!)What I wish I had brought:a floaty or raft for the beachWhat I didn't need:high heelsOverall, it's a big hotel, beautiful gardens, we love it and will return again and again!","January 3, 2019"
"First time away from home for the holidays, but could not have asked for a better trip. The hotel was wonderful, situated on Waikike beach. Breakfast at the Tropic bar looking out on the beach delightful. Had plenty of things to do for children and adults 5 pools, paddle boarding, etc on beach. Diamond head climb to top, view breathtaking, Pearl Harbor a must, dining on and off the property wonderful. Uncles fish market a must. Menu has something for everyone, the international marketplace has a number of restaurants. The 2 we went to were terrific. Also it is a great shopping mall. I have been to Hawaii 5 times (Honolulu and 4 of the other islands. It is my favorite place to vacation and we always stay at a Hilton.","January 3, 2019"
"The check-in was the longest, most confusing and convoluted system I’ve ever experienced. Then we were berated by the hostess for standing in the wrong place, making us feel like idiots. This was the rudest woman and worst experience of our 14 days in Hawaii.","January 3, 2019"
"It had been 6 years since our last stay at this resort, there have been a few changes since our last visit, but the resort is just as good as ever. There are lots of food and shopping options right on the resort (and even more within a few blocks). We had an oceanfront room in the Rainbow Tower, wonderful views of Diamond Head and the beach. We also had great views of the Fireworks on Friday night, we didn't even have to leave our room! Room was clean and comfortable, staff was friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit!","January 3, 2019"
"We would highly recommend this resort to anyone planning a winter getaway. It has everything you need to do in a single location. Lots of activities, great bars and pools, great staff that work to make your stay a fantastic family memory!","January 2, 2019"
"We stayed here for a week of our honeymoon before our cruise to the different islands. The hotel was good, big rooms and access to tv with films you can rent! The rooms had everything you needed like a fridge, iron, hair dryer and kettle. The restaurants on the resort are nice but can be quite expensive! Don’t be afraid to go out and experience other restaurants we had great ribs at Tony ramones and lovely pizza at California Pizza kitchen! Pools don’t get a lot of sun due to the big buildings but just go to the beach.A bit of advice would be to try and book your excursions by yourself! For example the Pearl Harbor one is a rip off! Just get the bus there for $5 each and it’s free to get in. The Hilton try and charge you $45 each and it’s basically an expensive taxi!! Also we queued up for over an hour at the activity desk (because the guy was trying to flirt with every female going) to be told it’s full- he didn’t call anyone or check the computer just said they’re always full. So we called them ourselves and we booked on for the next day as they did have space, this was at Kualoa Ranch which we highly recommend! Overall a nice stay and in a good location, try and check out their free show and fireworks too","January 2, 2019"
"Ridiculously overpriced for what you actually get. Parking your rental car is an absolute rip off. $43 per day for a registered guest plus an additional $40 per day ""resort"" fee is complete robbery for what you actually get. The grounds are immaculate for certain, but if you want a chair or umbrella for the beach..additional $100 felt like a third world country getting pinched for absolutely everything when the exorbitant amounts we were already paying, it should have been included. Loved Hawai'i would not recommend staying at this resort unless you intend to never leave it. ","January 2, 2019"
"We stayed in this hotel from December 17th-23rd and we had a great experience. This was a family trip with all ages, starting from 1 year old to 83 year old. This hotel accommodated us with everything we needed. We needed a wheelchair which we rented from a local rental area and it was so easy to use in the hotel. We had 2 rooms next to each other with accessible door in between. The rooms had fantastic views and they were very clean and roomy. The resort had all the fun stuff for the kids to play with and enjoy themselves. We ate most of the time inside the resort which was very convenient and easy and not too long wait. On the last day, we needed to get a late check out and the manager, Mr. Kevin, was kind enough to make that happen for us. I highly recommend this hotel for family trips. Thank you to all the personnel at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki for making our family trip special.","January 2, 2019"
"My family of four has stayed at this Hilton 3X in the last 10 years, and it won't be our last. We last stayed in April, 2018. We are Hilton Diamond members and were allowed to pick our room ahead of time, which we did on the app as they had upgraded us from a resort view to an ocean view in the Rainbow Tower. Check in was then very easy and quick. We had previously stayed in Kalia tower and Tapa tower, and when we go back I'll hope again for Rainbow Tower since it was so much closer to the beach and pools. The rooms in Kalia are newer and larger, but it is so far away from the beach that there is definitely more walking involved in getting around. Rainbow Tower rooms are smaller and older but the location definitely makes up for it. We ate both on resort and off resort and found plenty of options that were great, allergy and gluten friendly, and staff that were helpful. There are 2 ABC stores within the resort and they sell anything you need from sunscreen to cereal and my husband, who is gluten free, was able to find plenty of snacks there. We spent a lot of time at the heated Paradise pool and rented aqua bikes and SUPs in the lagoon. No need to rent a car as there are plenty of shuttles from the airport, and tons of Uber options to get around Waikiki. Next door on Ala Moana Blvd is a car rental company that you can rent one day rentals if you want to get out of Waikiki. The Starbucks on site were welcomed, and we appreciated having the 2 locations at the resort to get our early morning fix, however they don't open until 5am so if you're up super early because you're still on East Coast time, you may have to wait and join the line at the door at 5am. The beach is beautiful and the view of Diamond Head from the room balcony can't be beat. We love this resort and will be back, thanks for filling our stay with Aloha!","January 2, 2019"
"This is my second time here. First time, experience was great. This time, not so much. There are several different towers and we happened to stay at the Tapa Tower. The first room we stayed at was on the 3rd floor. We had a view of the roof of some structure with trash everywhere and pigeons. It was disgusting. Luckily we were able to get a different room after we showed the front desk a picture of our view. Every time someone in our hall shut the door We could hear loud thud, and we could hear the conversations. Not a good thing when you’re trying to sleep. The food was overpriced, which is to be expected at any resort. Luckily there are lots of dining options outside the resort with much better food. The place was packed and during our whole stay we were not able to find lounge chairs at any of the pools. Except for housekeeping and the guy who helped us get a new room, there wasn’t much Aloha spirit from the staff. They generally seemed annoyed. I’m sure it’s not easy trying to help soooo many people. I would probably not come back here. I would probably do more research and find a better place next time.","January 2, 2019"
"We stayed on 32nd floor and our sea view was spectacular, worth every penny. Large and clean room. The only thing that we find needing improvement are some services eg. hotel umbrella(for 5 stars hotel it should have umbrella for guest to borrow instead of having to buy one), also unlike hotel in Asia, we had to ask for amenities (toothbrushes, slippers...). Having said that there are few convenience stores throughout the hotel","January 1, 2019"
"If you are looking for a relaxing Waikiki vacation then look elsewhere than the Hilton Hawaiian Village.Rooms: We had a high floor ocean view room with a great view of Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. However, the experience was undermined by the usage of DOUBLE beds. My family consists of husband, wife, and two pre-teens. We are average sized people and were uncomfortable, with no room to spare in the tiny beds- Resulting in horrible nights sleep. After a couple of days of this, we requested a “cot”, which Hilton initially tried to charge us $75/night. At one point, we contemplated buying sleeping bags to sleep on the floor. Room servicing seemed lacking as well- After a long day of sightseeing, we returned to find the beds were made with no sheets. Another negative was that a day from our checkin, we received an email from Hilton to “pick our room”. When we accessed the room selection webpage, only ONE room was available- No choice at all to make. Plus it was a handicapped accessible room. No one in our party is handicapped. When we called Hilton, they told us this was the only ocean view room left, despite the fact we booked nearly a year in advance. Upgrade was possible for $250 per night.The Beach: The section of beach Hilton Hawaiian Village uses is devoid of any waves at all. Experience is that of a giant lukewarm bathtub. Beach was crowded as well. Better sections of Waikiki Beach with wave action exist farther towards Diamond Head. Pools: Pools were decent but crowded. The Lagoon: Similar to the beach area. A murky pond with what looked like floating saliva floating on the surface.The check-in process: Chaotic and unorganized. We arrived at 10:30 am the day of our checkin and were told our room wouldn’t be ready till 3:00 pm. So we had to kill time till 3:00 pm with several carry on suitcases in tow. Upon our return at 3:00 pm to checkin, despite earlier claims that we could “go directly to our room and get in with an electronic key”, we had to wait in a long line a second time to checkin again. Just an idea, but maybe a separate line for people whose rooms are ready! At this point we were asked for some checkin form (with some checkin number), which no one told us about and we then we rerouted to another line where we were berated for not knowing the “process”.Parking: Parking is expensive as expected at Waikiki. We started valet parking our car at Hilton Hawaiian Village the second day because the self park is a pain and relatively speaking not much more than self park. What Hilton didn’t tell us is that from day one they were charging us for self park (which we only used ONCE) AND valet parking! We were told we had to cancel the self park daily- Every day we had to tell Hilton we weren’t self parking, otherwise they’d continue to charge us for self parking and valet parking. The Bottom Line: The Hilton Hawaiian Village is not for those seeking a relaxing Waikiki vacation. It’s noisy and crowded and there are better options closer towards Diamond Head. ","January 1, 2019"
Our family thoroughly enjoyed our three nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki. The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas which added to our celebration of the holidays. Tropics had the best gluten free breakfasts and lunches ever! ,"January 1, 2019"
"We stayed at the HHV recently and had an awesome time. There is a lot to love about this place. Tons of options for food, so much to do on the property and close by with endless activities to entertain the children. Well worth a visit, just be sure to bring your wallet. The prices to add up pretty fast for the family. Luckily the Hale Koa is right next door with plenty of affordable options for food and drink. If your looking to save a couple of $$ on lunch/dinner or some drinks check it out.","December 31, 2018"
"from the start they seem to not care,didn't get anything we requested and their get it right promise doesn't fix it. nothing is included in the rate,beach chairs and umbrella are $70 for the day.elevator system in rainbow two is a joke.","December 31, 2018"
"Booked 5 nights ocean view rainbow tower.I requested a walk in shower and paid in full 12 months ahead. When we arrived they did not have room with ocean view plus no shower. When i insisted they give me the room i paid for,they said if i pay extra $200 us extra a day they will give a better room. Told them i want my money back and they called the manager. I told him we have stayed at hilton,s around the world and never had such bad service. We were prepared to walk away .in the end the manager gave us a a suite at no extra charge.buy the way this resort fee cost $50 a day.","December 31, 2018"
"Rooms ac has a rattle that they can not fix. The solution..... to freaking bad you don’t have any options but to stay in this room and deal with it. We’ve had maintenance up 4 times in about 36 hours. They offered us a free breakfast and / or 100 room credit. Total insult.The property is poorly maintained, maintenance has no idea what they are doing. This is to be our honeymoon and it’s one of the worst experiences.Tomoko Scott is the manager I dealt with. She could not be less helpful. Waste of time. I have used Marriott in the past and been disappointed so I wanted to try Hilton. Just as disappointing. I will never stay here again and be sure to tell everyone I know to stay far far away from here.To top it off we tried to have a nice dinner at Bali... They forgot our appetizer. As an ‘ opps’ they brought us gross soup. The app finally came but it was wrong and no one came to check on us so we just ate it because it would be another 30-45 minutes. This place is awful all the way around. I just want to go home.","December 31, 2018"
"Nice place for a family vacation, walking distance to the strip and a lot of other locations. The hotel is kid friendly and offers different things to do. Wish SOME of the staff were friendlier. The person who cleaned our room was awesome. But some staff ppl need a class on hospitality.","December 31, 2018"
"Big resort, many places to eat, the lagoon was wonderful, nice firework every friday, friendly and helpful employees, resort fee is to much, nice rooms, the view from alii tower is wonderful, well-kept resort","December 30, 2018"
Nice hotel close to the beach and shops. Staff are excellent and very helpful. WiFi is not great keeps going in and out. Perhaps they need to upgrade the system. Pool is small. Buffet breakfast is okay but crowded and often not enough dishes. Rose went above and beyond her service duty we enjoyed meeting her. ,"December 30, 2018"
This is a great property that has something to do for everyone. The stores are nice and the view from the beach is fabulous! Centrally located so you can walk to the fabulous shops and restaurants if you want to leave the property ,"December 29, 2018"
"Excellent hotel, very clean, friendly staff and great location. It’s a beach front property, minutes away from airport and shopping area. Great hotel for family, large rooms and were clean, food was great. #happyhour. Only wish it was all inclusive,","December 28, 2018"
"I'm more of a funky or classic or boutique hotel kind of traveler. I'm not inclined to do the mega resort sort of thing. Too many people and children in the pool, on the beach and just sort of milling about.That being said I must confess that I enjoyed my stay at HHV. We were moving from a more centrally located hotel to the Hilton. After checking out of our previous hotel we went to check in here at about noon. We expected to have to wait for a room and had planned on hanging poolside for a few hours. We arrived to find a friendly staff member directing traffic to check-in and she quickly got us to a desk for HHonors members where our reservation was pulled up quickly and accurately. We were offered a choice of rooms and opted for the Rainbow Tower because it is such an icon and is celebrating 50 years. We got an absolutely spectacular room on the 17th floor, oceanside beachfront with two balconies and it was way cool.From arrival to room took no more than 15 minutes and was trouble free.We went exploring and the largest pools are indeed crowded with kids and families. There are a couple of other pools that are a bit off the radar and are much quieter and adult friendly. Now that we'd found our pools we checked out the Hau Tree bar and had very friendly and prompt service from the bar staff. We enjoyed a couple of the ""drink of the day"" specials and had a nice time exploring the property.This place has everything you need, you'd never have to leave at all. I'm a wanderer and like to explore so I was kind of turned off by this. Nothing wrong with it, just not my style.We spent a week ( I truthfully didn't think I'd last that long) enjoying the property and fulfilled my wanderlust by using it as a very comfortable base camp. We enjoyed the bars and restaurants when we felt like doing nothing and staying on property.Housekeeping was above par, staff was always friendly and accomodating and check-out was a breeze and charges were accurate.Has it changed my mind and made me a ""Resort"" convert? No, but I didn't mind it a bit.","December 28, 2018"
"So glad we didn’t stay anywhere else. This is the perfect place for families and a wonderful beach. Highly recommend! We enjoyed in oceanview room in the Kalia tower, which was a short walk to the beach, but far enough away that it was quiet at night. Be sure to enjoy the starlight luau at the resort - you will not be disappointed!","December 28, 2018"
"Its a village as the name says with many Hilton towers and ample enough restaurants and shopping inside the village itself.They have 3-4 pools and if you have kids then they are to spend all time in the pool.Hotel staff cleans the room every day while we enjoy the sea.Every tower lobby has a Starbucks if you are a coffee lover.Cons: Room doesn't have Microwave making your stay difficult with small kids, but many breakfasts serving restaurants down the village.Waikiki beach is an overrated utter waste for body surfing as the bottom is either rocks or corals.","December 28, 2018"
"We are half way into our winter vacation in Hawaii. We are owners at the Grand Waikikian but we typically rent out our Christmas week to friends and always stay at the fabulous Ali Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It has been a great vacation but the Ali tower has lost its lustre and differentiation from the other towers on the property. We like to be pampered while on vacation and have no problem paying extra for great service. Ali Tower is a huge disappointment this year especially on the pool deck. This year the Moto of the staff is “less is more”. Outside of one female attendant who was fabulous, we have yet to find anyone that really cares or wants to deliver excellent service. The front desk staff are attentive and helpful. As a gold member, the free breakfast is beyond pathetic. We were told to go to Starbucks which we did and they were sold out on the most basic items like a bagel. We have great friends who always vacation with us who decided to stay elsewhere and are very happy with their accommodations, price and service. The Ali staff need to start thinking more about differentiation. The fruit basket at the front desk is gone. A simple gesture of offering fresh coffee would be great. The rooms are starting to look dated as well. The HHV is still a great property but paying extra to stay in the Ali tower is now a questionable decision.","December 27, 2018"
"I would have a difficult time finding anything to complain about during our stay.. The Check In was quick and efficient. The pools and grounds were in meticulous shape. Service in all areas was excellent. All personnel was friendly and willing to answer any questions . Tried a couple of the restaurants on the property which I found to be extremely expensive but I guess prices were in line in a tourist area. However, a nearby restaurant at another hotel by the name of Cinnamin's was an excellent value and the food was delicious. Check this place out . You will not regret it. One complaint I do have is the forty dollar a day Resort Fee which I had not anticipated . Maybe I didn't read the fine print but I find the charge a little outrageous. Pools are usually packed by noon so get there early a stake your claim by one of the many pools are you will be left holding the beach towel. The beach, although one of the most famous in the world is nothing special. I've been to better beaches but it is clean and well maintained for a man made beach. Plenty of room for all. There is a lagoon nearby which is pretty interesting . If you are looking for cheap food, good luck. There is a Food Truck by the lagoon. If you like four coconut shrimp and a whole lot of hard fries. for about thirteen bucks, you might like it. There is a Dairy Queen by the lagoon. Prices are pretty high there too. Best bet if you are budget conscious and like quality food is Cinnamin:sat a nearby hotel. I Hop isn't bad either. Aside from the expensive food and the Resort Fees, I've got to say this place is top notch. It's obvious there is a culture of service here because you will find excellence from the Front Desk to Housekeeping. No wonder this hotel was a favorite of Elvis and the only hotel he would stay in on his many trips to the island. It is simply the best place to stay in Honolulu.","December 26, 2018"
"We disembarked from the Pride of America 7 day cruise on Saturday and were not leaving until Sunday evening so booked 2 rooms at this hotel. Check in took quite some time because of how busy they were. Grounds were pretty but the pools were packed so we headed to the shallow ocean pool. It was too cold to get into, though. So we found the hot tub! The shopping was awesome here for any wallet size. The location was great and our Concierge, Dean was wonderful. Make sure you sign up for the concierge by text. That made the older room and over populated pools almost worth it. Dean text us when our room was ready...gave us advice on a couple of questions we had and helped us with extended check out on Sunday. He was witty, helpful and a great perk! The room was older and was oddly set up with 3 double beds against one wall which we jokingly called it the Moe, Larry, and Curly room. It had a huge double 4 piece bathroom and large sitting area and desk. It was a great size for our family of 5. I was shocked at the price for this room for one night which was around $700 including all of the resort fees and taxes. yikes! Yes its beachfront, yes, its convenient, but our stay at the Laylow was just as great and it was one block off the beach but the room was nicer. Just saying! We had a car so we can get to the shopping so not sure this was worth it, but my family chose the lodgings and we were along for the ride so who am I to complain? If it were on my dime, though, I would have gone back to the Laylow.","December 25, 2018"
"Just returned home from my family vacation in Hawaii which I really enjoyed but this last 3 nights of hotel stay which we had planned as “the best for the last” was honestly below our expectations. In fact, I felt so disappointed with my stay that I decided to leave a review here. Summary: Pros: good location, good beach views, great fireworks on Friday nights, really has the extensiveness of a villageCons: mediocre to subpar service, inadequate facilities, old and dusty room, expensive and questionable resort fees, simply too many guests under their management in one resortSome personal examples:For starters, there is always high traffic volume into and out of the main lobby of the resort starting from the entrance of the resort. So despite the good location of the resort, it always takes us a while to get to somewhere even nearby by car. Poor service:At the main lobby, there are many different types of check-in counters which is mildly confusing for first time visitors. And despite the numerous counters present, there was always still a queue. In fact, our check-in process was slow too. While our check-in staff was friendly and welcoming, he told us that he could not understand our booking because it was done via a third party website and he had to confirm our booking with us multiple times and even went to ask other staff for assistance. Finally when the check-in was completed, he was the one who suggested adding a rollaway bed to our room for our convenience which we gladly agreed upon (note: he did not mention any additional charges for the bed & confirmed he will get the bed up for us).((Also, there was a separate bell service counter but no staff said anything about it and we brought our own luggage to our room, which I assumed is because our rainbow tower is nearby.))After waiting for an hour or two in our room after our check-in, no rollaway bed was delivered. Upon going down and visiting the check-in counters again, we learnt that a rollaway bed costs an extra USD75 per night and despite explaining our situation (we needed the bed not for extra people in the room but because I was traveling with my parents and there was only 1 king sized bed & there were no more similar rooms with 2 double beds instead), the staff simply reiterated the price of the rollaway bed per night. Needless to say, we were confused and annoyed as to why our previous check-in staff did not mention the cost of the bed to us ($75 per night for a rollaway bed is ridiculous given the prices of their rooms and the fact that some hotels offer free rollaway beds) and why he did not follow up on his promise to us and left us hanging. Moving on, there was a welcome card in the room that read that 1) we can collect a free welcome gift from the hotel and 2) we should make good use of our resort passport. Though we did not expect anything big for the welcome gift, we were definitely disappointed to have our hopes raised only to go down to the concierge to find out that the free gift was a tiny sample packet of Lion coffee. Even worse, we had to undergo stringent background checks (name, room number, how many nights we were staying etc) before we got the coffee packet, even when we brought the welcome card down to the concierge as proof. Also, upon inquiring about the resort passport (a booklet containing various resort retail and service discounts) as stated on the welcome card, we finally received it, and it was obvious that the concierge staff was shocked to learn that we did not have it before (“you guys don’t have this?”). So I think this is another thing that our check-in staff missed. Inadequate facilities:As for our room, it is spacious and offers a good view of the beach, but it is undeniably old and the PS3 and TV set were rather dusty. The thermostat could go down to 68 or 69 degrees only. More disappointingly, the room lacked a kettle and there was no complementary water in the mini fridge unlike most hotels so basically we had no water & had to resort to using the (also dusty) coffee machine to boil water.As for resort facilities, despite having 7 towers, only 2 towers have a gym, and one is exclusive to only its own tower guests, while the other gym is tucked away in the Kalia tower which is quite far for most guests. In addition, resort fees of USD40 per night was also something that ruined the experience for us. We had actually learnt of this fee beforehand, but what disappointed us is the little amount of actual benefit in this fee and the blatant amount of advertisement disguised as benefits. In fact, our check-in staff repeatedly told us to read the list of resort fee benefits so that we can enjoy them, but in all honesty, out of 3 columns of bullet points, the only things that we personally can enjoy without paying for more were the dvd rental, room wifi (which I thought should be covered in room fees) and daily lessons such as yoga and taichi. The others were mostly “exclusive resort member discounts”.Throughout our entire stay, we felt that the staffs were responsive when approached, but most were not warm. In fact, I felt that even some of my Uber drivers were much friendlier and warmer than the hotel staff. In its defence, the resort was probably more packed than usual due to the holiday season, but I truly felt that there were too many guests in the resort for them to take care of each and every single one of us, and we were unlucky. All in all, this stay was not worth the steep price in my opinion and I would not choose to stay here again.","December 25, 2018"
"We stayed at the Grand Waikikian for 5 days in December 2018. During that time we tended to hang out at the Tapa Pool because the rest of the resort was so crowded. There was a nice, large bathroom not far from the Tapa Pool. It was also popular with employees, as it was right next to their Human Resources office. Unfortunately, there were 17 food and beverage employees who pooped and didn’t wash their hands before returning to work during the 5 days. In fact, only 5 of 22 employees in food and beverage who pooped washed their hands before returning to work. At first, I wasn’t paying attention. But after I kept seeing employees poop and not wash their hands, I started counting. I even made note of their names and called guest services. Literally I was told that this is normal in Hawaii and that people don’t wash their hands after using the restroom. I guess there’s no health code for food service employees in Hawaii? No wonder so many people had digestive issues after eating at the hotel!","December 24, 2018"
"So we stayed in the Tapa Tower and it most certainly isn't what we thought we were paying for when we upgraded to an extra $35 USD per day for 10 days for an Ocean view room. The room must have had the original carpet, shower, tiles, wall paper, furniture etcThere was no jug for boiling water, just a Kmart coffee machine which Hilton didn't provide pods for!The bathroom was old and the plug got stuck on the first hour we were there.No cutlery was provided ( no idea why??). Only after ordering room service were we given cutlery. To charge an extra $40 USD fee per day (This ISN'T mentioned when purchasing rooms off the internet so BE AWARE) to cover costs like ""free wifi"", pool towels, dvd hire etc was like a slap in the face honestly.The restaurants and shops- basically purchasing anything was expensive and exorbitant on site. Food is nothing special at all. Parking was $40 per night!! Everything had a hidden expense and tipping was incredibly high.Pros were – ABC stores (saving Grace)/ Ice-cream shop / the pools and location right next to the Ocean. Beautiful grounds and fun for families and kids. The Hilton certainly create a world unto its own but it comes at a huge expense. It will be the last time staying here, costs are just too much for it's worth.","December 23, 2018"
"We stayed in the Tapa Tower on the last night of our vacation before flying back to the mainland. It was super disappointing. The beds were full size instead of queen and the room was in desperate need of a remodel. The thermostat only went down to 68 and we usually sleep with it colder in a hotel room. The beach access was phenomenal, but the rest of the hotel was below average. Also, it was super hard to find the Uber pick up place at 4:30 am and nobody to help!!I would only stay here again with a convention, but not on a family vacation. ","December 23, 2018"
"Great Family Stay for our family of 5. The hotel had something for each of our kids to enjoy (aged 4, 10 and 13). The range of Pools, lagoon and activities kept them busy. The location was excellent and would highly recommend.","December 23, 2018"
"We stayed in the Tapa tower (one of many that make up this hotel complex) and at least this poor tower is in need of a makeover. The room literally was held together by masking tape around the door frame (T1346) or simply has the strangest layout imaginable (T1345) and a floor that wasn’t level, scary for the 13th floor! The elevator areas are barren of furniture or artwork, really looks old and tired. Anyway, we stayed for 2 days prior to our cruise and couldn’t believe the amount of mayhem that was always present in the lobby area. This hotel has just too many rooms to manage in an orderly fashion. Also beach umbrellas and lounges are available to rent at way too high prices (family of 4 would have been well in excess of $100). Breakfast buffet was $40 a person, ala-cart perhaps could save you a few bucks a person. Overall we were not impressed and wouldn’t stay here again. ","December 23, 2018"
We were staying in the area at a different hotel... But we extended our stay and the place we were staying at unfortunately was booked... Made a call to Hilton and immediately got a room. We were very happy to stay. Our room was beautiful and perfect! And we could basically walk out the hotel and go right out to pools and beach. So many shops and food options which was perfect so you don't have to leave property.. which by the way is quite large with several hotel building and shopping center. It's a place we enjoyed and will go back,"December 22, 2018"
The room was clean the beds were horrible... couldn’t sleep even though we paid for a room upgrade. There was a lot of noise in the hallway after midnight the air conditioning system would not work properly. ,"December 20, 2018"
"Stayed here for our honeymoon. The resort itself is beautiful. The property boasts a large number of shops and restaurants so essentially it is one big mall. Although located on the beach, the location is not central but just convenient enough that you can walk or take an Uber to Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Mall. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower. I will say that the room we stayed in seemed a little run down and needs some updating. Other than that it was a pleasant experience overall.","December 20, 2018"
"Service is pretty good rooms are clean however there outdated and ran down, paint was coming off the walls. For what u pay in the ali tower its just a waste of money really the place needs some money spent on it. ","December 20, 2018"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a top notch resort hotel. Grounds, rooms, restaurants, shopping--all great. But I was there from 7/29 though 8/2 and it was so horribly crowded I would never return in the summer. It was difficult to get lounge chairs for the pool. The restaurants were too busy at meal times. Everything was over priced. It was very busy.","December 19, 2018"
"Don't get me wrong, I love the Hilton Worldwide Collection of Resorts and Hotels but a shining gem inlaid deeply into the foundation of the iconic Hilton Hawaiian Village is the Xerox Business Center. Going mostly unnoticed inside this massive complex the Xerox Business Center is an energetic yet personable part of the Hilton for the last 20 years. Inside is a United States Postal Service and FedEx all together in one place for your convenience. The doors open daily at 6 am and close at 10 pm most nights. When you open the doors a gust of frigidly inviting air quickly revitalizes and welcomes you to Xerox. Upon walking into the suite you are then given a warm welcome from an exceptionally wonderful person, who I have fondly named ""the heart of Xerox"" Operations Manager, Monique Jansky. Her personality and devotion to Xerox and the Hilton is apparent with her attention to detail and the way she makes EVERYONE feel special and that you belong there...after all, isn't that what we all want? It is because of Monique I based my decision to write this review. Back to the services: One can easily and quickly print boarding passes with a few clicks of the mouse and a credit card or nestle into one of the many mini-cyber suites and read your daily email while chatting with a friend on the other side of the world boasting of your many adventures you've been having in Pineapple Land. If you are computer illiterate, no worries as any of the courteous staff make themselves available to assist you at a moments notice with ANYTHING you may need, even if you are not a guest. A perk that goes overlooked by many is that registered guests of the hotel can enjoy 24 hour unrestricted access to this facility, which believe me has saved me many a night. The internet speed is exceptional and the web security is what one would expect from a Fortune 500 Company such as Xerox.","December 19, 2018"
"I have rated this hotel ‘average’ for a number of reasons. Namely there was no hot water, we were staying one night and had a very early departure and so had to have cold showers the night before leaving. Apparently there were issues with the boiler room so I imagine all guests had the same problem.It was also disappointing that the pool and spa closed at 7pm and 8pm. Considering check in is 3pm, this doesn’t give a lot of time to kick back and relax in the pool by the time you settle in and enjoy the beach. During our stay in Hawaii I would say this was our least favourite place and upon return will probably not return here.On the bright side, we stayed in the rainbow tower and this was a very spacious suite with beautiful views and comfortable bed. ","December 19, 2018"
"This was my 3rd stay at HHV and 2nd time in the Rainbow Tower. Last minute birthday 3 night/4 day weekend from DC using miles to get there! I have to say the Rainbow Tower really makes a huge part of the experience. Ocean front room and amazing view of Diamond Head. That lanai becomes a destination in itself. I was very impressed even more this time with the friendliness, professionalism and caring attitude of the staff. As a solo traveler I had many positive interactions with restaurant staff, bartenders, front desk staff, towel stand, pool servers, and they went out the their way to make me feel welcome. I have some dietary restrictions of vegetarian and gluten free, and Tropics was great for me as well as Hau Tree Cantina. You can also enjoy the Hau Tree menu at the superpool when they come around to take your order. I love the veg burger at tropics and they made my fries gluten free too. Also had a couple of great veg meals delivered via Doordash and Uber Eats. Just a tip...Uber and Lyft drop off/pick up point is in back of Diamond Head Tower...not the main front desk area. I found that the staff went out of their way to treat me as a valued guest and that was great to see. The location goes without saying! Best part of waikiki beach and easy to walk around. Can't wait to go back! Mahalo for a great stay.","December 18, 2018"
"This was our 4th time at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and like the other trips here, we had a wonderful experience starting with our check in. We were treated with exceptional customer service by the desk clerks. Our room was comfortable. I would recommend the Village to anyone wishing to relax and enjoy Waikiki.","December 18, 2018"
"I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for six nights in December 2018. Having just stayed at another Hilton property the week prior, the Hilton Hawaiian Village was an extreme disappointment. I stayed in Diamond Head Tower. You could tell the rooms had been somewhat renovated, but there was still an old and delapidated feel to them. The elevators were also very old and dirty. I had to put in a maintenance request the first day (air wasn’t working properly and tub was clogged). The maintenance team responded very quickly. As a Hilton Gold Member, you will receive $10/day for food. That will get you half a sandwich. If that. Things are ridiculously expensive, even at the on-site Starbucks. The gym was very nice, but it’s only open from 5 am to 9 pm. Now for the good... the hotel is in a great location, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the adjacent Bazaar. I also really enjoyed the fireworks show. ","December 17, 2018"
Exactly what you should expect from Hilton.Great location and great service. Just ask and they will do it. We had a late flight on our way home and decided to take a snorkeling trip after checkout. They found a way to give us hospitality room free of charge so we cant take shower and rest before departure.,"December 17, 2018"
"We joined the whole family here at Hilton Hawaiian Village to celebrate my in-laws' 50th anniversary. A large group with family members from 10 to 75, this was an excellent choice. Typically, my husband and I stay at smaller properties, so this was our first experience with something this large. We were in an ocean-view room in Rainbow Tower, which gave us a view north of the hotel of a marina. Be aware, as it's apparently another level to get a southern view of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach proper. No complaints, just good to set your expectations properly when you select your room. We loved Rainbow Tower as it was steps from the main pool on the beach and the beach itself. And we were able to watch the sunset from our balcony, which was lovely.Even with family members in other towers -- Diamond Head and Tapa -- we found it quite efficient to meet up when needed. The central pool area was an easy meeting point, but we'd typically just meet in the lobby of Diamond Head. The whole set up was quite nice, with shopping, coffee, ice cream and amenities all right there. We were about a 10 minute walk from the main strip of Waikiki, and it was really nice to have this ""village"" feel to come back to, rather than stepping right out onto the main drag. The Diamond Head Tower overlooked the Tapa pool -- this was a more relaxed pool in the daytime. The bar there had a musical duo that played at night. Apparently those in Diamond Head Tower could hear the music into the night, but didn't find it disruptive. My only complaints -- the hotel did seem to run on surcharges. The towel system is one to be aware of from the outset -- at checkin, you're given 2 towel cards, which you exchange for towels. Give a card, get a towel. Return a towel, get a card. At checkout, you must turn in 2 towel cards, or you'll be charged a fee. The resort fee seemed excessive ... $40 day for amenities that didn't quite materialize, especially considering the size of the resort. Overall, no one goes to Hawaii expecting bargains, and for the price, this was an excellent value. I do see a lot of notes about the state of the hotel, which had me worried pre-trip. Be aware that they started renovating each tower, and we found our room in Rainbow Tower to be quite comfortable and in good shape. The property itself had *gorgeous* landscaping. It was just beautiful and well-kept.","December 16, 2018"
"This is a large complex, right on the beach. The service and communication from employees were excellent...very helpful and friendly. Check in and check out were easy. The room was spacious and well maintained with an ocean and partial beach view. There are lots of shops, restaurants, and bars, but prices are high.","December 16, 2018"
"First, let me say that service and smiles are everywhere at the Hilton Villages. But, everyone I know dreams of visiting Hawaii at least once in a lifetime. I'm lucky, I lived here for nine years, then my wife's company asked her to come out and lead training for 64 mid-level executives for a week. I immediately jumped on the event and spent four days there, again. I was looking forward to spending time at the Village, it represented one of those great resorts, beautiful, modern, intimate, entertaining, any way you get the idea.Well, it wasn't. It's old and broken down. I do not recommending spending the amount of money they're currently asking for, you can get a much nicer experience with half the cost. Sure, location, location, location, but honestly, the rooms suck. The bed, sucks. The shower, sucks. The lack of maintenance is ever present. There's nothing open when you're hangry in the early am (I'm a runner, so you get the idea). There's only one or two people working at starbucks, only place to get coffee besides the itty-bitty half-cup of coffeemaker in the room. At least the refrigerator worked. I've stayed in some pretty bad places, but this place has the half-truth of Oz. All shiny on the outside, but just holding on behind the scenes. Find somewhere else or negotiate a better deal. OH, and don't forget about the rocking music until 0100...that horrible European club dance music sound all night long. We were in the Diamondhead tower.","December 16, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village is a clear choice for visitors to Waikiki. It sits on the best section of beach, somewhat set off from everything else, and is almost a small city unto itself. It is that big, almost overwhelming so. The Ali'i Tower provides further sanctuary and comfort. It is not quite a stand-alone resort, but it does occupy a favorable location, and an higher level of amenities. Our room showed some wear and tear, which was mildly disappointing. Overall, though, Ali'i is worth what you will have to shell out to stay there. ","December 15, 2018"
"I am sorry but $300-$400 night, with mandatory activity fee of $40/night added on top, is not woth it for a room that looked just any other hotel room with a 5 out of 10 rating across America. The rates should include this fee, since you get charged, whether you use it or not. Oh, I am from CANADA and the $ exchange is another 30%","December 15, 2018"
Hotel had beautiful carved wood in outdoor lobby and tall ceilings in individual room and bathroom. Felt like I was in a palace with giant tub and mirror. Comfortable bed and room was squeaky clean! Short walk to anything you want! Excellent stay.,"December 15, 2018"
"Shame on you Hilton, at no point and in no advertising does it mention you need to hold a JTB card to attend the ‘inclusive’ poolside Friday night entertainment (and is the case for 6 months apparently). The fact that there are 60+ empty seats and non-Japanese are made to feel like second class citizens is bordering on racism. Shame, shame, shame.","December 14, 2018"
This place has been amazing. My wife and I are on our honeymoon and the hotel upgraded us to a nice tower on the village. We have been treated like royalty and amazing staff and views! Highly recommend!,"December 14, 2018"
"We stayed in the Tapa Tower and had a partial ocean view (see images). This is an expansive crowded resort. The rooms were dated, not cleaned properly and not to the Hilton standard I have experienced in city Hilton properties. It appeared the different towers had different levels of room quality, and we were at the conference facility standard of room. Even on a high floor we had a lot of traffic noise in the evenings. Eating is very expensive so we looked elsewhere for our meals except for one evening where we had a take out pizza from Round Table Pizza which was surprisingly good. Now to the good things - five pools although only one seemed heated, beautiful landscaped gardens, direct access to Waikiki beach, easy walk to shopping malls and to Waikiki night life. We felt like we were staying at Disneyland or in a shopping mall. To put things into context all of the big resort properties on Waikiki beach are expensive and some don't even give you a balcony to enjoy the evenings. We at least had that.","December 13, 2018"
"The location is great but the hotel itself needs to be upgraded. The daily rate is very expensive and we had to pay $40 resort fee per day but we don't know where the resort fee goes because when you go to the beach, we had to pay $18 for the beach chairs and a separate fee for the beach umbrella. The hotel is so packed and there's so many people it's like Disneyland. My friends room has bedbugs. She had so many bites and the hotel confirmed that there are bedbugs in the room but they refuse to reimburse her for their stay. The restaurant food is not good. Disappointing stay.","December 13, 2018"
"This was our first stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Everything from food to parking is very expensive and the resort fee covers very little. Also, very noisy late into the evening/early morning.","December 13, 2018"
"Great view from the Tropics bar and grill, room view from the Rainbow Tower, and of course the beautiful Waikiki beach. This hotel captures it all. Great onsite shopping, Luau and Friday night Fireworks!","December 13, 2018"
"This is a nice resort. I'm going to publish two reviews, one of the Grand Islander where we stayed and another for the resort overall (this one). The resort is very large with many ""towers"", nice beach areas, lots of pools. Hawaii 5 O was filming on site one day so that was cool. We stayed 5 nights here, and had stayed 4 nights previous at the Hilton Garden Inn in Waikiki. We turned in the rental car when we came here since we did all of our running around previously and the price to park a car is very high. We did not eat at any on site restaurants, we chose to venture into the Waikiki area. The shops on site are all very touristy, very expensive, there are better options in town but they are also very expensive. Beach towels are small and you have to keep trading them in and out and get ""cards"" to get new ones. We actually used the Hale Koa beach most of the time as it was far less crowded and just as nice (we're military but they don't check anyway). Overall, it was a nice stay, after 5 nights I was bored and ready to leave. The ""sales pitch"" for the time share was horrendous, it ruined our day...but I'll cover that in the next presentation. Hilton Diamond Member, but we felt like they don't care about you or do anything for you unless you are an owner or becoming an owner. We'd stay elsewhere next time, but if you have never been here and are a Hilton member, like the beach and very developed/touristy area, this place is probably fine.","December 13, 2018"
"Best vacation ever. We spent our 35th wedding anniversary here. The entertainment, food, and Hotel were all great. We really enjoyed this first time experience. It was like a second Honeymoon.. We're already planning on returning for our 40th Reunion...","December 12, 2018"
"The resort pools, lagoon and waterside are all amazing. Our kids loved them. The grounds are tropical and Friday night fireworks were great. It was just a short 6minute walk along the beach pathway to waikiki beach.The room we stayed in was dated and there was very little hot water available for a warm shower at the end of the day.Overall a beautiful place to stay as we never spend a lot of time in our room.","December 11, 2018"
"Everything was terrible. Where do I begin.. for what you pay to stay in this tacky, run down and overly commercial place, the least the staff could do is offer a friendly smile or some type of customer service.I went to the reception desk on one occasion and the staff member talked in a foreign language to another staff employee and both laughed at me, I was not impressed with this childish bullying. The staff then spoke in English while loudly whinging about their other staff and management. (Again bullying). I'm on holiday, trying to relax and I don't want to wait 10 minutes whilst you rag on about your job before you serve me with a bad attitude, huffing and puffing. The hotels and decor are tacky and nothing about this place is authentic. The rooms are out dated, ice machine didn't work, the lobbys, pools, outdoor areas are over crowded and just unpleasant. Do yourself a favour, stay else where so you don't regret your stay.","December 11, 2018"
Tapa Tower of Hilton Hawaiian Village needs renovation as it is outdated most especially the bathroom. The cleaning staff is very nice and very accommodating. The facility and area outside is beautiful.,"December 11, 2018"
"We really enjoyed our (second) vacation at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The housekeeping staff does a wonderful job with the rooms and the groundskeepers keep the property beautiful. The rental equipment at the Lagoon is kind of over at the top but that’s what you expect. Two lounge chairs and Umbrella - $65. An hour paddleboard rental is $40. A half-day cabana rental is $75.Tropics restaurant is really good and has nightly entertainment. We also enjoyed the Round Table pizza and CJ’s deli for a casual lunch or dinner. Rocky’s, f.k.a as Benihana, is a must. Terrific food and ‘show’. Lappert’s has really yummy ice cream and desserts.","December 10, 2018"
"We stayed for 6 nights, with our 6 year old and 4 year old. We stayed in the tapa tower. The room was partial ocean view with 2 double beds. It was a well sized and spacious room but dated and a little tired looking. We did consider upgrading for a little more to the rainbow tower. We visited and although the rooms are a little newer with slightly more contemporary finishes, the room and bathroom was quite a lot smaller. We opted to stay in the tapa tower, which worked out fine. There are also few amenities in the room. Ie no bowls and spoons. We were advised to get some disposable bowls from the ice cream store on the resort. Didn’t expect that from a Hilton hotel. Our towel sets provisions were inconsistent also. I would have thought they knew there were 4 people in the room for 6 nights... due to the service and basic amenities, I have given a lower rating. The resort is huge and the pools are great, very well landscaped and very pretty. The lagoon pool with 4 water slides to suit different ages is close to the lagoon tower and is a short 5 minute walk away - depending on how quickly your little ones walk ;)Lewers st is the closest area if you are looking for avoid selection of restaurants. 5 minute walk along the beachfront ( or 15 with kids :)) Otherwise within the resort there is a pizza restaurant, and typical hotel restaurants. ","December 10, 2018"
"Hilton took great care of us! They upgraded us to a beautiful suite with two balconies. The prices at the resort are quite high, but what you would expect for a premium location. Stephanie brought us drinks by the pool (Thanks Stef!) We sat through a timeshare presentation by JT, we decided not to buy, but we were treated with the utmost respect and she was respectful of our time. A great trip, thanks Hilton!","December 10, 2018"
Picked this resort for lacation to board our cruise the next day. I am a Hilton Diamond member and this night was my 80th night in a Hilton this year. The check in line for Hiltons Honors memebers had only one person working in it. My check in took 40 min. I had booked a resort view room and was given a few of resort trash and parking garage. See enclosed photo. I would recommend staying anywhere else but here when they treat their loyal Diamond customers this way.,"December 9, 2018"
"This hotel has it all, beach, pools, shopping, dining, spa, boat dock for cruises and kids camp. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The prices for shopping and dining are mixed throughout the property from way too high to reasonable. Some of the negatives for me was the crowded pools, difficulty finding a pool chair and lack of umbrellas for shade. You can easily get an umbrella on the beach but it is unreasonablely costly to rent, as is the cost of a chair. The hotel offers a few differ sailings off of their private pier. I took the sunset cruise and it was worth the price. The rooms are a bit worn and could use some updating but they were very clean. I was in the Rainbow Tower and had a nice view of the harbor. The Spa was excellent. Great selection and wonderful staff. Well worth a visit for some true relaxation. The distance from the airport made this hotel an easy pick for me.","December 9, 2018"
"After traveling for 14 hours our airport shuttle dropped us off in an underground drop off area. The driver told us just go through the doors. We went through the doors and there is NO SIGNAGE at all telling you where to go. We found a desk and assumed it was the check in, It was not we were told to go to the elevator and then go out the doors and you will find the check in. Well we were tired and following the signage was not the best. Then we had a long wait to get checked in. Please make this easier ,very poor. We were there for our honeymoon so the check desk said oh let us upgrade your room. Was not worth the extra charge. They do not do anything for honeymooners except give you a voucher for two muffins. BIG DEAL!!!! The room in the Diamond Head tower was ok. The bed was too soft and had a back pain for our entire stay as did my wife.The beach area great. All the restuarants on site are expensive. You can find less expensive food on the Waikiki Strip, Would I stay here again probably not.","December 9, 2018"
"My partner and I stayed in the rainbow tower and loved the diamond head/ocean view.I thought check-in was slow, but another reviewer said they have 4000 rooms, so I guess that explains it. Will try digital check in next time.Had no issues with resort fees as I declined to pay for things we weren't going to use and they were waived.In summary, a wonderful stay and we're looking forward to our next stay in November 2019.","December 8, 2018"
"What a wonderful way to relax and have all the amenities within walking distance. Our three nights and four days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village on Waikiki beach was spectacular . The rooms were spacious with a balcony and the bathroom was neat and clean. There are many restaurants and shops to explore and of course the beautiful Waikiki Beach to enjoy with amazing sunsets. What to know ahead of time is that there are four tours in the complex and it involves a lot of walking to get around. In conclusion, the service and people are wonderful.","December 8, 2018"
"The hotel was 30 minutes from the airport. The Check in was smooth and super friendly. Our room was in Ali’i building which was probably the best option for singles without kids because this one had less kids and had exclusive pool (with less kids). We only got in the pool in our building , the lagoon and the pool near the lagoon (which was crowded with kids). Take in mind that the hotel is not located in the center of Waikiki but it’s closer to the beautiful Moana beach park. The hotels provides variety of high luxury brands so if you’re into shopping you can do it between the pool and dinning. I think the hotel should not allow kids to get in the hot tub since it’s not healthy and recommended for them. Loved the gym in Ali’i building. If you are a fan of a very big resort this is exactly the place and you won’t need to get out of it. In general the experience was positive but I don’t think I’d go back , maybe when I get my own family . :-)","December 7, 2018"
"Not much has changed with the hotel accommodations since 2014. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower again. Rooms looked exactly the same except for some wear and tear. Walls need to be repainted. Desk chair needs to be replaced. Rooms are spacious. Bathrooms are nice. Staff is great at this hotel. Always there to help make your stay better. Ask the maids for more towels!Differences noted since 2014...This hotel has become big with young families. Lots of babies! Rainbow Tower was very quiet at night. The young families go in early and stay in for the night.The shopping area onsite is much improved. Lots of really great stores like SoHa, Crazy Shirts, Honolulu Cookie Company, ABC...many, many more. They stay open until 10 pm which is great! Avoid the small Hilton Market store to the left of Tropics. Prices are ridiculous in there. Go to ABC or a local food store for bottled water and snacks for the room fridge.Also noticed the hotel is booking more big conventions. On both our stays this time - coming and going from Australia - conventions were taking over a few of the hotel restaurants for private parties. That made Tropics more crowded than usual. We waited about 40 mins to get seated at Tropics. Ended up at a table in the back next to some really loud men. One guy was so loud, it was impossible to hear the band playing up front. After that experience, we ventured out to restaurants off-property since we had a car.The main pool still gets very crowded as does the beach. You have to pay for loungers at the beach, otherwise you can just use a towel that you get at the nearby stand. Pools aren't heated and were chilly. Ocean water was perfect! The pool-side servers are great! They get your drinks and food to you quickly.Still only two hot tubs, which are usually crowded with little kids despite signs saying over 5 only. Personally, I think the hot tubs should be for adults only. Who wants to go in and soak your sore muscles with a baby in a diaper? Disgusting! Seems parents take the young kids in the hot tubs to get them relaxed before bed/nap time. Older kids were playing in the hot tubs jumping in and out and just being annoying. Impossible to relax with that going on.So, if you are spending a few days on Oahu, I recommend the Hilton Hawaiian Village. It has everything onsite that you'll need. The beds are comfortable. Rooms are spacious. Great location. Affordable rates. Great views of Diamondhead.Complaints: TV was lousy. Remote was impossible to work. Rarely reacted when you pushed buttons.Rollaway beds are $80/night + taxes. Crazy!!! Since there were three of us in a room with two doubles, I broke down and got a rollaway our last night. Other hotels we stayed at the rollaway beds were either free (Westin/Marriott) or $20 (Holiday Inn).One complaint: the TV remote was a pain to operate. The TV package lacking many popular channels.","December 6, 2018"
"Review your bill carefully to make sure the hotel does not overcharge you. At the end of our recent stay at this hotel, we received a folio that included $150 in valet charges even though we did not have a car and never used the valet. We had to speak with the manager on duty to get these charges reversed. After we returned home, our bank notified us that the hotel had charged us $20 when our card was not present. When we called the hotel billing office, they said it was for our pool towels and asked what we had done with our pool towel cards. When we said we had left them in our room with our key when we checked out, they said they would reverse the charge but it could take up to a week. When staying at this hotel, it's hard to get out to the street as you can leave the property only from one side or the other but not in the middle. The restaurants are mediocre and overpriced. Our room in the Diamond Head Tower faced the Hale Koa Hotel next door, which meant we heard their delivery vehicles beginning at 5 am each morning if we left our sliding glass door open and their music until 10:15 pm on weeknights and 11:15 pm on weekends. Our room had a small fridge but no microwave. It has a desk chair but no comfortable arm chair. My husband, who is mobility impaired, needed cart assistance from his event to our room, but at least once had to wait up to a half hour for it.","December 6, 2018"
"We stayed at HHV every summer in the 1980's. This is our first trip back since then. The Village is as amazing and as beautiful as almost 40 years ago. It is self-contained-ABC stores, jewelers, clothing stores, luggage stores, eateries of all stripes, etc. With 4000 rooms, the check-in desk is bustling 24-7. The beaches (public) are pristine and the water beautiful. There is even a Church on the Beach which has operated there for 49 years and is open to all faiths. We actually found the food competitive in taste and price. The only complaint I have is the soundproofing between rooms. Our neighbor played loud music night and day, beginning at 7.20 a.m.(perhaps they are having a staycation in their room). After security visited, they would lower the volume, but we could still hear the music and their voices. As soon as security left, they started up again. We finally asked to be moved. I feel bad for whoever ended with the room next. The next room was quiet, because we had nice neighbors. But because of the location and convenience, and customer service, I still rate them a 5.","December 6, 2018"
"This place is super family friendly, which is awesome, unless you are traveling sans child, which was the case for us. I was there on a friends trip over Thanksgiving. Staff was wonderful, except for the lady at checkout and every employee at any of the Starbucks within the resort. We used Hilton points and were given an upgrade to the am ocean view room, which was in the Kalia Tower, which is very, very tired. At first I thought that wouldn’t be a very big deal since we weren’t there to be in the room. Except there were children screaming, yelling and having fun on vacation everywhere. I’m not saying kids shouldn’t be allowed to have fun on vacation but it would be nice if one of the several pools was kid free and the rules about no kids in the one hot tub I could find were enforced. But it’s close to everything and was a good deal with points. I just probably wouldn’t stay there again. ","December 4, 2018"
"When we arrived we were placed in the Diamond head tower, this was a much lower standard than we expected from Hilton. As we had gone to Hawaii to get married, to say I was disappointed was an understatement. I was in tears and when we went to the desk we were told that we had already had an upgrade, however I have had better rooms in Blackpool. It was very dated, musty smelling, the carpets were 70's nylon ,worn and questionable on cleanliness. I had not imagined getting married from a room like this. We asked for another room and ended up paying another $899 for an upgrade. After this we moved to the rainbow tower which was much nicer, however still a bit tired and in need of refurbishment. At least this room was fresher, cleaner and more pleasant with an outstanding view. The staff were lovely, very friendly, helpful and attentive, and the food was excellent. It was nice to have shopping on hand too, and a beautiful location with a stunning beach.","December 4, 2018"
"I highly recommend this resort if you stay in Honolulu. The rooms are large, clean and very comfortable. We look out onto the ocean. There are many restaurants available, the Japanese restaurant Rocky's is amazing and there is live entertainment every night! I would come back here again.","December 4, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) resort is a city within a city. A whopping 23 acres that sits oceanfront, with almost 4000 rooms in eight different towers. Six pools, 22 restaurants, and 2000 employees- a mammoth of a resort. Last fun fact (I looked it up), it's Hilton's largest hotel and the 17th largest hotel in the world. The idea behind the resort was to build enough infrastructure and amenities, that you would never need to leave the property during your whole vacation. This is what happens for a lot of the people who stay here. It is easy to do, except for the fact there is so much to do and see/eat in Honolulu. I could never be stuck at the hotel.We booked a room for five nights completely with Hilton Honors points. Doing so bad some great perks, like fifth night free, and zero ""resort fees"", which is a total scam used by almost every hotel now. I had zero interest in renting a car, then paying $50 a day just to park said car at the hotel. I find Uber and Lyft is actually much more convenient and economical when traveling to Honolulu (That is for my situation, YMMV).Check in is normally 15:00, but we arrived around 11:00. Upon arrival, there were no rooms with king sized beds available at the time. We opted for a room with two twin beds, and was able to check in early. The staff was simply amazing, every single person we spoke to orInteracted with. Huge shout out and mahalo to Liz at the Hilton Honors Diamond counter who did so much to accommodate us. She even let me go see another room in another tower, to compare and let me choose which one I wanted. Unreal!The room I chose was on the 9th floor in the Rainbow tower, overlooking the lagoon. It was spacious, clean, and had everything you would want in a hotel room, aside from a microwave. Perhaps Hilton prefers you not heat/reheat food, but to eat at one of their on-site establishments. Walls were sorta thin, as we could hear the neighbors and just about anybody walking and talking in the hallway. It wasn't that big of a deal though, as I'm sure the next room over could also hear us as well. Almost all stores and restaurants on the property were resort prices, which means about 15-20% or so more expensive than you would find off-property.Sometimes that was annoying, but most of the time it was very convenient. The ABC stores were the exception, and their prices were the same as they are everywhere else. This is the best place to buy bottled water, .99 for a liter and a half. The resort itself is spread out, so walking between towers and pools is interesting. There is a lot to see and people watching is always interesting. There are thousands of people from all over the world here at once. One negative I can think of is the quality of food at the Rainbow lanai. They charge $40 for the breakfast buffet. There is quite a variety to choose from, but overall quality is 100% not worth the hefty $40 price tag. That buffet should be $30, tops. I think it was until recently. Wi-Fi worked pretty well throughout the trip, dropped off a few times, but came back up after a renewed lease. Elevators were always pretty fast, and not that full. One other thing that comes to mind is their Uber/Lyft policy. Unlike almost every other hotel, they don't allow pickups at the main lobby, or anywhere else but a designated spot at the far end of the resort. This was humbug for us, as we were on the exact opposite end. Therefore, to catch a ride meant walking across the 23 acres to reach the pick up spot. I don't know the rule on drop off, but I had the drivers drop us off at the main lobby each time. If you are in the mood for the resort life, for a million people around you, non stop movement, and a very busy environment, this is the place for you. If you are trying to have rest and relaxation that includes quiet time and privacy, you may want to look elsewhere.If I had the chance to stay here again, I might. However, I think there are so many places to stay in Honolulu/Waikiki, I may prefer to stay in some other ones first, before coming back right away.","December 4, 2018"
 After an extremely long day didn’t need a 30 minute check in at 11 o’clock at night the excessive charges of amenity fees charged by Hilton who said it was just on hold unfortunately by the time I got to my room 30 minutes later I was notified that this church had already been processed the following morning I got another charge for $55 then called the front desk and the young lady assured me that these would be credited back to my account and to date eight days later no credit yet The accommodations were comfortable some what the seating in the room was very dated and will warn other than Knapp the room size for sleeping was quite comfortable and clean and my last complaint was the smoking area for I think they were for towers of between 19 and 35 stories each one smoking area to accommodate perhaps 30 people very inadequate and there were lots and lots of People smoking from all walks of life check out could’ve been a little bit quicker rather than having to line up on a Saturday morning was only two people working the front desk,"December 3, 2018"
"Briefly, the resort is intimidating in its size. It was very crowded (great if you're an investor in the chain, but not if you're a visitor). Just too much. Restaurants on site -- difficult to get seated in a reasonable amount of time and inexcusably expensive. We (a relatively large group including kids spread in ages) finally started dining off-site at huge savings yet eminently enjoyable. Staff, especially dining and cleaning, were marvelous. Check-in is a design catastrophe. The Tapas Tower pool was enjoyed by kids galore and was endless fun for them. The other pools were too crowded and chair availability extremely competitive. The beach was clean but shade was scarce. Umbrella rentals were exorbitant and could be circumvented by going to the beach next door or buying a permanent one for less than a day's rental and selling it just before departure. The $40 DAILY mandatory extra fee is absurd. Either include what few things it covers like competition does or fold the extra charge into the daily price rather than hide it in fine print. This Hilton is off my list of future consideration.","December 2, 2018"
"Booked and prepaid 5 nights with pay 4 nights get 5th night free promotion through Hilton in Nov, right after I paid and I saw I have been charged 5nights actually so I called back and they said that don’t worry I will get the 5th night refund back when I check out. We checked in on 30th, and front desk just laughed and said no they won’t refund me anything, and then I called the Hilton and they said no refund . So the fact is that I paid 5 nights with 4 nights/5th free. Very disappointed and honestly ruined all the good vacation mood. I can’t believe this could happen at Hilton. If you wanna book Hilton with any deal, BE CAREFUL all the traps!","December 2, 2018"
"This was a fantastic place to stay. I must say the rooms were a little tired but apart form that the location was fantastic with the pools, spas and private beach area. That's not to mention the multitude of restaurants that were available. The only minus is it is a little bit of a walk into the town centre, but apart from that I would definitely stay here again!","December 1, 2018"

"Resort fee. Service fee. Delivery fee. Room service fee. However, you do get a free towel for the beach, which is quite rocky more than 25 feet from shore. You don't get snorkle equipment or fins or anything else. I paid $275 for a room that ended up costing $357 and we had no extras in that cost. If you just sat there it would cost $357. And, the shower handle was broken, leaked on the floor and wouldn't switch between shower and tub...although since the drain appeared to be blocked it didn't matter too much. The room was pretty noisy and we had no real view unless you lean on the balcony. We were on 15th floor of the Ali'i building. Had to wait for a table, wait for service, and wait for food and it was marginal at best. This is an overcrowded and overpriced hotel that is overtaxed even in off season.","November 30, 2018"

"Overall it was a great stay! My mom lives in Honolulu/Waikiki for work at the moment and this was an awesome place to be able to see her and enjoy all the resort features. Here are some things I want to point out to future guests:-Village seriously means village. It is HUGE and it seems like half the people on the property aren't guests there, they are just tourists walking through to shop or eat. So just be mindful of that. If you're looking for somewhere quiet and romantic, this is probably not for you.-You don't come in contact with too many employees just because it can get so crowded, but I wanted to give a shoutout to the 2 that stuck out to me. Thank you DAVID H. at the Front Desk during check-in for being so helpful and patient. He went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of in every way and that means more to me than anything. Also, thank you to TERRENCE/TERRY a bartender at the Tropics. So sweet and such a nice conversation while eating lunch!-The beds were CLOUDS. That alone was worth every cent to me.-Live music and fireworks on Friday nights was nice so that if you didn't want to venture far, there was always something going on minutes from your room.-Parking was absurd. $8 for half an hour or $34 for an entire day of SELF-PARKING. It seemed a bit steep and exploitative. Not sure if I would stay again simply because I was hoping for a quieter lodging experience, but that is my personal preference. For anyone looking for a large Hawaiian resort, I definitely recommend this Hilton!","November 30, 2018"
"My husband and I decided to go to Hawaii to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. I work at a hotel as a Front Desk agent, so I was eager to visit a Hilton Hotel and see what their service and amenities were like. Boy, was I completely underwelemed. First, upon making the reservation it asked if there were any special events we were celebrating. I said ""anniversary"". Nothing. No card, no chocolate, not even a ""happy anniversary"" at check in. At my hotel, the MINIMUM is a card with a favour (chocolate bar, or seasonal chocolate covered fruit), sometimes upgrades. Now, I didn't expect an upgrade (because that's a loss in revenue) but how hard is it to get something small and ""personal"" ? Throughout the ""customer service"" emails, many of them keep telling me ""oh, well it's because you booked under the friends and family rate"" and ""we only have limited wedding favours"". What? If I get a discount on rooms I am uneligible to get a wedding favour? What about expedia/hotwire/booking.com guests? I still paid the outrageous parking and resort fees, does that not cover a small anniversary treat? We decided to try out the Benihana on the resort. Not only was our waiter 20 mintues late, SO WAS OUR CHEF. The place only had two tables and ours was only 4 adults and one child. When the Chef did show up, he was obviously very stressed, hardly talked or engaged with us. A pale comparison to the chef beside our table doing laser pointer effects and knife tricks for his table. The host didn't even offer us any complimentary drinks or a discount on the bill. Decided to try the pools. Despite the signs that say ""no swimming floaties"" nearly ALL the pools are full of children throwing balls or enormous floating rafts. I get it, people want to vacation with their kids and if you can afford it, you should do it! But PLEASE. Can you not let your kids cannonball and splash other guests? I was extremely underwelmed at the lack of service and the genuine friendliness. I understand that this resort has 500+ daily, but that is no excuse for a famous brand to fall short. We tried talking to the front desk in the tower (who shrugged and sent us over to the concierge citing, ""we don't do things like that""). Walked over to the concierge who told us to go to the main office. However, the main lobby is always PACKED full of people with long lines (even if you're a Hilton member). When I lodged my complaint I expressed that I would prefer to communicate via email as I'm outside of the country, and I'm very anxious over the phone. Did they listen? Nope. They called my cellphone while I was at work. I checked the status of my complaint and the agent told me it was ""complete"" as they had ""called multiple times"". Are you kidding me? You called once. Didn't even leave a message or anything. When I re-opened my case the person on the phone (again, I asked them not to call but they did anyway) was VERY unsympathetic and basically made me feel bad for lodging a complaint. Not only that, they offered NO discount or any solutions. I was the one who asked for ""one night free parking"". Unbelievable. I should have asked for 4 nights! Now, I'm a pretty patient person. And even making this post has my stomach in knots, but I think others should know and be aware of what their ""customer service"" is like. As a Canadian and a Front Desk agent at a 4-star hotel, I am completely and utterly unimpressed and disappointed.","November 29, 2018"
"“No you cannot have room next to your friends.” I called ahead and asked if I can have a room near our friends staying in the tower. I was told that it wouldn’t be a problem and just ask at check-in. We get to check-in and make request and after the employee doing a lot of clicking we were told no they couldn’t do as our rooms were pre-assigned. Kind of annoyed we were told earlier it would be fine.If you’re Hilton Diamond, be prepared to get nothing! The rooms themselves were dated and no upgrades were available at check-in. Rather than free breakfast we were given a $10/day resort credit, which isn’t enough to buy anything here! No lounge to be found. Asked for late check-out on last day and we were told it wasn’t possible. I expected when I go on vacation and I have hotel status I’ll be treated with some perks as a reward for all the spending I do with the brand throughout the year. Additionally, the retail and food options were heavily marked up by 20-50% of what you would pay off-resort. The wi-fi was terrible and it often took 5 minutes to re-connect to it each time. My next complaint is that there were tons of children and families everywhere. The Sheraton (next door) has a large adult-only area with bar and infinity pool. The Hilton Village has over 10 pools but no area that adults only. We just wanted to relax without screaming children!We also noticed the last of the restaurants and bars in the resort were closed by 10pm, which is very early when I’m on vacation. We came home one night from the bar after midnight to find there isn’t even 24-hour room service at this property. One nice thing is after you check-out you can book a hospitality suite for 1 hour (before 6pm) for free to rinse-off and freshen up before going to the airport. Compared to the rest of Hawaii where everyone was warm and welcoming and accommodating, we found the staff on this property to be unfriendly and unhelpful. If you want an adult vacation do not stay at this property!","November 29, 2018"
"I signed up for a duplicate bridge convention where they waived the resort fee and charged $220/night. I recently signed up for Hilton Honors which with $5.00 will get you a cup of coffee. Rooms in the Tapa tower were a little dated but great view. Water in the tub was not consistent as far as staying at the proper temperature. Maids were great. This was one of the first times that the hotel ever charged me for the visit before the stay started. ABC convenience stores there were great and reasonably priced. The buffet was $40/person for adults. You have to eat lots of papaya and eggs to justify that. Service was excellent though. Room was upgraded for about $30/night for a view in the Tapa tower. Their first ""offer"" was to move me to another tower for something like $60/night more. The breakfast dining room (not the buffet) was not very good and by the time you get your eggs, drinks its about $30/person. Omelettes are better at the free breakfasts at the Embassy Suites. Best things: Happy hour starting at 4:30 at the Tapa bar with $7 MaiTais that are good, $6 beer, and wings and pizza and things like that are good and reasonably priced The hotel also has the Wiki Wiki shop has breakfast bagels etc for a reasonable price and are take out.  My daughter went to rent a surf board and the attendent said to rent it accross the street where the boards weren't waterlogged. They were also 1/3 the price. This place is OK but not the best by a long way.","November 29, 2018"
"Stayed here for about a week. The first day, the housekeeping was wonderful. After that it went steadily downhill. When we were walking to our room on two separate occasions, we had to navigate between the housekeeping carts that were blocking the hallway. Usually they have them sitting alongside the wall, but twice they were blocking the entire hallway, with a tiny path that we had to find our way through. There were a couple of housekeeping carts in the same place at the same time which made it difficult to get through. We stayed in the Ali'i tower which has it's own separate check-in, but the people behind the counter didn't seem to care who came in when, they just grabbed whoever they saw first. Food at the restaurants in this hotel is incredibly overpriced, but I guess that's typical for Honolulu area resorts.","November 29, 2018"
"We checked in today and will be staying here for the next five days. I’m feeling negative about the place. When we first walk inside the room, there was a moth flying around (somebody came in to remove it). Bathroom light flickering. Comforters are old. ( felt like a haunted room ) Totally ruined my first day. Honestly, we stayed in Best Western by the airport before we moved here. It was way better, we should have just stayed there. How is a 2star hotel better than a 4star hotel? Unbelievable.","November 29, 2018"
"We came to the Hilton Hawaiian Village for a family reunion. There were 32 of us, so finding a reasonably priced place was a must (check- at least for Hawaii). There were several restaurants in property. Lunch service near the beach was slow (45 min to get food). Staff was friendly, but little service. Spa was a pleasant surprise. We really enjoyed our messages. Onsite Luau far exceeded our expectations.","November 28, 2018"
"Believe all of the bad reviews. This hotel is rundown, overcrowded, overpriced, and lacks a basic sense of hospitality.Check in: Long lines for check in. The lobby has no chairs or couches whatsoever. So if you're in a large party (like us) everyone needs to stand and wait. I saw kids wrestling in the middle of the lobby because there is nothing else to do while waiting. Once we got to the check-in desk, it took more than 30 minutes for them to sort out our rooms. We were a large party and they mixed up who should be rooming with whom. My husband and I asked for a room next to our two teenagers' room. They sent us on our way (no help with luggage, btw. I guess the $40/day resort fee doesn't cover that) and we found out that they put our kids in a completely different hallway from us. So we had to go BACK to the guy at the check in counter and have him fix it again.Room: Finally got to the room and the couch had a fresh black stain on it (ink?) that was still wet. The A/C didn't work, and 2 out of 4 lamps didn't work. Outlets were coming out of the sockets. (Photos included.)Pools: pools are overcrowded and it's impossible to find a lounge chair. Beach is nice but there is no shade and you have to spend $35 to rent an umbrella, which is criminal. Just go to Costco and buy your own umbrella, save yourself the grief.Restaurants: these are expensive ($40 for a normal breakfast, nothing fancy) and the lines are long but I have to say the waiters and waitresses at the restaurants are all top notch.This hotel relies heavily on tourists from Japan, Korea and China. I guess these tourists are okay spending lots of money, because all of the shops on site are ridiculously priced and I wouldn't consider buying anything there. Also, because so many of the guests are international, the restaurants and bars have to remind them about tipping. I understand why this is important, and the waiters and waitresses certainly deserve their tips, but after you see 100 notices telling you to tip, it feels obnoxious.Bottom line: Hotel management should be embarrassed. Don't believe any of the responses on tripadvisor about how much they value your feedback. They know exactly what the problems are, and do nothing to fix it.The only reason I'm giving the hotel 2 stars instead of 1 is because I got to spend a week with my family while there, and spending time with family made up for everything.","November 28, 2018"
"This is a huge hotel, like 3800 rooms. The pools are way to small for this many guests. The room was ""partial ocean view"" but not ocean sounds just traffic, horns, and motorcycles. Not very pleasant. The beach was nice and much less crowded than farther down Wikaiki. Friday night was a Hawaiian themed show that was so lame had to leave to keep from being sick. This show maybe would appeal to my grandfather and I am 72 so it was pretty old fashioned. Then the good part the fireworks show on the beach was fantastic. Felt like the show was right over head and very impressive.Room was very ordinary. Also there is a $40 a day resort charge for really nothing. Free wifi that any hotel provides for free.Save your money go somewhere else. If you want to go to Hawaii choose the big island or Maui. Don't go the Wakaiki.","November 27, 2018"
"---Important Points for Hilton Honors Members---The HH app will tell you this hotel has digital keys It does not. The HH app will tell you this hotel will give you free continental breakfast. It will NOT. ---I arrived late so there was no bell service, no concierge and no lines at the counter. The guy checking us in was perhaps not in the best mood or maybe it was the fact that it was 11 PM but I didn't get the warm welcome I was expecting. I was promised a bouquet of roses for my wife but didn't get em. Then he just pointed to our towers and sent us on our way. The resort can definitely use some updates. Our room carpet was wet, doors were dirty especially the bathroom door. I got a 5th floor room in the Rainbow Tower and made sure it is an ocean front room not an ocean view room. The view from our balcony was very good. Throughout our stay, it was where we ate, drank, relaxed and watched the fireworks. The room itself was pretty average (small). There is no microwave. There is no safe. There is an old PS3 and a LED TV (it will come in handy). ---Food----Bad. Bad. Bad. Very few good choices available. Plenty of restaurants but all of them are resort priced and food quality is average at best. Please avoid Wiki Wiki Market and Rainbow Lanai. Their food is horrible. Breakfast options at CJ's Deli are good. Try Tropics for Lunch or Dinner. The hotel will give you $10 per guest per room daily. That amount can be deducted from your final bill. THIS is what they mean by free continental breakfast. They want you to go to Wiki Wiki Market and get an apple, coffeee and a toast for $10. Then use your $10 credit for that breakfast making it free continental breakfast. I went to Dennys and Ihop just down the street to pay the same $25-$30 per person but have decent choices and quality. A hidden gem is Blue Water Shrimp. Try their Fish and Chips for some decent quality price and portion. At Tropics I would recommend TBG signature burger, it's pretty good. ---Activities / Beach---When I went to Cancun, the resort had activities every day and night so you were never bored. HHV does not have activities for its guests especially after sundown. DO sign up for the time share at the concierge and get the biggest most expensive gift for it. I was skeptical about going to the presentation but it really was no pressure and I was out in 90 minutes. Enjoy it. Hanauma Bay snorkeling is a must do. I didn't know how to swim and had never done snorkeling but it was easy and well worth it. It will be about $29 per person. Very good deal. Do get an Iphone underwater case from the ABC store at the resort. At Hanauma Bay, it will cost a lot more for the same thing. Get the polynesian culture center. It is $150 per person but it is very good and includes food. Get it early because if you can't finish it in one day you can always go back. The ticket is good for 3 days. Starlight under light luau. Do that. It is what you see on TV with traditional dances and food. It is the most expensive activity on the resort. I would recommend using the timeshare gift for this. DO negotiate with the concierge to give you the MOST for your presentation sign up. Catamaran for the sunset cruise is okay. Nothing too special. You can get the one for lunch, that is a bit more expensive but it gives lunch and free drinks and you get to see dolphins and turtles. If you don't have an ocean front room or can't find a spot on the beach, you may also use this for the fireworks show on friday night. Beach chairs and umbrellas are expensive. About $67 for umbrella and two lounge chairs for a day (830AM to 5PM). Get the beach/reef shoes, floaties etc from ABC store. ---Vehicle Use---I didn't rent a car and it worked fine for me. I enjoyed the bus rides but if you rent a car, note that there is a minimum of $40 per day charge for parking. ---Drone Use--- You CAN use the drone on the beach. Use the app to figure out if its safe to fly. If you can fly early morning you will get the best footage and you won't piss off too many people. I flew everyday from the beach or my balcony. No issues. Also some people flew during the fireworks show on Friday.---Fireworks---Fantastic. Put down your phone and take it all in. It is about 10-15 mins but it's awesome. Friday night. ---People---Controversial but I didn't have the best experience interacting with local folks. Idk if they didn't like my face or what but I hardly encountered a pleasant person, from bus drivers to hotel staff to restaurant staff to park officials etc. Not the best impression but I hope it is different for you. I don't write reviews but I want to help anyone thinking of visiting this place. I hope it helps you. Oahu is beautiful. Remember, you do NOT have to do something everyday. Just relax and take it all in. Slow down. Do go around town and look at houses and stores and roads etc. It has its own charm. I hope you have a wonderful time! ","November 26, 2018"
"I booked a government rate for a resort tower about 8 months in advance. My parents arrived 2 days earlier and surprised us with paying for an upgrade to the Ali'i Tower. The private check in was less than 5 minutes but in all honesty, I read horror stories about the long lines and we never saw more than 6 people in the regular line during our stay. The Ali'i lobby and perks are great. They offer a private pool and bar, keurig coffee, bottled waters, robes, slippers, etc. When we got to our room we noticed some stains on the couch (let's just say it looked like someone changed a diaper on the couch). The trash was also not emptied in the bathroom. I called downstairs and they came up to spot clean it within an hour. The next morning we noticed some wrappers next to our bed as well so I called the housekeeping manager to let her know. She was pleasant but she sent someone up to our room, we showed her the room but NEVER HEARD BACK FROM ANYONE. SO confused! Why have someone come up if you are not going to move us or deep clean the room.All hotels in Waikiki are run down, crowded and outdated so I give this hotel a little more credit. I don't understand everyone's complaints about the crowds and amount of kids. We were there during Thanksgiving and we do not have kids but they never bothered us. We were a huge fan of Blue Shrimp and Roundtable if you are looking for a cheaper option. Also Goofy's for breakfast next door :)","November 25, 2018"
"I am frustrated posting this review because the truth is we were looking forward to visiting Hawai'i. Only to find that we were staying in an over-priced ""has-been"" hotel brand that will charge you an arm and a leg to give you below basic services.They will give you better service...but first you need to pay more! They will send water bottles to your room...but first you need to pay more! To pay the amount they charge for the rooms and amenities upfront only to find out you have to drink bathroom sink water because the mini-bars in the room are empty is ridiculous. Plastic silverwear for room service at a time when most people are trying to stop the use of plastic illustrates the out of touch ideas in circulation at this so-called ""hilton"" hotel. The Hawai'ian people working here are lovely. The daily staff try and do their best with what their given. I suppose my issue is with the top brass. So greedy that they have ruined the place. Sad. Disgraceful.","November 25, 2018"
"I have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) many times (and in different towers) on different vacations. The Ali'i Tower is more luxurious than other towers and benefits from a prime location, but your vacation won't be significantly reduced by staying in one of the other towers. For larger families, the Tapa Tower offers suite options that may be more cost effective than staying in two separate rooms. The HHV can be very busy and may feel a little far from the main Waikiki strip. However, the walk is not unpleasant and the HHV offers amenities that simply cannot be found via any of the other hotels in Waikiki. For families with very young children, the beachfront HHV is an excellent choice so the littles can enjoy their time in the surf and sun with safety. Some of the rooms may feel a bit dated, but for such a large chain property, the expense for complete renovations would be astronomical and result in higher prices for vacationers. Valet parking is an unwelcome charge for hotel guests, especially Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond members. The complimentary Friday Night Fireworks Show (weather permitting) is a nice beachside experience for your family. If your room faces the show you have the added benefit of a completely unobstructed view, and the beach crowds can feel a bit busy. However, sitting beachside for the show adds a wonderful ambiance for a very memorable social experience.","November 25, 2018"
"This hotel monstrocitity was probably awesome ... 30 YEARS AGO!!! The hotel buildings are old, dated and in need of repair. The restaurants are disgusting and way over priced. The stores are high dollar and snooty plus ALL the tour buses line up at this place so add dealing with thousands of people and being upcharged 40 bucks a day on top of the room charge, the ammenity charges, the walking on the grass charge, the breathing the air charge .... you get the picture. Much nicer hotels up the beach for far less money. Mahalo","November 25, 2018"
"I had been here as a kid about 20 years ago, and we chose to stay here for a brief 3-night stay in November. Made a last minute decision to upgrade to the Ali'i Tower, and thank goodness we did. Pros: The Ali'i Tower was nice -- room was renovated and clean (I'm really picky about this). Loved having the separate Ali'i pool with bar/service, unlimited towels and chair covers. Juice at Lanikai was good, and there was a (crowded) Starbucks on property.Cons: The hotel is crowded, and the chairs at the main pools are packed in like sardines -- some you can't even get to because it's so crowded. It's walkable to downtown restaurants and the main section of Waikiki Beach, but expect a 20 minute walk. It got old after the first day. Ali'i Tower hot tub was broken (didn't see anyone working on it at all). And, while we had partial ocean view (which was great), the room still backed up to an alley with early morning deliveries (and beeping trucks). Also couldn't get our safe working.Highly recommend signing up for Hilton Honors if you stay here -- the check-in line gets long, but there is a separate Honors desk.I'll stay elsewhere if we return, but it was decent for a short stay.","November 25, 2018"
"Resort fees are the crack cocaine of the hotel industry. Once a property institutes one, they only go up and they never go away. HHV is a classic example - the daily resort fee here is $40 a day, which covers essentially nothing they wouldn't offer without a resort fee. Why a resort fee? Because it allows the hotel to be less than transparent about the cost of staying here when consumers look at travel sites like Kayak. Those sites, and even Hilton's site, will show the ""room rate"" in price order, so consumers are duped into thinking they are getting value. Although in clever fine print the resort fee is disclosed, often travelers don't really know they're going to pay $40 a night above the room rate - sometimes 20% more then what they think they're paying - until check-in. It creates a tremendous lack of goodwill, poisons the ""first impression"" check-in experience, and generally cements the idea that the hotels are in the business they're in for cash first, actual hospitality last.This would all be OK if in return a guest had a tremendous room and resort experience. But in my Rainbow Tower room, there are more nicks, scratches, scuffs and ennui than I've seen in some 40-year-old unrenovated rooms. Rainbow Tower rooms are of a renovated early 2000s vintage, but the engineering department apparently never goes in to do preventative maintenance at all. Paint chips and furniture nicks, that in caring hotels are taken care of every three months with markers and touch up brushes, are literally all over the rooms here. TVs are tiny and could have been much larger for probably $50 more a set. The bathtubs in the rooms are sized for an 8-year-old and should be ripped out in king rooms in favor of a proper shower enclosure. The obvious message is ""we don't care; we don't have to.""HHV stands primarily on their location and their large footprint. Instead of operating in the mode of ""what can we do to continually enhance the experience?"", they operate in the mode of ""what new fees can we implement without pissing too many people off?"" It's a sad deterioration of hospitality.","November 25, 2018"
"We booked into this hotel as we had to cancel another one that would be affected by noise due to the Marriott strike,it all looks good on paper and brochures.When we arrived checkin in was a long wait, however the lady at the desk Winnie was very helpful.The charge $40 per day as a resort fee. plus taxThat too me is a plain Rip Off. They claim that covers wifi and some activities... really...That should be built into the room rate if that’s what they do...The room in Rainbow tower was ok by 1980s decor and is definitely looking dated. The chair in front of the desk had its vinyl very worn, the towel rail fell off.However the Tv is a decent size and the beds are fine as is the water pressure.This place is geared to make money off guests everywhere You have to pay exorbitant prices at the venue for drinks and snacks, breakfast is at $40 US per person?...The HAu tree snack and bar beach side is ok and has good service but again prices are way too high.. $11US for a draft beer in a plastic cup.You can have good lift access but the place is crowded wherever you go. You feel you are at a shopping mall at the beach...It’s hard to get a chair by the pool and they are all often all occupied.in full sun , with no umbrellas... the only shade provided by the towers themselves.There are pools around but due to the amount of people I don’t think they are large enough...The lagoon is cute and caters for children mainly.It even has its own Louis Vuitton shop for the Chinese shoppers and many other jewellery and clothing stores to entice you to buy. It’s also when booking to go to a luau a ploy to get people to sign up for a Time share lecture on Hilton Grand Vacations...Thank God for the ABC stores which can supply you with fruit beer and sushi etc as well as souvenirs etc... Housekeeping is so efficient ... they knock at your door before breakfast time. In my view this hotel is for the people that don’t want to see any other part of the town, they arrive to their room and don’t leave the property.... and are happy to pay whatever..It’s too far from the main Waikiki strip.. it’s a 20minute walk each way....If that’s the kind of traveller you are.. this hotel is for you...","November 24, 2018"
"Stayed in the Lagoon Tower (HGV Club) and the recent renovations are terrific. One of the best locations in the resort - convenient to beach, Lagoon, pools and shops. A village unto itself, you could stay and never leave.","November 24, 2018"
"Beautiful grounds, has everything you need in one spot. Very pricey, on top of daily tax charges you also have to pay for parking.Activities desk not properly staffed during busy time of day, only one person working the desk and it took me a hour of my vacation time to just book the pool cabana. The Topas pool only has one restroom stall for women, just unbelievable for such a large property, and the pool bar is not open during the week until 4:30pm. If you rent the pool cabana for the day, you have no one checking on you for service, you must go to the towel room to ask for assistance.We dined one night at the Paridaise Lounge, for two appetizers and two glasses of wine it cost 100.00 dollars! I’d walk off the property to dine if you have a family.The tower we were in, only had one - two elevators working the entire five days there, and on the 27 floor, wait time was 20 minutes for a elevator.Smoking is not allowed on the property which is great, but when you have no one monitoring the area, it’s awful, walking to Starbucks or the market was walking through clouds of cigarette smoke! This facility needs staff improvements and building updates.","November 24, 2018"
Hotel was nice but tower we were in the rooms were dated and dark. Too large and quite impersonal. No real customer service because too large. The housekeeping staff were amazing though and they were really friendly. Had to pay for a lounger on beaches which not used to having to do. But Honolulu is beautiful and plenty of places to eat so better to eat out of hotel. ,"November 24, 2018"
"Do some reading about this hotel before you book so you understand the type of experience you'll have. The Hilton Village is crowded, busy, there are stores everywhere, and lines for food at restaurants. The hotel itself is good. We stayed at the Tapa tower. The room was large and clean, and everything worked (fridge, wifi, A/C, good water pressure, etc.) The decor is aging. Housekeeping was very good - timely and efficient. The fitness center is impressive: it was large, clean and had very modern equipment. On the negative side, check-in was a zoo. Long, inefficient lines and several groups in my party had incorrect rooms assigned to them (which was eventually resolved). The resort fee is obnoxious. You're basically paying $40+tax for internet and gym use. Restaurants on campus are expensive but we assumed it was typical for Hawaii. Most of all there are lines and crowds everywhere: at Starbucks in the morning, at restaurants all day, at walks along the beach. If you're looking for a quiet, beach experience, keep looking.","November 24, 2018"
Our vacation had started out like any one of our trips to Hawaii except we changed to the Hilton Hawaiian Village at the last minute due to the Marriott strike. My wife and I were treating ourselves to a 1/2 day cabana rental and she was dozing and I stepped into the pool to cool off. I wasn't gone more than 2 min. When I returned I asked my wife where my Bose headset and kindle was. She sat up and asked me were are bag with my wallet was. Someone had apparently during broad daylight entered the cabana stole our stuff. I contacted the bartender who called security which tool about 10 min to arrive. We asked him to call the police who were there shortly and made are report. When talking with security it was determined that there are no security cameras on the property and basically one security guard that roams around. I then requested to talk to the manager who was no help at all and was irritated that we had contacted the police. If they have thieves roaming their property with no way of identifying them then there is no reasonable expectation of any security at all. For all I know they could kidnap a kid and no one would do anything.I was going to stay here again in Jan but have decided that this property is not for me..,"November 23, 2018"
Great location. Unlike other parts of Waikiki where the beach is disappearing their beach is still in great condition. The two main pools are very cold and kept a lot of people from enjoying. Food at Tropics on the beach had good food. Could use some help at check in helping people figure out the layout of the property if you are not in the main building. ,"November 23, 2018"
"Our family of 10 -2 families in Rainbow Tower and we were at the Alli tower. The rooms were immaculent and spacious ,housekeeping staff were great-friendly in hallways and very observant as soon as we would go out came back to cleaned/restocked room everyday ! The grounds are beautiful,fish ponds,flowers,exotic birds and walkways.There any many pools for a change of pace we tried them all and loved the Tapa pool,main pool and slide pool.-if no lounges available look around we always found someone leaving.We participated in the classes offered and included in resort fee,the woman who ran them was super-lei making,ukulele lesson and hula .We enjoyed the Lagoon even rented a large float with paddles that all 10 of us fit on-a blast ! The beach was clean,large and lake like warm,calm water !! LOVED the ABC stores 3 in complex for bfast,prepared lunch and dinners,snacks and treats affordable too !! Starbucks,pizza,Lamberts ice cream/DQ and lots of restaurants both on and off close by the property !!! yes,it's Hawaii more expensive than home but worth it !!The only problem was the 8 days went by too fast !! Worth the 12 hr flight for our family of 2seniors,4adults and 4 kids. Best location on Wakiki beach (when you arrive don't be overwhelmed with how busy it is -you will fit right in when you get more familiar)","November 23, 2018"
"Expensive food, would recommend a short walk to off site restaurants. Concierge desk seems more interested in selling Hilton activities than offering advice on 'outside' tours, shows etc. The resort itself truly is a 'village' - wonderfully designed and maintained. Best beach location. Terrific fireworks on Friday. Loved the whole experience!","November 22, 2018"
"If you are a family whose kids are into waterslides and that is tempting you about this place compared to others in the area, trust me — this isn’t what you are hoping for. The pool with the waterslides is small, overcrowded, and chilly as it’s in the shadow of the towers much of the afternoon. That pool has two of the three hot tubs in this giant resort and they are tiny (capacity 9) and packed to the brim (like 16 people, mostly kids). You have to fend for yourself for food and drink at the snack bar, and the snack bar closes at 4. Of the 4 water slides, only one is good for older kids, and for all of them, any kid younger than 7 will be sent back if they are not wearing a life jacket (but they don’t provide these required life jackets anywhere I could see at the pool). They actually have a height sign that indicated that my 9 year old would need a life jacket (based on her height) even though she is a great swimmer. As for the room— it was fine, but the morning we were leaving the maid pounded on the door at 7:45 and then actually opened the door to do a “room check.” Then, when we were at breakfast she just went ahead and made our room for the next guests (just moved our stuff to side). Overall, there are nicer beaches elsewhere on Oahu. And you can enjoy the fun parts of Waikiki in a morning or afternoon/evening stroll around the town and beach. ","November 22, 2018"

"BE AWARE!!! This hotel is a complete rip off. My husband and I just stayed here for 5 nights and the experience was extremely average given how much we paid. The customer service was appalling from the moment we arrived. Knowing that check in is not until 3pm, I had requested an early check in at the time of booking (7 months ago!) I never heard back from them. After booking our holiday we were thrilled to find out I was pregnant! So, given that I was now going to be 28 weeks pregnant by the time our holiday rolled around, I emailed them again to follow up this request a few weeks before we left as we were very willing to Ipay. Again, I heard nothing back. So we arrive at the hotel at 6.30am after now being awake for 23 hours having travelled and not been able to get any sleep on our 10 hour flight. I ask about the early check in. The lady says, “Nope, it’s pending availability and nothing is available. Maybe try asking again later”. She did not care at all that we were exhausted or that I was pregnant. She was just looking to push us through so she could serve the next person. We were pushed to the side with no where to go and no help. I burst into tears because I was exhausted and this meant we were going to have to wait around for 8 HOURS before we could lie down on a bed. They did nothing to assist us at all. We had to wheel our luggage to a seperate area to get clothes out so we could get changed and then had no choice but to lie on a pool lounge to try and sleep. Super uncomfortable for a 7 months pregnant person obviously! I also noticed another couple who had arrived off a flight at the same time as us, they had about a 6 month old baby and a toddler and were also told to wait until 3pm. I don’t know how a hotel can do this to people who are willing to pay to check in early off long flights!? By about 12pm my husband had had enough so he went and asked again if we could please check in early. This time we were told “Oh, yeah sure... your rooms actually ready.. that’ll be $50 dollars thank you”. You have got to be kidding me. $50 dollar because BY CHANCE we came and asked again. $50, but our room was just sitting there, unused anyway!? After the terrible service I can’t believe they charged us more money. Other things to be wary of - Friday night fireworks are great. But the place is so packed with people from all over Waikiki that there is a queue at every restaurant, just be mindful of that and there are just people everywhere. It’s already pretty crowded on a normal day! $40 “fees and services” charge per day on top of what you’ve already paid. This is completely ridiculous. We used none of the stuff included in this (PlayStation in your room, a free movie rental from the DVD kiosk and some other little things they’ve tried to think of) except the wifi which was advertised as being free when we booked on trip advisor. We felt completely conned by this, but had no choice but to pay it upon check out.Service at the pool - we asked if we could order something and the waitress Stephanie said, “Oh, you’re actually not in my area sorry, I’ll send Melissa right over for you.” Needless to say, Melissa never came over, she was clearly run off her feet trying to serve people and had guests actually calling out her name (I am assume because Stephanie has told them she was their server). Meanwhile we are sitting there watching Stephanie go up and down and ask the same 5 or so couples in front of us if they were okay and needed anything else, 2-3 times each. But we can’t even get one drink? After about an hour my husband ended up just going and getting us drinks himself. Also if you want to chill on the beach, you’re gonna need to pay $70 for two lounges and an umbrella. Then one of you will have to stay there all day so you don’t lose them. We saw several people in the afternoon taking abandoned lounges rather than paying, so they really don’t police it at all. And $70 a day for lounges and and umbrella, what a rip off! This hotel knows they will continue to attract guests purely based on its facilities and location. It’s a great hotel if you have kids as everything you need is in one resort. It has a good variety of restaurants, a beach and two pools among other things. But they do not give a rats about you or your experience. It is way over crowded and you really do feel like just a number. Having just checked into a similarly priced hotel in Maui, we were blown away with the reception and service we got. Our room wasn’t ready, the lady made phone calls to help us, she gave us lots of information while we waited, she took our bags and our phone number and called us the moment it was ready (30 minutes later). We already feel the difference, this is how an expensive hotel should be! We will never go back to Waikiki village resort and would never recommend it to anyone, it is a total SCAM.","November 20, 2018"
"We decided to spend just two nights in Hawaii after our flight from Fiji was laying over there. We alerted them we’d be in around 2 in the morning so that they could set up a room for us. When we got ther the lady argued with us about the room being set up that they didn’t do it and had us coming in on the following day. So since we were there that early that we’d have to pay $75 to get it despite having an email confirmation that we had complimentary early check in and check out for the correct days. Alas we just paid to get some sleep as we were exhausted. Since the room is wasn’t ready we got a corner room in the rainbow tower when we only booked a regular Mountain View in rainbow tower. Room was beautiful with an amazing view and supposedly Friday’s are a great night to be in that room since there are fireworks. So after that we got some sleep and thought we’d give them another chance tomorrow. The next day we find out that the Hilton honors app needs an update. The app says you get complimentary continental breakfast and when we asked the hotel no one knew why. They all said no it’s just a $10 Per day food credit. Finally we found someone semi knowledgeable that told us that the continental breakfast is from Starbucks basically you tell Starbucks you want it and it should only come out to $10 for some coffee and bagel, real continental breakfast haha. The resort only gives 2 bottles of water for your entire stay, which to me is unheard of but then again the water isn’t overpriced. When speaking with Ryan about late check out it wasn’t very accommodating compared to places we’ve been. He eventually budged from 1 to 1:30, yet it was still insane trying to enjoy the last day at the beach packing up the room and still needing to shower before 5pm dinner (as our flight is at 10:30 tonight, yes I’m sitting in the airport writing this review). Luckily they had a hospitality room that was free so we were able to shower. While speaking to Ryan about late check out he made me feel as because we had the corner room he wouldn’t let us stay any later because they already gave us a “better room than we’re suppose to get.” So with that being said don’t book a regular rainbow tower room and expect a corner. While speaking to Ryan i learned that truly don’t do upgrades they just give you the best available room of the room you booked. As a Diamond member I was extremely disappointed with the treatment at this hotel. They treat you as another number in their long list, you’re nothing special to them. I would truly never want to interact with any of the staff again (besides the lady at the mail and key desk for the hospitality room). Despite the beautiful location along Waikiki, beautiful rooms, and beautiful village with good food I think I would definitely steer clear of this hotel if I were to ever come back. I truly wish I had felt some kindness from the staff there, truly only one member was nice that we spoke, which is outrageous. I wish my review was different and I hope others experience better but this is what it is.","November 19, 2018"
"Paid extra for the Ali’i Tower, as we sit at the pool listening to jack hammers. The hot tub is closed too. When we checked in, they switched my reservation from a king to two double beds. Now I know why, those rooms are under construction. I booked through Delta Vacations and they even called the hotel to ask if the hotel was under construction. The front desk told them no construction at this time. I’m very sad and disappointed to pay all this money and come all this way for the noise. ","November 19, 2018"
Had a great view of the ocean and diamond head. We had a double bed room and was spacious and well maintained. The water is pristine and the lagoon is refilled every morning. Awesome fireworks on Friday nights. The food in the restaurants are plentiful and tasty and service is very good. ,"November 18, 2018"
"I work for Hilton, and booked a room using my employee benefits. I'm never one to complain especially because I was using my Hilton employee rate, but a week later, and I'm still upset with my experience there. Coming from another Hilton property that provides excellent guest service, I was shocked at how poorly I was treated.I feel like I was treated poorly because I was staying on an employee rate. Or maybe it was because I look ""local"". Almost everyone was very rude and short. No aloha whatsoever. The only pleasant interaction was with our hostess at the breakfast buffet. She greeted us with a smile and was so welcoming. We checked in late and the Front Desk agent rushed me through the whole check-in. There was only one couple behind me and there were other agents there to assist. I kindly asked the Front Desk agent for tips about the property, and he seemed so irritated that I asked. I then asked what tower we'd be in and he said right there behind you, the Tapa tower. Very short. Pretty rude like he couldn't be bothered. $50/day valet is pretty crazy, but I decided to do valet anyway because I'm unfamiliar with the grounds and it was only $7 more than $43 self parking. On our second day, we patiently waited over 25 minutes for my car, understanding that they're busy. The valet then brought us the wrong car, and after that we then had to wait another 15 minutes or so for them to find the right car. I asked for a partial credit towards my valet fee for the inconvenience and they just laughed and said no sorry ma'am we can't do that. I'm used to receiving much better treatment than I experienced here. It's a shame because even my colleagues are now telling me that it's the norm for the service to be poor when they stay there. It's a great property but maybe everyone here is too stressed out to care.","November 18, 2018"
"The Hawaiian Village is a BIG hotel on Waikiki Beach. It has its own lagoon, is centrally located, within walking distances of many attractions and restaurants, has several pools and a variety of eateries on the grounds.There are five ""towers"" which could be called separate hotel buildings surrounded by many shops and restaurants, some more expensive than others. Some of the lobbies have live music or bars or areas to sit and relax.I arrived early in the morning from Kauai and purchased an early arrival for our room. I think it cost an extra $150. Normal check in is around 3:00. Glad I got the room early inasmuch as we wanted to change, grab some breakfast and hit the beach. So, the room was needed! Recommendation: check out Goofy Cafe and Dine just around the corner of the hotel for a great breakfast or lunch!Accommodations are large and clean. Prices are a bit higher at the Hawaiian Village than, say, at the Outrigger Hotels. With that, you get a little more.Staff is friendly and accommodating.Pools tend to be busy and there are quite a few kids at the lagoon. We opted for the beach, instead, which, compared to the beaches at Waikiki, were a little sterile, but, with good views.The hotel lobby is lively but the rooms are quiet. Excellent sleeping!","November 18, 2018"
We had 8 wonderful nights at this beautiful hotel. We really couldn’t fault our visit and any query we had was happily answered and attended to promptly. Amazing memories to take home. We will definitely be returning.,"November 17, 2018"
"I had what I felt was a very bad check-in and initial experience. I was quite irate and annoyed, which is no way to start a vacation. However, management was extremely responsive and made me feel heard and that I mattered. In a very large complex like this, that is not an easy task for them. Things happen at any hotel, but how management deals with issues speaks volumes. I am heading to the pier for a 7 day cruise right now, returning to this hotel for another 2 night stay. I’ll update this review with a full rundown based on my “experience 2.0” with my second stay. 11/15/2018 check in for rainbow tower room 326.","November 17, 2018"
"The Hawaiian Village is everything you could ask for! I recommend the Ali’i Tower: 1. Private check in 2. Private Pool3. Great air conditioning 4. Close to beach ( 2 min walk )5. Clean and super friendly staff Special shout out to Chris at front desk, she greeted us everyday with a smile and great attitude. She had our names down after first day! Waikiki is busy however not to crowded as some reviews said. I think it depends when you come down. We’re from the Midwest USA so November was perfect. If your surfing call Sunset Suzys Surf School! North shore is the way to go.Have to go to Lapperts Ice cream!Thank you Hilton Hawaiian Village for the best vacation ever! Maholo","November 17, 2018"
"Nice large.clean resort. High resort fee did not include parking, chairs, umbrellas, water sports, ect.. Parking was an additional $43.00 a day. FYI much cheaper parking garage across the street. It felt like the resort nickels and dimes you for every amenity except towels. Furthermore, our backpack was stolen off the beach directly in front of their resort containing our cellphone, wallet ect. The resort would not review cameras or help investigate the theft in any way citing liability concerns because the beach was public property. Professionals warn that this type theft is on the rise in Hawaii and thieves are targeting these resorts. This resort fails in its due diligence to prevent this type of crime on or near their property. ...And the icing on the cake is that we highly suspect bed bugs as we experienced bites in 2 separate rooms in the Tapa tower when we woke in the morning.","November 17, 2018"
We arrived from our 10hr flight exhausted with no sleep at 7.30am. We were immediately upgraded from a resort view room to a full ocean view in the Kalia tower for the price of the partial ocean view room and the early check in fee waivered. We were so pleased with the wonderful service from the concierge. Please see our pics for our beautiful view. Perfect for viewing the Friday night fireworks from our lanai and the starlight luau. The room was clean & spacious accomodating our family of 2 adults and 1 child. The housekeeping was excellent. We loved the pools and made use of all the pools throughout HHV daily. Our fave pool was on level 4 in the Kalia tower complete with a spa. We enjoyed the lei making & ukulele lessons activities provided by HHV. We enjoyed the many bars & restaurants at HHV. We liked the variety of the ABC stores located on the property. The Atlantis Submarine was very memorable. The pink trolley was nearby for a ride to Ala Moana shopping centre & Waikiki for $2 pp one way. We would like to suggest wrist bands or locked gates for pool access such as the pool with water slides at the Rainbow tower. We highly recommend staying at the HHV. We can’t wait to come back.,"November 16, 2018"
"My partner and I chose the Hilton Hawaiian village to end our big vacation in the US and thought it was going to be a nice and relaxing hotel. Well it turned out to be the complete opposite, the hotel staff are very rude and service is slow. We checked in smoothly but when we got to our room we discover it’s only a partial ocean view and it’s a room with 2 double beds and we wanted a king bed. So we go back down to the desk to ask if we can change rooms, the man Jason at the desk was very rude and didn’t seem bothered about our request but instead he went on a long rant about how they’re very busy and they’re full with lots of families as they’re a “family resort” so all he could do is put in our request for the next day and no chance of an upgrade or anything for the inconvience. So we weren’t able to get the king room until the next day which was annoying but fine.The next day we get to the new room hoping it would be a lot better, however only a slight upgrade. The room wallpaper is very dated and starting to peel off, the bathroom is very small, the sheets on the bed had little tears, poor lighting. There was loud music on Thursday night from the beach area until about 11pm and for a “family resort” thought that it would’ve been finished earlier. The room doesn’t come with the usual amenities that other hotels come with eg: water, info about the area or dining options.The resort itself is a very large complex and very busy, heaps of children running and screaming around the place. The pool areas are very average they’re not that big and they don’t have an adults only section. Also the man made lagoon that was hyped up to us was very disappointing.The photos online make it look a lot nicer than it actually is. For reference we stayed in the Tapa tower.Overall I wouldn’t come back to this hotel and wouldn’t recommend it to couples without kids (or anyone for that matter). If you’re wanting something better in Waikiki I would recommend the Hyatt Centric which is more Central Waikiki. Unfortunately the Hilton village was a disappointing end to a fantastic holiday.","November 16, 2018"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village is tired and in need of a bit of an upgrade. When checking in we were advised that our room contained two queen beds. The beds however were only 54 inch (double beds). Our room was next to the service elevator, we we could hear rattling up and down all night. This hotel is a long way from the better parts of Waikiki beach. ","November 16, 2018"
"My wife and I just returned from 2 weeks at the Hilton. We opted for the Ali'i Tower for our stay. This is the highest priced building with its own pool, hot tub, spa and workout room. We stayed in this tower 2 years ago; this was our second visit. We like having the private pool area although the pool attendant was much more ""attentive"" when we stayed 2 years ago. The pool is definitely showing 2 additional years of wear and tear. It could use a little refresher, but it's still quite nice. The hot tub was closed for repair for the entire 2 weeks. No one was ever working on it, and it looked like it had been closed for weeks/months.You can't beat the location of the hotel. It's the best spot on Waikiki beach. Driving in and out of Waikiki from this location is also fairly easy. Be prepared for a stiff parking charge of $43 per day. This is on top of the resort fee of $35 per day.None of this would prevent us from staying there again. It's still a great hotel in a great location.","November 15, 2018"
"You do not have to stay at a fancy 5 star hotel to enjoy Hawaii. We are a family of 6 and loved our stay at the Hilton. Yummy breakfast with a variety of options. With its own private beach, you can always find space and it is seldom overcrowded. We used a lot of the in-house activities such as surfing. Our two rooms were clean, spacious and fully equipped. We attended the Hilton Luau and had a BLAST. Everything you are imagining is real; flower necklaces, tattoos, dancing... We truly felt like we were able to explore the culture. Recommended!!","November 15, 2018"
"Been waiting half an hour after a delayed flight got here at midnight, Diamond member but they don’t enforce the Hilton honors line either, bank of desks but only two staff working.Kids obviously upset having to wait that long to check in even though we checked in digitally already. It a bit of a joke.","November 15, 2018"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our week long stay(11/3 - 11/10) at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We stayed in Diamond Head Tower. Great ocean view. Enjoyed sitting on the balcony looking at the ocean. I would highly recommend this hotel. So much to do and so many dining options. Beautiful location, large stretch of beach, wonderful pools. People were very helpful and very friendly. Very very happy we picked this hotel for our first visit to Hawaii.","November 14, 2018"
"The hotel is an icon and offers a bit for everyone. We had two different rooms during our stay so that we could enjoy an ocean view for a portion. I cannot emphasize how awesome an ocean view from the Diamond Head side of the Rainbow tower is. We spent a large amount of time on the balcony and it absolutely made our stay amazing. Plenty of ABC stores right on property.Some cons we experienced were: - The bathrooms are a bit small- Parking is expensive (but this is the case in all area hotels)- No coffee before 5:30am, except for the small 2 cup - 1 serving machine in the room- No microwaves in the room, and some rooms have very small fridges- Loud dings from the elevators, so get a room far away","November 13, 2018"
Tapa Tower elevators did not work. Waited 45 minutes more than once. Place is large and crowded so if you want to relax go to the Marriott on the other end of Waikiki. The pools are very cold as well and the hot tubs Luke warm,"November 12, 2018"
"We really enjoyed out stay at Hilton's Hawaiian Village. The rooms were nice and offered some amazing views (waking up to a sunrise over Diamond Head and a view of Waikiki Beach was a great way to start the morning). The overall complex is huge and offered many options for dining, swimming, etc.. For Hilton Honors members, they were offering free continental breakfast voucher, which we found to be more than adequate to start our day.","November 12, 2018"
"We got upgraded to the Rainbow Tower for free (yay!). We just had to ask at the front desk and the guy was very accommodating. Room was fairly larger than what I expected. Elevator was cool - there's a console where everyone presses what floor and it directs you to what elevator to take. With the amount of people staying there, we hardly waited for the elevator. Great job, hotel! FOOD We enjoyed the buffet breakfast every day. So many items to choose from and me, being Asian, they had rice congee and fried rice everyday so my family really enjoyed the food. BEACH Beach is ok - can get crowded on certain times though and since it's a public beach, so many people walk in the path.Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. Service is also really good at the restaurants. It's more for families, definitely not a place for couple looking for a romantic and private resort.","November 12, 2018"
"The hotel and grounds are fantastic, the location is perfect to the beach and close to everything in town, and the ""village"" has a variety of restaurants, pools and everything you need for your entire stay!! I have stayed here several times, and it's been great every time!! ","November 12, 2018"
"The nice thing about this place is that it's huge and has a lot to offer. The drawback is that it's huge and has a lot to offer. The hotel truly is a village onto itself. The hotel room itself was great. There are a lot of shops and restaurants--from lite fare to snacks to haute cuisine. The pools and beach areas are nice. But these areas, and the grounds in general, tend to be crowded...including a lot of families and young children. Going from from one place to another may involve more walking than some people would want to do. Also, the wait to check in was endless. We're not sorry we stayed here. Overall, it was a good experience. But next time, we think we are going to downsize and simplify a bit. Waikiki itself tends to be pretty bustling with activity, but other hotels in the area are a bit more laid back.","November 12, 2018"
"This property is huge. We stayed at the Ali'i building near the beach. Felt it was an ideal location. Takes a little while to find your way around the resort. The beach is nice but they charge $86 to rent 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella. So if you are young a can sit on your towels, go to the beach. Otherwise the pool might be a better option. The grounds are beautiful and the staff is extremely helpful. We stayed for 3 days before going on a cruise. If I had to do it all over again I would have stayed longer to take advantage of the resort itself. We were gone most of the day on tours and did not take advantage of most of the amenities. The fireworks display on Friday night was a nice treat. I have no complaints other than it is very expensive to eat and drink, but that is Waikiki! You can get better prices eating off property.","November 12, 2018"
"Great location, view, and buffet breakfast. Stayed for our anniversary and had a gorgeous oceanfront view and private pool for the tower. Self parking was convenient and thought it was a good price for the views and spacious room. This tower has it's own lobby area and front desk though we checked in at the front. Friendly front desk staff.Took advantage of a spa special for a couple's massage. Very relaxing. Only difficulty were the pillows seemed so small and flat.","November 11, 2018"
"So so experience at the Hilton, very family oriented - mature adults without kids can’t find a kid free area to relax. No adults only pool available. The property is very densely populated - people everywhere - get ready to queue for everything. Almost 4000 rooms/vacation units. Oh my goodness, the waits for the elevator were crazy - up to 20 minutes during peak times. Everything was so crowded. Definitely not a luxury hotel experience. $50/day for valet parking...self park is $43.We were in tapa tower which has live music every night. The music was good, but quite loud and we were not expecting it every night. Forget about leaving the windows open and falling asleep to the soothing ocean waves.On a positive note, liked the hair amenities...smelled great! Also, loved the Friday night fireworks show!!We got a good package deal on the room and had low expectations so we were satisfied enough with our stay. However, would not stay here again. ","November 11, 2018"
Lovely clean hotel. My room was very spacious & had really nice bathroom toiletries! Plenty of food & shopping options & everything I needed was on site. Friday night fireworks were lovely. A lovely location.,"November 11, 2018"
"We had 2 wonderful nights in the Rainbow Tower. We had paid for a corner Diamond Head room and the view was spectacular from the 2 balconies. The room was clean and comfortable, as mentioned by others it is showing signs of wear and tear. We had paid the $50 for the early check in but only got in the room 1 hour before regular check in so definitely not worth it. I was doing the Waikiki Roughwater swim so fantastic to finish on the beach and go to your room for a shower.","November 11, 2018"
"At no fault to the hotel, our cab driver dumped us off about a block from the entrance and we had to walk. It was over 90 degrees and the hike to the check in is down a very long driveway. Once there, we were unable to get a requested early check-in, as they were fully booked the evening before. They gave us a pager and we went to Tropics for breakfast. The food was awesome, but we had to fight off the birds (and their droppings) the entire time. I would suggest eating inside. It was pricey ($60 for just us two). After about a 2 hour wait, we received a page that our room was ready. You pick up your keys at a different desk that where we checked in, then another desk to retrieve our HHonors water. Then, the hike to the Tapa tower (whew!). Room was HUGE, but very, very dated and worn. Our partial ocean view was mostly rooftop, but not too bad. Dinner was at Bali Steak & Seafood. Fabulous service, great food, above average wine list and PRICEY! I think we spent ~$400 for our meal. Afterwards, it was a very long walk back to the tower. Overall, the resort offers everything you can imagine, but you have to put up with crowds and lines, and the outrageous food & drink prices.","November 11, 2018"
"The resort is beautiful with so much to do. Plenty of restuarants and shops. The pools are beautiful—get your seats early if you can. Within walking distance to other great shops and restaurants. A great place if you are looking for a fun, lively, beautiful stay in Waikiki","November 11, 2018"
This looks place offers all you could want and more . Room was lovely bedding dreamy . A walk to Ala Moana shopping centre . A stroll to Waikiki beach . Access to all transport and tours . All the restaurants in the resort that I accessed were of high quality ,"November 11, 2018"
"Amazing resort for young, old, families and honeymooners. Bars, restaurants, beach, pools, shops, book tours and close to everything. Staff are great. It’s so safe. Close to everything. Resort fee is definitely worth it. It seems expensive but there is happy hour, bar snacks, shops for snacks etc. plenty of places to eat. Free entertainment every night, fireworks, lovely coffee shops. It’s got everything.","November 11, 2018"
"I booked a room with a partial ocean view in the Alii tower. Upon check-in, I was told that I was going to be put on the third floor. I asked if there was a room higher up, my Hilton Honors profile has one request – a high floor. I was told that they could put me on the 5th floor but with two beds instead of one. I opted for the room with a king bed. When I got to the room, I was surprised that they were actually selling this room as a partial ocean view, I could see the trees next door, I would call the shimmers of blue coming through the trees as a partial view of the ocean.Although the room felt dated and somewhat worn, the room was spacious with a large closet and bathroom area. At no point did I find myself thinking, I wish there was more counter space or my places to put my clothing. The room was clean and the housekeeper didn’t forget to refresh any of the amenities. The following morning, I awoke to what I thought was the sound of an alarm clock. I realized that it wasn’t an alarm clock, it was the sound of a truck backing up. I wasn’t sure what time it was but it was still dark. I go back to bed and a few minutes later, I hear it again. My room was directly above the loading dock and there were daily delivers that started as early as 4AM and continued throughout the morning and replaced later in the day by tour buses. I found myself looking forward to going home so that I could get a full night’s sleep. On Saturday night, I though there may not be deliveries on Sunday, or there might be less. There were delivery trucks and if that hadn’t been bad enough, my phone rang at 6:30 AM. I couldn’t get to the phone in time but I listened to the voice mail. It was the Ali’I tower front desk. I couldn’t make heads or tails out of the message, it said that they weren’t sure what day it was but they wanted to confirm that I was checking out on Monday. Not sure what that was about, I called the Ali’I Front Desk, nobody answered, I told them my room number and let them know my plans had no changed.I went back to sleep and at 8:00 AM, someone started to ring my doorbell. It was the All’I front desk, and the person ignored my do not disturb sign. I am again asked, was I still planning on checking out on Monday? I tell her that I am not pleased about the room and the loading dock beneath it, I tell her that I do not appreciate being called at 6:30 in morning and then having someone come to my room, ignoring the Do Not Disturb sign. She asks me what she can do to make this right. Was I being asked by the very person who was creating the nightmare on what it was they could to make this right? I said for starters let me go back to bed.Later that morning I asked about the incident and they said someone dropped off keys and they thought they had said, my room number and when they went to check me out realized that I wasn’t due to check out until Monday. I was told that they could move me to a room on a higher floor and I said, I am not going to pack everything up and move for one night. Needless to say, I don’t see myself staying there again.","November 10, 2018"
"Great location. Huge property. There is mall here within the hotel. Great beach access, a lagoon and several pools. Very attentive staff. Lots of options. For those who like shopping there is a Louis Vuitton here. 2 Starbucks, etc. fireworks on Friday night, plenty of happy hours and restaurants. I give it a 4 star because your tower was dated and beaten up a bit. Definitely needs refreshing, other than that. It’s been great. ","November 10, 2018"
"The hotel was 15 minutes from the airport and very convenient for our overnight stay on route to Japan. We had an ocean view in the Rainbow tower. Cleans, comfy bed, easy check in even tho busy. Great shower. Lovely staff. Great view. ","November 10, 2018"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki is a family favorite! My husband and I have stayed at this property before and this year we took the family! It is in a great location within walking distance to anything you could possibly need, the pools are great for kids of all ages (our boys are 11 and 16). We alternated between beach, pool and a handful of excursions. Lapperts Ice cream within the village a must! If you enjoy working out, the fitness center was remodeled and has spin bikes (not quite a Peloton but I was able to use them with the Peloton APP. BONUS!). Not to mention plenty of gorgeous view if you want to run outside. If you are looking for a great property for couples or for your family, this would be our number 1 recommendations. PS - CJ's in the village is a great dinner/lunch/breakfast spot with great meals and reasonable prices!","November 9, 2018"
Stayed in the Kahlia tower. Great view of the ocean and the fireworks on the Friday night. Loved how pool in the same building and could get towels for the pools when needed. Lots of pools. Lots to do. Close to buses. Within walking distance to malls or just catch the bus. Rooms serviced daily. We will be back.,"November 8, 2018"
The hotel is right there in the water and great. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Things are rather pricey but you pay for the beauty. Shops all around and can buy almost anything. Bars are great and people again are amazing. You can here live entertainment every night. Traveling around is easy and can get Uber to go places as limited parking,"November 8, 2018"
"We stayed in the rainbow tower with amazing views but the room was nothing to be excited about. It is very plain and our TV was not working when we arrived. The place is ""clean"" but very old and was not up to par. It was also extremely busy and the line to check in was ridiculous, I felt bad every night seeing how long the line was to check in. It seemed to be like that all hours of the day. The hotel doesn't go above or beyond on anything, very average. We went for our honeymoon and didn't receive any additional service. Pools seemed dirty from all the people that were going in. We just tried to enjoy the views from the balcony and the beach.","November 8, 2018"
"To start this was a business trip, but HHV made it very enjoyable. Right on Waikiki beach, and next to Fort DeRussi park. Awesome location. All the amenities you would expect from a Hilton property and then some. The HHV is it’s own shopping area, with several restaurants as well. The specialty restaurants are away from the beach, while the beachside ones attract customers on location and views. Mai Tai’s at sunset is hard to beat. Great staff, great rooms, gear stay.","November 8, 2018"
"(I try not to leave bad reviews, but this is just too many HIDDEN fees to not warn people) Do your research before you stay here. I booked this hotel for my parents and feel horrible to say the least! We are all honor members, it took about 45min to get checked in that is not the bad part...... If you didnt want to stay in a room with MOLD they offer you a room in the renovated part of the motel for an extra 100.00 a night! My mom is allergic to mold, when they told them that they offered her the room for 55.00 a night, they also MADE them pay a 40.00 a night wifi fee even though they said they didnt need it, not to mention the 40.00 a night resort fee(which we knew about). So now they are looking at close to 400.00 a night + tax! I would have picked a WAAAAAYY nicer resort for 400.00 a night. Needless to say I am done with Hilton and will make sure to let our agent know and time share.. We have canceled our return stay in December.","November 7, 2018"
"We recently just got back from our 8 day trip to Honolulu and decided to stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village Oct 24-Nov 1. Let me start by saying this is absolutely one of the nicest hotel we stayed at. We normally stay at Sheraton but it was all booked. So we decided to give Hilton a try since we were traveling with families that has little ones. We thought the pools with the slides would be a plus for the kids, This hotel is very big and very crowded!!! We arrived on wednesday at 11 am. We waited in this long long check in line that looked like it would never end only to be told that we couldn't check in til 3pm unless we are willing to pay $50 for early check in. We just landed from a long flight and all we wanted to do was shower. After waiting in line for about 45 mins we decided to pay the extra fee to check in early or else we would have to come back at 3pm and wait in that ridiculously line again. It just seemed like a total nightmare. The room we got was nothing to special looks like all the other hotels.The pool here is beautiful but it was really hard to get the chairs. We decided to spend most of our time at the beach. We had to pay $32 for umbrella and $18 for 2 lounge chairs. Seem pretty steep. On our second to last day of our trip we went to the parking garage in front of round table pizza to get our car when all of a sudden a piece of the roof decided to come crashing down! Luckily it missed us by half and inch! My heart was pounding so fast i had to sit down to let what had just happen sink in! A lot of the people came running in to check if i was ok. They were nice enough to call and employee for me so i can file a report. They called over the security who came and made a report but didn't seem to be very concern in what had just happen. He just asked if i was hurt and if i needed medical attention. I told him i wanted to file a report to make sure management clear and rope off the section so know other guest can get hurt. He seem to be bothered and didn't care as much. He was able to take down my information and a witness that saw what had happen. He didn't seem to be very apologetic about it. What happen if it landed on my head instead of the floor?? Luckily i was wearing a hat that day and probably all the debris had bounced off my hat.Overall the hotel is nice but for the price that we pay nightly we might not return.It's a little bit of a walking to get to the main strip of Kalakaua .We come to Hawaii twice a year and i have to say this is one of the trip where you'll always remember not in a good way.IF you are looking for a crowded hotel with all the hustle and bustle and long lines for check in and coffee this is the hotel for you!","November 7, 2018"
"Best hotel on the beach. Best to stay in the Rainbow Tower with the beach front view- you are right on the beach with a beautiful scenic view all the way down to Diamond Head. This resort has absolutely everything! A great lagoon, esp good for small children. The beach here is very wide and waters are calm. The resort has many shops, so just about anything you may need is right here. This is a very busy resort, with many people coming and going all the time - but the customer service is amazingly good. Staff are the friendliest imaginable. The rooms are very clean, large quiet and the beds comfortable.","November 7, 2018"
"Finally returning to Hawaii after 21 years, and I chose Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort, as I wanted the best for my family. I got it right, this hotel is absolutely awesome in every way, it is colossal, it is beautiful,it is on Waikiki Beach, it has everything. Staff are exceptional in every way and the whole hotel runs like a smooth machine that's been tried and tested for many years. We had a brilliant holiday and full marks to this hotel for accommodating us to perfection.Thank you everyone on board,you made a dream come true.","November 6, 2018"
Booked a resort view room very dissatisfied with room allocated in the Diamond Tower small old and dark! Overlooking a roof top !For those prices I expos lot more. I did complain and st first was asked to pay USD $63 to upgrade to sea view when I declined I was then offered a room in the Tapa Tower at no extra cost which was roomy light and airy still a resort view not overlooking pool area and partial sea view. Rooms extremely clean. Resort it’s self was amazing heaps of pools fresh towels for the beach and pool. The only thing if you have kids hire of water sports equipment very over priced!,"November 6, 2018"
"The hotel itself is gorgeous. There are so many options for food and shopping. Most of the staff is friendly. The beach is beautiful and the lagoon is very relaxing. My only complaints are:1. Lack of adult only pool. We spent very little time in the pool because the amount of kids is overwhelming. 2. Housekeeping was drastically lacking. We had room service leftovers sitting in our room for 3 days before we finally left the housekeeper a note asking her to take them. The garbage cans are so tiny and strangely shaped that it’s not like we could have thrown it all in the garbage to be taken. 3. The walls are so thin. All I heard, all night long, is toilets flushing. I could also hear kids screaming in the rooms around me. I’ve never heard so much noise from other rooms in any other hotel I’ve stayed in. ","November 6, 2018"
"Arriving early and being dropped off at a location with a distance to walk was inconvenient. Using Speedie Shuttle service is the only bus that's drops you off at the main reception and picks you up at the same spot on departure which is recommended by us. Hospitality by staff was very good, the room we stayed in was clean and the furniture dated. The bathroom had a shower over the bathtub which was not suitable for us so we were moved to a room with a ""roll in shower"" (suitable for a wheelchair). Be aware the toiletries being replaced everyday did not include body wash so take your own. The meals at the restaurants were very good but on the expensive side as the US$ was very low. The nightly entertainment was excellent, you could sit back enjoy a wine and listen to wonderful singing, and the odd patron getting up and doing a dance routine. The hotel is in easy walking distance from the bus stops, laundramat 711 stores and ABC stores which charge $6?? for 1 litre milk and $7?? for a box of cornflakes so take plenty of money with you. The boat trips we did were great, being out on the water soaking up the sun was relaxing.There is a street market uptown Waikiki once a month It has great, food stalls, jewellery etc. The International Market Place is still just a lane with many stalls, all selling the same stuff.We have been to Hawaii 3 times now and this is the last trip.Watch out for muggers and we were at a bus stop when a lady was knocked over and robbed of her phone. The offender was on a pushbike for easy get away. ","November 6, 2018"
Had a great time at the HHV. Definitely will be back and they are very friendly and helpful. Stayed in the Lagoon tower and the only thing I would say negative about this is sometimes you have to wait for the elevators.,"November 6, 2018"
"Stayed here for 8 nights and overall we really enjoyed our stay. It certainly could use improvement but for what it's worth we'll probably stay again. Here's the good:- Proximity to beach is great!- Resort has amazing pools for kids and families. Hot tubs close early and they don't allow floaties in the pool but the ocean is a short walk away and it's warmer than the pool! So, you can use your floatie there. - Tons to do - shopping, food, entertainment. It's never boring- Great staff overall. Had some bad ones but the overwhelming majority of the staff were very helpful and accommodating. - Towel service. Nice to not worry about towels. We took ours to the varying beach trips we took and just returned them each night. - Nightly music at multiple restaurants / barsHere's the bad:- Older rooms. We got upgraded to the Rainbow Tower for free because raw sewage kept backing up into our bathtub. Disgusting for sure! The Rainbow Tower is much newer and nicer but I'm not sure I'd pay the $50 per night upgrade fee. If you're the type of person who spends a lot of time in their room I'd probably suggest paying for the upgrade. - Ridiculously expensive parking! $43-50+ per day is outrageous! We parked consistently on the street for free. Took some walking at times but worth saving hundreds of dollars!- Expensive food. Everything is expensive on the resort so plan ahead. A medium pizza (a very small medium by the way) is $27 dollars. Drinks are normal resort pricing. - A bit far from the rest of Waikiki. It's a bit of a hike to the main part of Waikiki. This can also be a blessing as it gets really crowded down there. Just be ready to walk or take cabs if you don't have a rental car. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here! It has room for improvement but we'd definitely stay here again - especially while we have young kids.","November 6, 2018"
"I stayed at this resort over 10 years ago and I remember enjoying it very much. Apparently, over the past 10 years they’ve stopped trying.Majority of the staff were unpleasant, and we found roaches in our room.The lines for front desk are long and the resort fee is high. I would recommend the Hyatt Regency further down the road. Our friends stayed there, and it was quite nice.","November 6, 2018"
"Excellent location, with amazing sunset views.Spacious bedrooms and good a/c.Lots of pools which are child friendly.Check in lines were long but flowed quickly ( a quick tip - join Hilton Honors before arriving and avail of dedicated check in line)The local Hawaiian staff were really friendly but some of the other staff, while efficient, were curt to the point of rudeness.We are planning on returning next year.","November 5, 2018"
Have stayed at this amazing place several times and recently spent 11 nights there to celebrate my 50th. I am a Hilton Gold member and always stay in the Ali’i tower but have never asked for or expected an upgrade at this Hilton because I know how busy they are. So I was amazed on this occasion on check in to find I had been upgraded to a corner oceanfront room - wow thank you Hilton Hawaiian Village - fantastic room and views and it was very very much appreciated.I can’t recommend this place enough - yes some people complain how busy it is but it’s a huge resort with everything you need and hey it’s Waikiki it’s busy everywhere. If you want somewhere quiet go to one of the other islands. Location is great - 10 min walk one way to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre and a 10min walk other way to Kalakaua Ave and the HHV has by far the best stretch of beach right out frontTips: Book Ali’i or Kalia tower - both have their own check in desks in the lobby so you can avoid the main desk and long queues. Ali’i tower also have their own pool and gym on Level 2 that only guests in that tower can use. I have never had an issue getting a sun lounge here or using the gym in all the times I have visited and the pool on Level 4 in Kalia tower is usually quieter too. Cheesecake Factory - If you go there for dinner expect a wait of 1-2 hours for a table. Instead go for lunch or brunch (Sat/Sun). Minimal wait for a table (often no wait) or for dinner order takeout which is very quick. ABC stores - both stores in the village are very well stocked however about 2 blocks away on Ala Moana Ave their is an ABC Superette which has a huge range. Starbucks - have great lunch packs which are good for pool or beach however buy them at an offsite Starbucks store where they are $6-$7. The identical lunch packs at the onsite Starbuck stores are almost double that at $11-$12.Thanks HHV I’ll be back next year.,"November 5, 2018"
I’m not a fan of complexes but it served as a quick 3 day stopover on our US. tour. I never swim in the sea so like a nice pool instead. But the pools here were crowded out with kids and no adult only pool on site. Sunbeds are scarce and no umbrellas at all. A bad point that and think it’s the only place I’ve been to without them. There’re also small- pools so maybe they expect you to swim in the sea instead. You hire umbrellas and beds there. The lagoon is ok for a paddle but I wasn’t happy with the fish in it as well. Food is ok and a supermarket on site so you can buy your own meals if you want. CJs is just great for omelettes. Well done there and nicely cooked. Wouldn’t wish to return.,"November 5, 2018"
"I stayed here 2 years ago for only 5 days and was eager to come back.I stayed here for two weeks this time and enjoyed it thoroughly. Was upgraded to the corner room with double balcony in the rainbow tower. Check in was a bit slow but efficient was I made it there. Most of the staff is very friendly and wants to actually help you.The room are looking a bit work out though: furniture scratches, dusty air vents, stained carpet. Housekeeping could use some help as well to keep the service consistent.I thought the pool and public areas were well kept, and there are plenty of dinning and snack options to choose from. Best of all, you are just steps away from the beach and their lagoon as well.Will stay here again.","November 5, 2018"
"A horrible burglary case happened during my stay. Somebody broke into my hotel room during day time and stole almost everything from us. The loss includes passports, IDs and personal belongings with more than $10K cash value. The hotel is proactive in neither investing the security defect nor helping the guests. However, they are extremely good at shirking and dumping responsibilities they are supposed to take.Overall, very disappointed. I would recommend those who are considering booking this resort think twice before making a final decision.","November 5, 2018"
"The property is a bit overwhelming. Several towers with rooms in them each with its own pool. A lagoon with the option to rent non-motorized water sports. Good restaurants. It's expensive, but I think everyone knows that going in. Rooms are fine. Not great, but we didn't stay there for the rooms. The beach was very well taken care of and clean. Only bad thing is that because it is so big it will take some time to check in and get a bellman to deliver your bags to your room.","November 5, 2018"
"I booked this hotel for 3 nights paid in full direct to the hotel for a 2 night stay so my room was ready on arrival at 7am, I emailed Hilton advising I will be a late arrival and received an email advising they have forward my email to this hotel with no response after 2 days I phoned the hotel direct from Australia & spoke to a lovely lady in reservations and she advised that should made a note on my booking I will be a late arrival. I arrived to check in at 7am and there Is no booking in my name, so I showed my reservation paperwork and was advised that booking was a “no show” as I explained I emailed and phoned this hotel the unfriendly front desk lady re booked me in and went to charge me again for the 3 nights as I explained I have already paid for the room she advised she amended the booking. On the day of check out I receive an invoice from the hotel with 2 nights charge as I frustratedly went to the front desk to sort the issue a friendly desk staff sorted it all out and even credit me for the 1st night( which I am still waiting for). The hotel is old, I stayed in Rainbow Tower Jnr suite all food and bars in the complex are expensive for what you get.","November 4, 2018"

"As an annual visitor to Honolulu, I've yet to find the right hotel for me. I decided to give HHV a second try after a nice conversation with the GM at an event last year. Unfortunately, I'm still not impressed and will continue looking for a hotel that doesn't forego the happiness of its adult guests for the strollers and screamers crowd. If you don't travel much, you might find this property impressive, but discerning and/or frequent travelers probably won't.I knew to stay in the Ali'i Tower because of the dedicated private desk (to avoid the crazy long check in lines at general check-in) and more updated rooms. It also has a ""private"" pool for Tower guests only on level 2. Unfortunately, despite this being smaller and having a bar there, the hotel REFUSES to make this an adult pool - or even put one on the property at all, even when guests in the Ali'i Tower can walk out the doors and be at the Super Pool in 5 seconds. Thus, every day there were children in the pool yelling, splashing, bringing pool toys, crowding the only set of steps, crying - and I was awakened early some days on my NINTH FLOOR room that overlooked that pool by screaming children down there. At an event this year, I saw the GM of the Grand Vacations, who used to be the GM of the HHV. I mentioned the adult pool situation and he suggested I stay in the Ali'i Tower. I said that I was, and his response was, ""Well there really shouldn't be any children in that pool."" When I told him that just that day there were 13 at once, he looked shocked. When I went to the Spa in the Kalia Tower, there was a very small pool on that level that the current GM had mentioned would probably be the quietest. Well, guess what? There was a family with an infant in the pool. I get that hotels seem to think that families spend more money, but adults buy much more booze, shop, and don't go to the convenience store to bring back food, water, soda, snacks, and everything else to avoid buying anything on-site. It wouldn't kill the hotel to dedicated one pool at the most expensive Tower to the adults. Even though I'd booked five months in advance and am an Hhonors member, there was literally one room available that I'd paid for with a King bed. That one room was on a nice, high floor, but it had connecting doors, and I refuse to be awakened at 4am every day by people who aren't adjusted to the time zone difference yelling in their room. The front desk attendant offered me an ""upgrade"" to an ocean front (instead of ocean view) room with no connecting door, but once again - there were only double beds available. I had to pay an extra $500 for it but went ahead, only to discover that it was two doors down from the elevator. Luckily, other than the screaming kids in the pool at 7am, the construction noise from the pool, and one other day when people were banging around on the connecting wall, it was actually pretty quiet.However, even in the Ali'i Tower, things are showing wear and tear. The dark wood closet doors and hangers are scratched up, there are gouges in the walls, the bathtub/shower floor was peeling, and even though the main showerhead was clean, the handheld sprayer had thick calcium buildup. Bathroom amenities were nice, although no shower gel, and the coffee maker in-room was a Keurig. Unfortunately, that ""upgrade"" to an ocean front room meant that the room got blasting heat every afternoon until sunset, and my room never got below 72, even after I asked housekeeping to keep the curtains closed. The controller won't go below 68, either. Yes, the property is pretty big, and you have two ABC stores, another general store, and many other shops of varying levels of cost and offerings. There are a few restaurants on property, none of which have ever really impressed but are convenient, as well as a Starbucks in between the Ali'i and Diamond Head Tower. I personally don't mind the walk into the main shopping / dining area (about 10 minutes), or about the same if you want to go to Ala Moana Mall, but some may find that inconvenient. However, Uber can get you there for $5.Lastly, I wasn't too happy with checkout. I had booked my room an extra day because I have to redeye back to the mainland and of course late checkout and hospitality rooms aren't guaranteed. When I went to the desk at 2:30, the guy (whose badge said training and the three others standing around didn't even pay attention to how he was doing) never asked me how my stay was, why I was checking out early, or offer to comp that last night since hey - now the hotel can ""upgrade"" somebody else to that hot, double-bed room near the elevator or sell another night. I wouldn't have booked the ""extra"" night if I wasn't willing to pay for it, but his telling me, ""Well you have to pay for it"" when I explained I was checking out a day early to avoid confusion when he looked up my reservation wasn't great customer service.So I'm still looking for the hotel that will provide the best experience in Honolulu. After two tries in my adult life (four total), HHV obviously isn't it.","November 4, 2018"
"Beautiful resort but overpriced. There’s about 5 different hotels on the site. We stayed in Kalia tower with the water view. It was a lovely room and lovely view. The bathroom is small but the amenities are modern. The shampoo and soap are quality. The coffee they supply is very nice but they don’t give you enough. :( The pool towel card thing is confusing. If you lose a card they charge you ten dollars. Their pool towels are just white towels not bigger beach towels as you’d expect. There’s a large variety of shops and dining on the resort premises, some are more reasonably priced than other. None are fine dining though. The resort texts you sometimes with updates on things happening around the place which is nice ! Room attendant was lovely as was the security when I forgot my key in the room one night. Concierge also lovely and front desk can be a bit confusing as they have different tiersOf check in. But perhaps that’s just the USA way, I can’t say as I have only travelled domestic (AUS) past ten years. Parking is excessive. The resort fee is as well. 43 a day or so. Room service ends at 9 or 10 pm rather than being 24/7 which you’d expect from the price of the rooms. ","November 3, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village is amazing. I have stayed there now 4 times but the last time was 21 years ago. It was perfect everytime. My husband and i came while dating about 21 years ago and now for out 20th anniversary. It was perfect yet again. We started with the Hilton honors checkin which had no line. We checked into a great room with a beautiful view. It wasnt beach view this time but beautiful view of property and lush greenery. The beach is right there! Everything is walkable. Many food and drink choices , live music and shopping. Everything was amazing. I did xpress checkout with reciept emailed. Perfection all around. I will try to get my daughter to marry here so we can all come together. We have to start saving money now. Working at a five star hotel in Las Vegas i feel you can go somewhere less expensive but when its perfect here, why go anywhere else.","November 3, 2018"
"Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort Sept 22-29th, 2018. The resort is beautiful. Rooms are spacious and very clean. Our dinner at The Bali Steakhouse was delicious and the service and hospitality from John was memorable. Staff at this resort are so pleasant and always willing to assist with a smile. Housekeepers were so friendly. Location is really great. Close to markets. Visit the Japanese Food court in Ala Moana Mall. The concierge encouraged us to rent a car and venture out to explore the entire island. We are so happy we did. Visited all the gorgeous beaches, Bays, waterfalls, Giovanni's Shrimp Truck (amazing).Can't wait to return to Hawaii! ","November 3, 2018"

Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort has everything you need it is a wonderful place to stay.If you decided to stay here book a room in the Rainbow Towers you will find no other balconies from other hotels looking in yours as It’s placed in front on the beach.If the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort was closer to the town centre you wouldn’t have to catch so many busses.But otherwise there is nothing negative to say about this hotel everything was great.,"November 2, 2018"

"My husband and I along with our grown daughters recently went to the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. It is a beautiful location in a very busy city. Before leaving I knew that the location was a city, but I wasn't prepared for the fact that the hotel is in the heart of Honolulu. With that said, the grounds of the Hilton Hawaiian Village are very beautiful and feel very tropical. There are several large hotel towers (each one with at least 20 to 30 floors) surrounding the resort areas. We enjoyed the larger of the five pools on the grounds. The other smaller pools had many children in them that did not lend themselves to relaxing. In addition to the pools the hotel is on Waikiki Beach. A beautiful stretch of beach that is protected by a break wall making it enjoyable for taking a swim in the ocean. Our room was clean and very comfortable. On the flip side, the hotel charges a $40 a day resort fee. With two rooms for our family and a ten night stay we ended up paying an additional $800 dollars for our stay, This could have been okay if the hotel offered extras for their guest. They do not. We had to pay for beach umbrellas and chairs on the beach, transfers to other locations in Honolulu, and very expensive drinks by the pool. The hotel did have nightly entertainment, but because of our jet lag from NYC we didn't stay up past 9pm many nights. I've stayed at the Hilton in Miami Beach and had many more amenities given to us for less money. All in all I would say this is a nice hotel but you could stay at another hotel on the beach with many more resort amenities for less money.","November 2, 2018"
"Currently sitting at the pool at the Ali Tower, wait staff asked my wife and I if we would like a drink, I said yes and received a drinks menu, waiter came back about 20 minutes later and asked for our order, two champagnes please was what I asked for, another twenty minutes later (after our neighbours had received two lots of drink service)! Waiter comes back and tells me that they don’t have any champagne, really a hotel this size and they have no champagne! First world problem I know but really, get your act together Hilton, not acceptable","November 2, 2018"
"This hotel has about everything you need; lots of food choices, kids program, tons of shopping, easy pick up for tours, etc., fireworks and a nice beach area. Excellent choice especially if new to Hawaii (like my wife and I were). Very quiet in the room. Yes, food and shopping is expensive - so it 99% of Hawaii.","November 2, 2018"
"This place is overly expensive. If you are looking to stay in Waikiki and just need a place to sleep, forget this place. They charge a mandatory daily $40 resort fee. Parking is another $43 dollars a day and that doesnt include valet!You're looking at spending another $600 USD for a week if you have a car. All the bars/restaurants were also overly expensive on this ""resort"". Do yourself a favour and purchase your alcohol from the duty free and save yourself hundreds of dollars in drinks. For food, leave the resort and eat else where. Even the closest McDonalds across the road was over priced compared to all the other McDonalds in Honolulu. Check in was the worst. After travelling for 11 hours to get there, we waited for over an hour to check in. They had 2 people working the counter and 60 people in line. There was another line up for hilton honor members with 4 people in line and 3 people behind the counter. What's the logic behind that?If you are celebrating something special such as a birthday, stay else where. I was asked on 3 different occasions by 3 different staff at the front desk what our occasion was and I mentioned birthday. No note was taken and nothing was done on my special day...not even a balloon in our room. All in all, the hotel is located right on the beach but so are all the other surrounding hotels. Walk that extra 5 minutes to the beach and save yourself hundreds if not, thousands of dollars.","November 2, 2018"
"This is a truly awful resort. It is so sad how far it has fallen in the past 15 years. I've stayed here a number of times - in fact, I'm here right now, but not in the original room assigned to me. That room is infested with bedbugs. I have more than 100 bites. I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 ONLY because they cleaned my clothes. There was no apology, no offer to compensate other than giving me points to cover items that were ruined. They didn't call to see how I was feeling, didn't ask if I needed anything. Oh, did I mention I'm a Lifetime Diamond with Hilton? If this is how they treat me, imagine how they will treat you. Avoid this hotel at all costs. It is run down, the food is awful, management is uncaring, and they have bedbugs. Lots and lots of bed bugs. 2 of their employees told me this is starting to become a regular occurrence, so I have to recommend you consider other properties in Waikiki.","November 1, 2018"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village is the place to stay in Waikiki Beach. You really never have to leave! There are five pools, and a beautiful beach. As a couple we found the pool on the 4th floor of the Kalia Tower to be a good fit, as it is quiet, where the other ""super pools"" are loaded with kids and families. Tons of places to eat on site - but all are very expensive. The staff were all very nice and accommodating. Our view of the ocean and Diamond Head were beautiful. We were not able to confirm a King bedded room, as the majority of the rooms are doubles. Would not hesitate to return. I have been told that this is the busiest Hilton in the World, check-in and check-out lines can be long. We set up our airport transportation and settled our bill the night before checking out so that we would not feel stressed or rushed in the morning.","November 1, 2018"

"Wasted over 5 hours in a 2 and a half day stay. Waited 25 minutes to check in after 11 hour flight. No place to set down. This was well after check in time. Was sent to desk after desk to get very simple answers to simple 10 second questions. This was like a big city where no department knew anything about anything except their own job, not even where to send you for your next 10+ minute wait in line.","October 31, 2018"
"Our stay started on a Wednesday evening until Sunday morning. When we got dropped off, via bus transfer, we were dropped off on the opposite side of the check-in desk. Not very fun to pull luggage on cobble stone. I was very surprised they did not have a bell desk nearby. Check-in line was fairly long but then I realized I was a Hilton Honors member so they had a shorter line. I paid for this room through Costco Travel with a complimentary beachview upgrade, minus resort fees. When we arrived, I was told we are guaranteed an beachview but the view was not that great and in an older tower (Diamond Head). I was talked into an upgrade to stay in a newer tower (Rainbow). I figured that was fine.After being given our keys, we were never asked if we need a bell persons assistance with our luggage. Nor, did the check-in agent provide any details about the resort.Approaching our guest elevators, you have to go to a keypad and type your floor and at that time you are pre-assigned which elevator you are to get into. This became a problem on numerous occasions. We would get assigned an elevator and then there would be no more room to enter and we would have to wait for the next. Then that would fill up and then we had to wait for another.If you are not aware, the hotel offers a firework show on Friday night between 7:30pm-8:00pm. Although, it was raining a little bit, we found a spot on the beach with our towels and enjoyed the 5-10 minute show.Restaurants within the resorts were kind of pricey. We ended up eating at Tropics for two adults and two kids and ended up spending about $130. There is also a nearby shopping center we walked to and had dinner at a place called Blue Water Shrimp. Another pricey location but excellent food. Better than restaurants inside the actual hotel.Best place for coffee and sticky bun every morning was at Lapperts located in the mall across the driveway from the front desk.We did a couple activities through the resort like pedal bike water and paddle boarding. My wife reminded me to bill it back to our hotel room because we get 10% off. Something that was not told to us upon check-in.When we checked out they did not provide the 10% discount. The front desk agent asked how we knew about the discount. It is only advertised in their key packets. Then the agent tells us, an outside company runs the activities and we would have to talk to them. She kept asking me if I told them about the discount. If this is a company you have working within the resort and you are advertising we get a discount if we bill the activities back to our room, why do I have to mention it. The hotel eventually made it right.A few words of advice. ALWAYS carry your room key with you. The bathroom in one of the pool areas was closed and we were told to walk to a nearby tower to use the restroom in the lobby. A key was required to get into the restroom of the lobby. Also, upon check-in, I advise you to provide a cell phone number to add on file. You will receive a welcome text message. This was a good way to communicate to the hotel. Somebody always responded fairly quickly. If you rent a car, expect to pay at least $43 for self-parking overnight and $50 for valet overnight.Overall, we enjoyed our stay but a couple things could have made it a better experience.","October 31, 2018"
"The hotel is very expensive to stay at and I'm not sure if it was really worth the price. For the cost and it being a Hilton hotel it wasn't as well kept as I would have expected. The furniture was all scratched and clearly worn down and our duvet cover had a very obvious hole and stain on it that appeared to be a cigarette burn - not sure why this wasn't noticed when the bed was being made and the cover swapped out for a new, fresh one but we let it go. Upon check in we paid to upgrade to the Lagoon View in the Rainbow Tower and it was nice being right next to the pool and beach. The check in line was not as bad as I have seen in other reviews - we arrived around 3 pm on a Saturday and were checked in within about 20 mins. The resort village (all the restaurants and shops) and the beach, lagoon and main pool are all open to the public so the price to stay at the resort does not really include exclusive access to anything other than a few of the smaller pools (the main pool has signs saying hotel guests only but I don't see how they could possibly monitor that with the crowds). The hotel fireworks show is on the beach so anyone can come from other hotels to watch it up close without actually paying to stay at the resort. The restaurants on the resort are very expensive - it was much cheaper to walk off the resort and eat somewhere else. However I will say that it was nice staying right on the resort (I guess you're paying for the convenience). The pools were very nice and it really is the widest and nicest part of Waikiki Beach. The landscaping around the hotel was beautiful. It was fun walking through the village and the shops in the evening. Overall I don't think we would stay here again as it is not worth the extra cost but we still had a good time while we were here.","October 30, 2018"

"We stayed at the HHV last October and loved it so much we couldn't wait to come back. Both times we stayed in the Ali'i Tower, which is really great. Last year we had an ocean front room, which was amazing. This year that room type was sold out, so we got an ocean view room. We pretty much love everything about this place, but I do have a few complaints. The ocean view room still had a great view, but every night there was music BLARING so loud that we couldn't even sit on our balcony and enjoy the scenery. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it was from the hotel next door. I heard a lot of other guests at the pool complaining about it as well. If it's another property, I'm sure there's not much the HHV can do about it. However, if I was the owner/manager, I'd be having a word w/ the owner/manager of the place next door. I would politely ask them to turn the music down because I had a lot of angry guests. Let me add that my hearing is really bad, so if it was too loud for me, I feel sorry for other guests that were subjected to this. (The singing was TERRIBLE. It sounded like really bad karaoke.) Even with the sliding glass door shut and the TV turned up, we could still hear that horrible music. The only other complaint I have is that sometimes the kids can get a little rowdy in the pools. (I'm referring to the smaller Ali'i Tower pool, not the larger pools that seem more geared towards families.) There's a sign that says no pool toys allowed. I can't remember the exact wording, but it sounded like they are allowed for babies/toddler as they need them to stay afloat. Several times there were groups of kids that had about 5 or 6 rafts and inner tubes in the pool. 90% of the people at that pool were relaxing, reading, having a drink or two. It was nice and peaceful and quiet . . . and then in comes a group of kids that jump in the pool and splash everybody or spread out and throw a ball to each other taking up all the room. I understand that those families pay their money too, but if I had kids, I would bring them to one of the larger pools where they can run around and play with other kids. I see a lot of comments about it being pricey, . . . . but it's Hawaii. I think everybody in the world knows HI is expensive. I don't really agree w/ the daily resort fee, because we didn't have a need for any of the things it covered except for Wi-fi (and I believe as a Hilton Honors member, we get that free anyways??). Under the resort charge, you're supposed to get free local calls, but last year they charged me for a phone call to the pizza place on their property. Overall, it's a great resort, but you have to understand going in that it is expensive and busy. (Just remembered another thing - the hot tub at the Ali'i Tower was out of commission the whole time we were there. We could've used another hot tub, but we paid extra money because we wanted the private pool/hot tub/bar area. A little disappointing, but not the worst thing.)","October 30, 2018"
"We recently planned a long weekend away with some friends to celebrate some birthdays and anniversaries. We traveled 14 hours to Folly Beach because one of the couples had traveled there before. Since it was such a long trip for basically a long weekend, we called Avocet to see what the chance was of an early checkin. According to the booking site we used, the house we chose was not rented the week before we wanted it. We called the day before we left and was told we could most likely check in early but we’d still have to call the next morning. We left on our trip around 9 pm, drove all night and arrived in Folly Beach around 11 am. We went directly to Avocet and was met with total rudeness. The people in the office would not even make eye contact as they told us there was no chance of checking in early because “ they were at the mercy of the cleaning people”. We explained to them that we arrived there that early because of what we were told the day before and basically, it was “ oh well, sorry”. We made the best of the time as to not start the weekend off on a bad note and eventually ended up wandering until we found our house. We pulled in at a public beach parking lot 2 house away and walked over to the house. We were met by a housekeeper who said she was all done there and would contact Avocet to let us in. This was around 1 pm. We tried the door for the next 3 hours but needless to say, they didn’t let us in until 4 pm. So much for Southern hospitality!! I will not return to Folly Beach unless I can find another realtor who rents homes there and knows a bit more about customer service!!! In addition, I will be also writing a review on the property. We are not a fussy, high maintenance group at all and I have never stayed in a house in such disrepair! The pictures they published had to be years old when the furniture, cabinets and chairs were not broken and stained!!!","October 30, 2018"
"We spent the week here for our anniversary. Couldn’t fault a single thing the resort was amazing. Very clean, helpful staff, top notch food and to suit everyone’s needs. The hotel facilities were beyond amazing.","October 30, 2018"
"I recently stayed for a week at the Ali tower in Hilton Hawaiian Village. My beautiful one bedroom suite faced south east and overlooked the beach with a beautiful view of diamond head. Although I worked business meetings every day of my stay, because my room was close to my temporary office at the mid pacific conference center, these exceptional accommodations made the trip much easier. Next time, i will stay there on vacation.","October 29, 2018"
I am a Hilton Honors member so I am sad to say that the resort is crowded and loud. It took an hour to check in and although we were upgraded - not sure that it was helpful. We were awakened at 8 AM to loud hammering outside our lanai. We are on the third floor and the pool on the second was having construction right to the edge of the lanai. The Ali I tower room was good- but there were areas of spilled coffee in the bathroom and stains on the nice curtains. At the special pooled guests “hogged” the cushioned loungers over looking the ocean by leaving their towels and belongs- these rude guests were not seen for at least two hours. No policy is in place to suggest guest remove themselves when leaving as I checked with the pool attendant and the Ali’i front desk. On the pathways guests are pushy at walk righ into you. Super pool is super loud. The resort just happens to be in Hawaii but otherwise has no Aloha spirit. I hope people were able to experience other areas and islands to get a glimpse of the real Hawaii.,"October 29, 2018"
"Had a 5 night stay here and I gotta say while the place has plenty of facilities and the room was nice, the whole place is focussed on catering to the Asian traveller market. Everything... the food on site, the shopping in site & majority of the activities offered. Even certain staff members (more than a few) were rude and dismissive of anyone who wasn’t the “target market”. Very poor.What needs to happen is the introduction of some more family friendly eateries on site, ie iHop, Outback Steakhouse etc that are more family friendly and not catered to a certain market only. There’s a big reason why families have to go off site for meals at HHV and it’s because the food doesn’t cater to them as a family..... and it’s really expensive which is another big minus!On two occasions I had to make the HHV aware of poor staff behaviour and the lack of facilities. These will obviously not be actioned due to the fact we are but 1 family on holiday and not the targeted market. Overall, the room & view was good, there are facilities available but very expensive, you’re better off staying elsewhere and closer to the town centre where you have cheaper food choices and more of them.Sadly, we won’t ever stay here again, the staff rudeness and lack of decent on site facilities for families have sealed its fate for our next visit.","October 29, 2018"
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki. All of the amenities and service was excellent. The location was also awesome in relation to all of the stuff in town. The only negative that we could find was the cost of breakfast,"October 28, 2018"
We’ve travelled here before but first time stay in the Kalia Tower at the entrance of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Our 16th floor room facing the ocean has spectacular views! Mahalo to the Kalia Staff for a wonderful stay!,"October 28, 2018"
"We stayed with HHV for 4 nights, our reservation was rather a complicated one. Our first night we took advantage of the HHV suite sale when it offer 50% discount on suites, the second night was on award redemption, the last two nights we used the AMEX Hilton card free weekend nights certificates, so we actually have 4 different reservations with Hilton online booking. The day before we arrival, I was able to msg with HHV thru Hilton app, the front desk was so wonderful they were able to link all the reservations together and allowing us to staying in same junior suite all 4 nights, for this I have to give HHV 5+ stars.The resort is huge, you really don't need go anywhere to enjoy all the Hawaii funs, the bazaar has everything, from a high-end LV store to 2 local ABC market for your everyday needs.Here are some very important tips.1. Please do your self a favor, go with digital check in on your Hilton app, you can save yourself hours from standing in the long long check in line.2. If you Hilton gold or diamond member, and only if you are doing online check in, instead of the standard $10 per person food credit, ask for continental breakfast voucher at the Rainbow Lanai, it's buffet style, offers many selections including several hot Asian breakfast items, and it's $29.95 per person if you paying cash.3. Honolulu is expensive, to save yourself some money, instead of paying $30_35 for a taxi or uber for one way transporting from airport to HHV, you can ride the city bus for $2.75. After you claim your luggage, you can go back to the arriving hall on 2nd floor, go outside and across the street, ride the bus 19/20, it will take you to HHV in 50_60 mins. And to save yourself about 5 mins of walking to the HHV front desk, you can get off the bus at the Ilikai hotel stop, it's one stop before the HHV stop, but it's more close the HHV open air check in front counter.","October 28, 2018"
We stayed for 4 nights. The resort is huge but also quite busy... obviously. It is in a great location and the proximity to the ocean is awesome for sure. There is a food truck by the lagoon which serves great shrimp. The equipment rentals (boards and whatnot) were quite expensive. We paid for a junior suite upgrade which listed it on my email as being in the Rainbow tower... which we didn’t get. I only found out that we were in Diamond Head after the front desk agent had made the keys and charged us. The room was very dated but the balcony was huge. This is the only reason we kept the room. All in all decent but not the typical Hilton standards for modern rooms that I am used to.,"October 27, 2018"
Just loved our three nights at the Hawaiian village. Would highly recommend the Ali’i Tower because of the private pool and dedicated check in right in the tower. The room was spacious with a nice view. Really liked that there were many restaurants and shops right on the property. The diner was good and we visited the ice cream shop more than once! Very handy ABC store as well. You can rent beach chairs if you want. On check out day we could use the facilities as long as we liked and if you are a Hilton Honors member there is also access to a hospitality room to shower etc before you leave. We would definitely stay here again!,"October 27, 2018"
We were very disappointed with the quality of the hotel for the price they charge. There were holes in the wall in both rooms we stayed in in the elevator doors were all scratched and stained. The refrigerator in our room the week prior also was not working and our food spoiled. For this property being a Hilton property it did not appear to have the upkeep that as expected with the chain. We also thought the prices and the restaurants were absurd for the quality of the food that we received. We paid half the price for the same food in other restaurants around town in the quality was the same if not better. The resort fee is also unnecessary as many of those benefits are offered for free at other hotels. We probably will pick a different hotel for our next stay in Hawaii. ,"October 27, 2018"
"Parking is $43 to $50. Resort fee is $40. Chairs, umbrellas etc were too pricey. Food was decent and slightly high priced. Bed was less then great. Water pressure was great. Location is great but all together too expensive and not a top 10 hotel experience I have had. ","October 27, 2018"
"“Village” is the right word to describe this. Definitely a small city, complete with a Dr! Favorites: walking around the lagoon, close to anything you could need, nice room with plenty of space for strollers and two cribs, wonderful view, great service from most staff (better than average travel experience). Wine/beer opener next to ice machine is very smart. Cautionary: very crowded/noisy resort, long restaurant lines, lagoon is way colder than ocean which made it tough for toddlers to enjoy. That said, colder is better to reduce bacteria in a concentrated environment so don’t change it lol. Parking is expensive and traveling the distance between parking and hotel room was quite a workout with little ones.We were in Diamond Head tower. There was a US post office in our tower which made it easy to send souvenirs to loved ones. Whalers General Store, also in our tower, was a nice alternative to ABC with several healthy options for kiddos. Just outside of our tower was the Tapa pool & bar as well as Lanikai Juice which had actual vegan options available. I ate the vegan curry wrap (which was tasty but messy) and at other times, enjoyed a vegan acai bowl and a smoothie with vegan protein. Charges to our room were not the easiest with staff but they accommodated us with only minor delays. I would stay there again, no doubt. Just important to understand the trade offs - the better the view + more available resources (shopping/food), the larger the crowd.","October 27, 2018"
"We had been wanting to stay here to check the property out to see if it was suitable to bring the family the next trip to Hawaii. This seems like it will be a good place. The lagoon looked great as we are always concerned when the little grand kids go in the ocean. We like the selection of floats and other things available to rent by the lagoon. We also really liked the Village shops just across the street so the kids can go shopping for the their souvenirs, etc. Also there were a good selection of food items in the ABC store and the Wiki Wiki market onsite to cut down on the cost to not have to go out for a more expensive dining option with the family. We were only staying one night before our cruise ship departed the next morning but this fir our needs perfectly. We were close to the ships pier and not that far from the airport. We went down to Waikiki for dinner and took a quick cab ride to and from the hotel to get there.","October 27, 2018"
"We were extremely fortunate to have our vacation land on the 2 days that the Hilton Hawaiian Village was hosting their “Nightmare on Kalia Road Haunted House.” Being a fan of things like this, I was eager to experience if the Hilton could live up to my expectations. After paying a $10.00 admission fee, which by the way goes to Hawaii based charities, we were ushered into the haunted house. Now I have to tell you, I was really impressed with the whole maze that had scary and well thought out scenes in every room. In fact, it was even better than ones I have seen at amusement parks. Hats off to the Hilton for having the Halloween spirit! We hope to return next year and see it once again!","October 27, 2018"
"Our stay here as excellent! The service was over the top and everyone was extremely helpful with any issues that arose.We went with another couple to celebrate our anniversaries but for some reason that didn’t show up in their records. We were booked in completely separate towers, but they quickly worked to get our rooms switched and were on the same floor in the same tower. We needed an extra top sheet and shortly after the call, housekeeping was dropping one off. The other couple we went with had an issue with their tub draining and maintenance was there minutes after the call. Overall, the service was incredible.Our flight was later in the afternoon and our checkout was at 11. They did not have late checkout available, but instead offered us a hospitality room and were allowed 20 min per person to get cleaned up and ready for our flight. This was perfect for us to get prepared and relax before heading to the airport.This resort offers awesome amenities, phenomenal service, and is a great value for the money.","October 27, 2018"
"We stayed in the Rainbow Tower and had a beautiful view of Diamond Head. I was recovering from knee surgery and was accompanying my husband who was attending a conference at the resort. I really enjoyed long hours sitting on the balcony reading and enjoying the view. I also liked the roped off, calm swimming area in front of the resort as I was unable to swim in rougher areas due to my knee. Would I go back? Probably not. While the rooms were nice, they were nothing special and certainly not worth the high price we were paying. The property was very crowded and it was difficult to find a lounge chair by the pool if you weren’t there early. The line up at Starbucks each morning was at least 15 minutes long. The signage was very poor and it was a long and confusing walk to get to the only gym on the property.","October 27, 2018"
"My second stay here, but a bit far apart. This place is still beautiful and big, very big but now it's not relaxing at all!! Too much noise, caters to families, and quite pricey. Was turned off by the whole check-in mess. It's crowded and they do a pre-checkin?? Crowds of people, who jumps in line ahead of others,very disorganized. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower. It's roomy but a bit dated. We had an ocean view with a balcony high up but could still hear the noise. Pool is very crowded,kids splashing everywhere. Beach is nice but they change an arm and a leg to rent chairs and umbrellas. The lagoon area is nice but again rentals for canoes etc is high. Lots of food options and you never really have to leave the resort. Zip check-out seemed simple but in the end they changed me for a key they said I didn't return! I dropped everything off as requested. It was subsequently reversed but had to make a couple of calls. I gave it a 4 for it's location and the property is beautiful! Service was generally friendly... but I felt like it was too busy of a place to really chill.","October 26, 2018"
"We had a lovely one week stay at the Hilton. We were able to upgrade our room, which is a big deal to me. It had a spectacular view and the room was always kept clean and tidy. The maid service staff was so friendly. The restaurants, on the property we ate at, were very good. The buffet for breakfast was very expensive but the quality and variety was very good. This hotel is so big. The pools were nice. The beach staff was awesome too. I do recommend when you check in, that the front desk staff explain the elevator system to each guest. It was a little confusing to start. Several guests were lost until another guest explained how to use them. It wasn’t difficult but it was just a system I have never seen before. Being from Las Vegas, nothing should be surprising. Overall it was a fabulous time and I definitely recommend this Hotel. It is so big and can accommodate families with children or just couples. ","October 26, 2018"
Stayed in Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel while experiencing a flight delay out of Hawaii and will definitely be back. Service was fantastic hotel rooms were amazing and position right on Waikiki beach is great. Didn’t have enough time to experience all services offered however will do this when back in Hawaii. You won’t be disappointed.,"October 25, 2018"
"Completely underwhelmed by HHV. After paying less per night to stay at Disney Aulani than the amount we’ve paid to be here at Hilton I wish we had stayed at Aulani longer. Tired old room. Tiny space, dirty wet, smelly carpet and a crappy “upgrade” to a higher room, We’ve stayed in places in the world a hell of a lot nicer than this for a lot less money. The view is pretty but definitely not worth the $600+ per night. Save your self the dissatisfaction and disappointment and research some where else in Waikiki! I wish we had!","October 24, 2018"
"We arrived at the this hotel at about 3pm and it was very warm and humid. We noticed that there was quite of a long line for both General and Hilton Honors check in. I’m talking like 30+ deep for each line. After an hour of sweating and waiting we watching 3 agents taking their marry ole time with each person checking in, it was getting ridiculous. We watched one gal with a stroller gab with the check in agent for at least 40 min. They did finally come around with so small bottles of water to keep us hydrated. So the total check in time was approximately 2 hours. We finally reached the desk and the female agent was pretty snooty with my wife having questions. Excuses us for asking!Now mind you we visited the hotel unknowingly it was fall break for kids that week. So it’s probably a little more chaotic then normal.We received our room keys pool towel cards etc etc...We headed off to our room!This is a huge property with many of hotel towers. So it can be a distance from the check in area to your tower. Fortunately we were in the Tapa tower. So it was very close and to all things necessary.We were located on the higher floors and overlooking Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. Gorgeous view with a balcony.The problem is it’s very noisy all the time out on the balcony. The pools stay open pretty late and the kids and adults are very loud shouting and playing in the pool till very late. The music from the bar is blaring till late.There are quite a few places to eat on the property but very pricey. If you don’t mind $65 for bacon and eggs breakfast and juice then this place is your palace! We found a IHOP across the street for a third the price. We did eat at the Round Table Pizza a couple times and it wasn’t to bad.There is a ABC convenience store on the property for all of your needs as far as cereal, drinks, snacks, Advil etc etc...The parking (if you rent a car) can be very expensive! They offer valet and self parking garage. There is a parking garage right across the street about a 4 min walk from the hotel that is $185 for a month unlimited access. If your there for a week it’s half the price the the Hilton offers. It’s a nice safe garage and very clean. The bus and trolley service run real close to the hotel if you need transportation. All in all I gave this property 2 stars.It’s a nice place but crowded and crazy all the time. The prices are high for standard services.Not exactly where I would stay for a week of R&RCheck-in process is horrible! Hopefully if your booking a stay you’ll have a better experience than we did!","October 23, 2018"
I had a business trip but was able to take my wife on the trip. The resort was great and the rental car was upgraded to a Jeep at no additional cost. The Jeep was worth its weight in gold and the Friday night fireworks show at the hotel was a nice tough. The Hilton also up graded my room and with all the shops you could never leave the resort. However the island is well worth exploring and we did exactly that. I would not recommend going to any of the suggested beaches or attractions because they are very crowded. We simply used all the public beaches which are all over whenever we were not in the resort. Loved the Hilton and the island would return without question. Below is a view from my ocean view room and a public beach area,"October 23, 2018"
Great location right on Waikiki beach. Front desk lacked personnel and it took a very long time for each guest to check in. Be aware that if you are with a group it is a long walk from the coach area to the front desk and the flooring is very rough on wheeled suitcases. Directional signage is minimal so it is easy to get lost. Room was good as well as the restaurants.,"October 23, 2018"
"This resort is ridiculously huge. Plan on doing lots of walking. Room we had in Tapa Tower was showing some wear and tear. AC never got room cooled down below 69 degrees (I like 65 degrees). Food at the various restaurants not very good, but was expensive. They add on an exhorborant resort fee which doesn’t cover a whole lot except WiFi. As a Hilton Honors Diamond, not much was offered for my loyalty!","October 23, 2018"
"There were some mixed emotions with this stay. When checking in, we were a couple of hours early and the room was not ready ( no issues here ) and I started talking about upgrades and there was a room on the 26th floor of the Oceanfront Rainbow Tower available and ready to go and we agreed to a rate and off we went. We were so glad we did, the view is simply amazing and it takes your breath away. The one big disappointment, the room of this standard only had double beds in it ( which we did know ) which should be reviewed considering the cost of the room. The room could easily fit queen beds. The village itself is exactly that, it is massive. We spent a couple of hours walking around and getting our bearings which I would recommend you doing, as it is so easy to get lost here. The resort itself is clean and well kept, the pool area and the slides were loved by the kids and many hours were spent here. The downside to the resort were the onsite restaurants. Yes, they are expensive but do your research and you know what you are paying before you go to one.We went to two sit down restaurants, ( I’m not writing about take away options that we took, these were all fine ) the first one was Tropics and we left as there was an hour wait. This was on a Friday night where they do not take reservations. The reason for the long queue was in our opinion due to poor management.There was a sprinkling of rain before we tried to get a table. This made many tables unusable as the restaurant was not water proofed and the floor was wet and slippery to walk on.Safety of course comes first, but the fact that there was blue sky above us, no rain in sight, but there was no one attempting to make the area safe by drying out the area. This would have eliminated a significant wait and we would have been happy to join the queue but decided to go elsewhere outside of the resort.We did enjoy a meal at Fresco's. The meal was great, the table service matched this but that is where it ended. We also did not have a reservation here, but with the restaurant 90% empty at the time, didn't think this was an issue. We were told there was a 20 to 30 minute wait which we accepted, and it was recommended that we enjoyed a drink from the bar which we did as it was happy hour.The service here was terrible. The bar staff were rude and barely acknowledged you, and on two occasions, they did not directly hand you the drink itself, it was put down near you which one had to stretch to reach. They also do not believe in handing out the correct change, for you to calculate and then make the necessary tip. They did not provide coins, and rounded the costs of the drinks up and all we received were $1 bills, with an indication of what they expected to receive by way of a tip.It felt like we were receiving the tourist rip off. If you want to come in, you need to pay for drinks first, as it is happy hour, staff will try and take as much money as possible from you before we take you to a table. They also would not allow you to put happy hour drinks on the food tab. You had to leave your table to go to the bar to get them yourselves. The other negative impact on our stay was human error. Our room and upgrade was all paid for, and someone decided to bill to my credit card USD 2100 + for the cost of the room again halfway through our stay. I only detected this as we were going to leave the resort for the day and I checked how much credit was available on my card. This error maxed out my credit card, therefore unable to use it and we were confined to the resort.To the credit of the staff. It took a small amount of time to identify the error and correct this with Mastercard, however, it took 2 days to get the funds back again. There was a good will gesture offered which was accepted, but it changed the whole dynamic of our stay as the error stopped us from completing the tours that we wanted to do, as we had to check out the day after the funds were returned. One last final positive. We checked out on a Saturday, and on the Friday night the resort puts on a fireworks display. As we had an upgraded room, we were able to view this display from our balcony.It felt like the fireworks were literally landing on top of us and it was a special way to conclude our American 4 week trip.

"Wonderful place to stay. Huge resort so if you are into that then this is the place. What i love about this resort is so many options to around to eat and shop. The beach is great however the price of the chair/umbrella rental is out of this world, nearly $70 a day for 2 chairs and 1 umbrella. We went to Walmart bought 2 chairs and an umbrella for $120 used it for 8 days it was perfect, we paid it forward and gifted them, to 2 sweet ladies from Dallas!!! Hawaii is expensive so prepare to pay to play however, it is beautiful and worth it. Bali steak house is the only fine dining on the resort, but the food is delicious by far my favorite food option. Housekeeping lacked a little could use some improvement but being in paradise you overlook the short comings. Staying in the rainbow tower was excellent if you are a beach person as myself the elevators let you out steps from the beach. Friday nights they do fireworks on the beach and we had a perfect view from our balcony. The ABC shop is everything 1 stop shop do all your shopping from food to booze to souvenirs great. The Lua was great highly recommend a great experience. Friday many vendors visit the hotel so wonderful thing to purchase. The beach on this resort is accessible by the public but you never feel unsafe a local fish truck Gilligan’s shrimp parks in the local parking lot daily and has great fish and fries, shaved ice was wonderful all flavors all for a reasonable price. Local coffee/ice-cream shop on the grounds was wonderful for breakfast snacks and late-night ice cream. If you can ford a helicopter tour highly recommend wonderful experience!!!We love the Hilton Hawaiian Village and will be back.","October 23, 2018"
"I had a horrible experience with my family. First off, for the money, there are much nicer hotels on Oahu. The rooms are nothing special, location and amenities are nice, but the staff is pretty unpleasant and snooty. The hotel bed gave me bed bugs and all of my clothes were infested. I was horrified to think they could have given them to my two young children. Long story short, Hilton refuses to take accountability and basically blew me off. I would never, ever, stay at another Hilton Hotel.","October 23, 2018"

"This property is extremely expansive and has anything you could need from multiple restaurant options to shopping, beach access, free daily activities, etc. The rooms are very clean (stayed in multiple towers on various visits), the staff super friendly, and the food options diverse. With two locations for music nightly, there are lots of entertainment options for everyone. There were many pools depending on what you were looking for from slides and hot tubs to a smaller, quieter rooftop pool. The view is amazing and the large beachfront is ideal. They have tons of activities on site for everyone from 8 to 80. The staff has gone above and beyond in every way to make sure our stay was a great one! We loved our extra perks (shoutout to Claire B for impeccable customer service). Just another wonderful stay at our favorite property in Oahu.","October 22, 2018"
"We stayed in the Rainbow Tower for a large business conference. I can’t really complain about anything in particular, but nothing really stands out either. The rooms were clean and amenities were all as expected. The only reason I’m writing this review is to notify future couples and business travelers; there isn’t one single area set aside for quiet relaxation or adults-only ambiance. This is a massive resort and the ultimate in “family friendly,” and that’s great. Your kids will LOVE it here!! But if you’re traveling without kids, this isn’t the place. We heard screaming kids from the moment we woke up to the moment we went to sleep every single day. Hilton would be wise to set aside one of the five pools as an adults-only option for business travelers and couples.","October 22, 2018"
"Aloha! We stayed here for seven nights with our elementary school aged kids in a junior suite in the Rainbow Tower. We booked almost a year in advance during a suite sale. Favorites:Suite — perfect for adults in the king, one kid on the sleeper sofa and another on the armchair chaise. Great view of the lagoon and sea. PlayStation was a bonus! Free activities —Enjoyed the daily activities like yoga, lei making, hula lesson, ukulele lesson!Resort — centrally located in Waikiki with tons of on-site eating options and many others nearby via the beach or walking about a mile to the swanky outdoor mall. Beach umbrellas and chairs and water activities are extra but fun. Lagoon was great for the kids. Pools were a little on the small size but the kids loved them and the slides. Service — loved the free options for a late checkout as well as use of a room for a couple of hours in the evening to shower up before our overnight flight. Use the app for digital check in...by far the shortest check in line.Suggestion — Please add more water filling stations and shade at the pools. Thank you!","October 22, 2018"
"We normally go on vacations and stay at any given Hilton Hotel or Hilton Homewood Suites (the last times were in Seattle, WA & San Diego, CA & Fairfax, VA).However, although we booked for 4 nights in advance (10/17 through 10/21/18), I had to cut it short after the second night.Do not ever stay in the Tapa Tower, especially our Room #2548. Even the hallway carpet outside leading into our room was dirty.Cobwebs adorn the rusty wall/ceiling sprinkler heads in our hotel room.There was a lot of dust accumulation in the main vent of the A/C wall. Upon booking any hotel, I always tell the hotel we stay at that both my kids are highly allergic to dust.""Green growth"" on the bathtub fixtures as well as on some bath tile floors were evident.We took photos of our dirty room as evidence for review.Always check for new bed sheets, pillow sheets, and duvet covers before sleeping. My wife had to request for new replacement duvet covers for both beds due to the unclean smell (as we entered the room for the first night).Never use a hotel's glass containers to drink. Always use paper/plastic cups.We were able to leave after the 2nd night. Luckily, we were able to move to a more modern & cleaner hotel located down the street (I took photos of all mentioned problems and showed it to the front desk lady). The front desk lady was going to charge me an extra $175 for staying past the usual check-out time. I told her my continuing education class that day was from 7am to 2pm and that my wife and kids had to stay somewhere until I could get back by 2:30pm. Only after I requested to speak to her attending night supervisor (the night of Thur 10/18/18), I then received a courtesy late check-out by 3pm.NOTE: This is not typical of Hilton Hotels which I entrust with my family for our business and vacation stays.Unfortunately for us, it had to be in Hawaii !!htndmd","October 22, 2018"
"The Hilton Hawaiian village is perfect for families that love the laid back holiday. Between all the pool, lagoon,and beach you don't need to leave the resort if you don't want to. The kids watched the fireworks from their floating rings in the middle of the lagoon. Perfect holiday spot will definitely be back","October 21, 2018"
"This hotel is perfectly located. Restaurants, stores, beach, all right there. It's like having beach town and a city all in one. The rooms are a great size, clean, and have an extremely comfortable bed The price, I think is reasonable. . I would recommend this place. ","October 21, 2018"
"Great if you have a combination of business and leisure, would not choose for a dedicated faction. Our 1 BR suite in Kalia Tower was spacious, had every amenity you hope for (fridge, coffee machine, blenders, full kitchen, etc.), and housekeeping was excellent. The room was in top top shape.I realize it is downtown and space is at a premium but the pool areas and beach are crammed with people. Zero shade at any of the pools, no umbrellas, no cover at all unless you reserve and pay for a cabana. So if you have kids or just want a few hours of sun you need to leave for periods of shade. At the beach you pay $30-40 per day for an umbrella setup. This may be the norm for Waikiki so many of you may say “uninformed newb”, I get it. But compared to the Caribbean or Mexico or other resorts I have frequented, it is not relaxing by the pools at all. Chaise lounges are inches apart around every pool and there is a constant stream of guests and workers walking by, constant. Also, no pool service for drinks or food. One small towel given for each guest and it only covers half of each chaise lounge.Again, the room was a 10 out of 10, and maybe the pools are similar elsewhere in Waikiki, but definitely not like a resort in the Caribbean or probably elsewhere in Oahu outside of Waikiki. My trip was only 6 days with 1.5 of them working so I did not want to hop islands or hotels.The “village” has everlasting good restaurants that are good and is very convenient for exploring town and going on excursions.Goofy cafe is a 5 minute walk. FANTASTIC local, fresh Hawaiian style breakfast and lunch. Local, fresh, mostly healthy options but really well-prepared and visually will make your mouth water. The staff is great too. Don’t let the name or the sidewalk view turn you away. We ate there three times!","October 21, 2018"
Huge complex but service was excellent.Food was surprisingly good.The tower we were in was an older one (Diamond Head Tower) but still clean and serviceable.You can stay in the complex and not really miss anything 'Hawaiian'. They have a beach with a protected lagoon for swimming and snorkeling and a pier where boats leave for other ocean adventures. If you don't like salt water there are several pools to lounge around or hang out with the kiddies.The bus depot for other other land adventures is at one end of the property.,"October 21, 2018"
"Been a few times, always the best. The beach is so good. They ask a lot with 200 words. Really, 200 characters? You’re asking a lot!I had a really good time.This is still not 200 characters?WTF? Should I just use random letters?","October 21, 2018"
"Beautiful resort and our room was in the rainbow tower with a view facing north. Spectacular view of the city, marina, lagoon, and ocean! Can't thank the reservation clerk enough for helping us with a last-minute reservation and early check-in when or travel plans changed. Truly the Aloha spirit. Hope I get a chance to come back to Hawaii again and I will definitely be staying here!","October 20, 2018"
"First I’ll say the only reason I didn’t give it five stars is because of the very rocky beach. I’m guessing this is why they made their own lagoon. The hotel rooms and all the amenities are great. Multiple restaurants, shops, and convenient stores are all on the property. PSWhen you go out to the lagoon, walk out to the food truck parked in the adjacent parking lot. Food is great and the shaved ice is literally the best on the island. The syrups are fantastically flavorful!!","October 20, 2018"
"We have just finished our first stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village staying in the Kalia tower and we have to say that all the staff we met were excellent and always very friendly and helpfull. We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel complex as very good. If, like us, you are there on a friday night you will really enjoy the fireworks display, it was so colourfull and bright!","October 20, 2018"
"Best location for shopping and restaurants. Walking distance to everything you will need. Lots of activities that can be booked at the hotel. Quite beach, lagoon activities for all ages and the friendliest staff. ","October 20, 2018"
This hotel was fun for the family but ultra expensive. The restaurants and bars are ridiculously expensive. It felt like everything was a sales opportunity to them. The room had a great view but sharing two small double beds across a family of four was a struggle although the beds were extremely comfortable. The shower was rubbish with the pressure and hot water being pretty much non existent. The pools and lagoon were great for the kids although to hire things like paddle boards the price was through the roof. The staff were friendly and helpful.If I ever went back to Hawaii I would try to rent an apartment as you can pretty much use all of the Hilton's facilities anyway. It was nice being outside the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but if your looking for an affordable family holiday this is not the place.,"October 20, 2018"
This place is great for the family but be prepared to pay big bucks for it. The restaurants and bars are ridiculously expensive and they try to gauge you for every cent you have. The place just felt like everything was a sales opportunity to them. The pools and lagoon are great fun for the kids? Our view from our room in the Kalia tower was stunning. My wife and I travelled with our two kids and we had to share two double beds for the four of us. The beds were very comfy but small. The shower was rubbish as the pressure and hot water was pretty much non existent. It was nice being outside the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but if your looking for an affordable family holiday this is not the place.

"The Hawaiian village has a great location, wonderful beach and perfect views. Waikiki has changed a lot in the past decade but this is still one of the best locations. We had a beautiful suite overlooking the ocean with amazing views. The kids had a lot of fun on the beach and pool.","October 20, 2018"
"Although I didn’t stay at the hotel property, (I stayed at a nearby condo) I frequented the beach along the hotel and passed through its myriad rows of luxury stores and endless lines of tourists. The waves were gentle and there was smaller crowd compared to the beach further towards down town. The sunsets were beautiful!","October 19, 2018"
"Stayed in the Rainbow Tower overlooking the beach. Great room , could see the pool area as well as the beach. Saw the hotel fireworks Friday night right outside our balcony. Shops and restaurants abound. Simple check in even though we arrived mid morning. Every thing you might want is right here.","October 19, 2018"
"I was looking for a self contained resort in Hawaii with kid friendly activities. Hilton Hawaiian Village was perfect! The room was really comfortable, though I will say furnishings while good quality are a little tired (drawers kept opening, older upholstery, nicks in finish etc). This was the Tapa Tower, but I nonetheless enjoyed the stay, and I had a good view to the diamond head side, though it's also across from another tower. The bed was wonderful and the service fantastic. I was really impressed by the staff in every corner of the resort- everyone was pleasant, cheerful, and helpful. The resort itself really is perfect for a self contained vacation week - lots of restaurants, beach, pools, shopping and activities. We could have gone elsewhere but didn't feel the need to. A couple of tips: 1) it's a good idea to be a Hilton member before you go - you will have a better checking experience and other perks 2) if you make a reservation outside of Hilton's website - you won't earn any points for your stay! I was given other perks, which were good - but just be aware of this. 3) ask for extra towel cards for the pool/beach! 4) things close early, so consider taking snacks back to your room 4) the movie/game rental has different options in each machine - check all of them! I would definitely visit again, especially for a week or less - it's a great, relaxing option!","October 18, 2018"
"Hilton Waikiki is just enormous. Be prepared to wait on check in. If your early you can opt to pay $50US to check if another room is available and if so, you can upgrade at a premium to save waiting for the 3pm check in. Having travelled for 11 hours, we opted to pay and got a decent room at a considerable price.There are restaurants available and several on site ABC shops which have all your travel needs...ie BEER, Water food and souvenirs. The grounds are well kept. Wifi is free and works well in the room, but outside of your tower it stops. I would recommend the Hilton Waikiki to the traveller as it showcases the heart of the Island of Oahu.","October 17, 2018"
"I booked a Rainbow Tower Ocean Front room and was given room 2617.We stayed here for four nights after spending five nights at another hotel in the middle of Waikiki in an ocean front room. I wish I had stayed at the first hotel.I booked HHV with the intention of lazing by the pool or on the beach and simply relaxing, and experiencing the other end of the Waikiki strip. The check in was crazy with massive lines. There is essentially one check in desk for about 6 hotels. Painful.The room was basic, bathroom was small, bath was tiny (but deep). The water pressure in the shower wasn’t great and it took some time to wash the shampoo/conditioner out of my long thick hair.There was a large gap under the door to the hallway which let in light and noise. I could hear people walking and running in the hallway and their conversations. People in the next room closing doors made the walls and furniture in my room reverberate.We left our rooms in the morning and returned after lunch. For the first two days our rooms still had not been made up by the time we returned. As we had a siesta we told housekeeping not to worry about it. On the third day it was made up earlier. I think their housekeeping may be understaffed which is unfortunate considering the price we pay for a room and the small salary housekeeping staff are paid. One afternoon I returned to my room to hear the fire alarm in the adjacent room going off. I asked my son if he knew what it was and he said it had been going off for ‘ages’. After speaking with housekeeping i learnt it had been going off for approximately 40 minutes. I asked her about it and she said the guest was probably smoking in his room and she had ‘called it through’. I went in to my room to call the concierge/reception and got a voicemail. I found the housekeeper again and asked her to enter the room to check all was ok and that it was a false alarm. If there was a fire I wanted to start evacuating from the 26th floor. She reluctantly did so and I heard her call it through again citing that the neighbour was complaining.I tried calling concierge again, went to voicemail again. The only other option to call it through was the emergency number which I was considering.After the housekeeper reassured me there was no fire I ran a bath. It was at least another 40 minutes before the alarm was turned off. I thought this was poor.The pools were too busy and it was hard to get a lounge chair. When I did get one it was so noisy that I couldn’t relax. The lagoon looks lovely but was cold, murky and had a mild smell. The pool towel system was annoying. You get a towel card for each person in your room. Each card will get you one towel. When you return that towel you get another card. If you do not return those cards upon checkout they will charge you $10 for each missing card.I found the food in the restaurants in the village overpriced and ordinary. I sat down at a table at the cantina nearest the rainbow tower to order lunch and a cocktail. After ten minutes I was not acknowledged at all. I left.Compared to other hotels in Waikiki you don’t get much for your resort fee. Other hotels also provide tote bags and daily bottled water. The Hilton doesn’t. The gardens and ponds are lovely but I don’t like how they are exploiting the many macaws they have perched around the grounds for guests to gawk at and take photos.The view from the room was of the beach and Diamond Head. It was lovely and the best thing about this stay.This hotel is just too busy and impersonal, not my sort of place. ","October 17, 2018"
"Wow, what consistent disappointment. We were here a few years ago and the rooms and facilities were “dated” to put it kindly. Well, nothing has changed much and it’s even more dated than before. Customer service is basically nonexistent and the place is an absolute zoo at check in. In spite of upgraded rooms available, none allowed for Diamond HHonorsp members. We were told that our group rate did not allow for elite upgrades although the rate we paid was more than the rate available when I checked prior to coming here. A “manager” punched some keys on her keyboard and came up with some contrived, vastly inflated number for us to pay on top of our group rate in order to get a “better” room (that had the same old, terribly uncomfortable beds and 80’s decor with only a slightly better angled view of the ocean)- no thanks... I do understand that Honolulu is expensive but this place - wow - ridiculously overpriced. The food, drinks, adjacent shops and activities... be prepared to pay through the nose and be bled dry. There are beautiful places in Hawaii to come for a visit. We came from two gorgeous Marriott properties - one in Kaua’i and one in Maui where we were treated so incredibly well as Platinum Marriott members. Given the recent turmoil with Marriott, I was fully planning to switch to Hilton and am in the middle of a Diamond status match. Now, I find myself rethinking that. I would only stay here if boxed in by company requirements when there is a specific meeting occurring here. Not recommended.","October 17, 2018"
"I chose this hotel because of its beach location and the resort atmosphere. I was not disappointed. There are many stores, shops, restaurants/bars, and pools. I was originally on guard at check in because they did not have our resort view room available even though we checked in the day before. The family next to us had problems as well. However, I believe that because I am a Hilton Honors member, I was upgraded to an ocean view room at no additional charge or maybe it was because I was very nice during the 30 minutes while they were ""looking for a room"" . Everything worked out just perfectly. The resort is beautiful.","October 17, 2018"
"it was great to have a place to do all the shopping, eating and entertainment. I will stay there again when we go back to Oahu. The pools were nice but i wish they had more hot tubs. the shops were nice as well in the village. ","October 17, 2018"
"You can't be in Hawaii and not be in this place. And if you are a big Hawaii 50 fan like us, you should stop by this area, so happy to see the rainbow painted building seen on the opening of every H50 episodes. The beach is safe for the kids, and there's the option of the lagoon as well. So many dining and shopping options within the area. So convenient. And the fireworks ❤❤❤","October 16, 2018"
"A three night stay in the Alia tower, upgraded to a larger room on arrival which was nicely appointed. Great view of the beach from our room which was great, but unfortunately during our weekend stay a Beach Volley Ball Competition was being held right in front of our block, PA and music was very noisey. If you like a big resort this is for you, we would have preferred a hotel not so large.","October 15, 2018"
"Stayed in ALI'I Tower which we think has the best location of all the Towers in the resort. We were lucky to be allocated a room on a high floor so got to enjoy the beautiful ocean views as well as the Hilton fireworks on a Friday. The room size is okay but beds were smaller than that of a double. There is a sofa bed in the room. We have visited Hawaii a number of times and this was our first stay at the Hilton. Whilst we very much enjoyed the energy and dynamics that the Village offered including water sports, live shows, shopping, restaurants etc it was a little removed from the rest of Waikiki. If you enjoy causal walking of about 20 mins then distance won’t be an issue. On the plus side, the village is very family friendly and you don’t need to leave. Our kids throughly enjoyed it. Finally, we would not categories this hotel has luxurious- it appears to be nicer than the other towers but not international standard for luxury. Would stay here again. ","October 15, 2018"
"Beautiful grounds with pools throughout, nice beach out front. The downside is the resort does charge for everything, umbrellas, chairs on the beach etc, for the type of resort I would have expected the use of a beach chair & the music is on, loud until late. The upside is the place is huge, there are many spots to grab something to eat or a drink. The views are spectacular and it’s a family friendly resort.","October 15, 2018"
"In addition to what you pay for your room at this hotel, you are also assessed $40 per day for a “resort fee”. Fine, I thought to myself - this probably covers extra stuff like bicycles or surfboards. In fact, the stuff covered by the resort fee are things that are normally included with the cost of a room in other properties, like use of the gym and internet usage. What the resort gives you towards the rent of a surfboard or a beach chair (yes, you have to rent those here) is a pitiful 10% discount. It will also give you a microscopic discount on the inflated car rental fee charged by the car rental agency in the hotel. The “resort fee” is really nothing but a disguised increase in the cost of your room. I really expect better from Hilton. ","October 15, 2018"
"Stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Resort 5th October to 9th October and charged $1021US to the room.. Upon checkout I paid the bill in full, however the pre-authorisations were for $1000US we’re not cleared, so the bank has frozen the money. I returned to the complex a week later for a further 5 nights and told the manager my funds have not been cleared and they are refusing to do so. We even had my bank in Australia on the phone for over an hour informing them that they were wrong and telling them that I have paid in full and that the amount pre-authorised needs to be released, but the hotel won’t, even though they can see I have paid in full. The female manager was clearly an incompetent and was as rude as hell, and given the service throughout the stay was very poor, and obviously being a Hilton, completely overpriced, wasn’t worth the first payment let alone paying for this crap twice. Fortunately my bank will cancel these transactions through a credit card dispute (thank you ANZ Bank) but the frustration in dealing with these criminals is a disgrace. I recommend NEVER do room charges, keep a complete record of every transaction and don’t trust the front desk to resolve any issue, because they can’t. Overall stay, unpleasant, extremely expensive, and now fraudulently charged which now requires external action to resolve. I will never stay at this resort again!!!","October 15, 2018"
"We stayed in the Ali'i Tower at the Hawaiian Village Resort. The Tower was real nice. We are Diamond and our room backed up to the Elevators. So noisy. Air Conditioner did not work well and could not turn down to a temperature where we were comfortable to sleep. Great view.. Has a private pool for this tower. Beach is nice and a lot of options at the Resort. The downside is since the Resort is huge, there are a lot of people everywhere.","October 14, 2018"
"Just returned from a great vacation in Hawaii. Stayed three nights at the Hilton Hawaiian village. The resort grounds are great, there are several pools and an awesome beach and a nice variety of shops and restaurants from which to choose. The room we stayed in though I would only give three stars as it was very average, nothing special at all about the hotel room. Now you can give your own level of weight to that as in Hawaii how much will you be in the room anyway, but that is the reason for only giving four stars and not five. ","October 14, 2018"
"If you want a resort with lots to do, where basically you don't have to leave if you don't want to, this may be the place. It has it's own beach, which we loved and never got crowded during the day. It has a lagoon, many restaurants, bars and shops. 2 outdoor pools. Saturday evening they had a movie outdoors for the kids and families. Food everywhere was good. Need milk, wine, a snack? You're covered at an ABC store. The restaurant prices were reasonable (except for my $16 oatmeal!) They even have a food truck with the BEST coconut shrimp for less than $15. However, I agree with other reviews. The towers and rooms could stand to be updated. The place is massive so be prepared to walk. It's VERY busy. If relaxing is what you're looking for, this is not the place nor is Waikiki. It's very city-like, lots of traffic, buildings, etc.We ubered several places and it was @ $25 so factor that in if you're heading to sight see. Skip the tours and go to Pearl Harbor yourself. It's $1.50 to get in; best to reserve your place online as they allow only a certain number of people daily. And join the Hilton Honors to speed up your check in time. The lines were ridiculous. There isn't a check in for each tower so everyone stands in ONE line. But I skipped to the short line because I joined Hilton Honors; filled out the form while standing in line.","October 14, 2018"
"We stayed here recently in conjunction with an event that was being held at the hotel. We are Hilton Honors Gold members (as a caveat). We purposely did not do the digital check-in, even with as tempting as it was with the long check-in lines. We are glad we did as the app only allowed us regular rooms. We inquired about an upgrade, and they did! We were put in the Ali’I tower, the fifth floor, with ocean view. The customer service was terrific! The people were super friendly and helpful. I asked about where to pick up some waters, and they told me they'd have some delivered some to the room. They gave us priority seating to two of the onsite restaurants, access to a private pool and fitness area, etc. We are breakfast at the Lanai breakfast buffet and got the hot/American breakfast option(as opposed to the continental option that was ten dollars cheaper). It was a little pricey (39.99 a person before the $10/off voucher per person. The service and breakfast though were terrific!! We had omelets, monkey bread, fresh fruit, pastries and a few of the standard breakfast items. The room, although a little dated, was clean, nice, and we had no complaints. ","October 14, 2018"
"This is a great place! It sits on about 23 acres. It is extremely busy. There are plenty of eateries & shopping right here. It is centrally located. We have stayed @ 2 different towers, the rooms are very nice.","October 14, 2018"
"For those of you who are considering the Hawaiian Islands as destination, keep in mind Oahu is very developed and Waikiki Beach is tourist trap so it’s very crowded. If your looking to get away from the hustle and bustle, Maui is far more laid back. With that said, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is a massive complex of 8 towers. The room was clean but in need of a face lift....not sure when they last did renovations. Each tower has its own small pool and jacuzzi but most people seem to gravitate to the main building as it has a much larger pool. There is also a gym and Spa in each building which is convenient. Renting beach chairs/umbrellas for the beach is expensive so if you are planning an extended stay, I highly recommend popping into a Walmart on your way in and purchase your own as it will be more cost effective. There are many outdoor shops around the complex and restaurants....reservations highly recommended. Hawaii is expensive, especially the food. If I do find myself returning to Oahu which is highly unlikely, I will not stay in Honolulu. Overall, the Resort is just average.","October 14, 2018"
"The hotel has great access for disabled people. This also means great access for young children in stroller/prams. The staff around both the Lagoon and Paradise pool were excellent.The setup of this hotel is flawed. It's just too big! There are too many rooms available/capacity for the amenities and complex facilities. Basically you have 7+ high rise unit towers and Hilton have slapped a sign above the reception and check-in area. Facilities are great however each one is very busy. Basics like checking in took 40+ minutes - inexcusable! We have two young boys (1.5 and 3.5) and asked the tour desk for ideas - They suggested (on two occasions!) the ""Hilton Grand Vacation"" ownership presentation. My wife said you can't be serious - and she replied 'Oh yes we try and cater for children at the presentation'!?!? From Google (not hotel staff) we found both the Zoo and the Aquarium ok outings with young boys, both under $20 entry fee too. Pearl Harbour quite pricey as is their evening Luau. AlaMoana shopping mall about a 10 minute walk. Has small play area for kids outside Target.Overall felt like a business whose primary concern is their profits, not their guests. At check-in for example, the staff let us know how lucky we are that a water front room has become available, and asked would we like it? however instead of a free upgrade she then said ""it's another $90/night as well."" Or when you check-in early they will charge the $75 (after waiting 40+ minutes!). Little things like that at other hotels I've found they pass savings to the customer, certainly not here. Very disappointed for a Hilton hotel.Other pointers:The grounds are massive - it's not a boutique hotel, your tower may be up to a 5+ minute walk from reception.The hotel is very dated. Rooms could do with a renovation.Kalia Tower has en exceptionally slow lift. Perhaps worth asking for a lower floor so you don't spent half your holiday waiting for a lift.Diamond Head Tower is where the Uber/Taxi pickup service is.Fantastic gym, however (once again) very busy!","October 13, 2018"
"Excellent hotel for families. You have access to about 5 pools, plus the lagoon and beach area. The lagoon is a bit colder then the beach water but is great for younger kids. Plenty of shops and places to eat around the hotel. There's a starbucks in one of the hotel towers. Be prepared for a long way to get check in if you're in some of the other towers. We stayed in the Alii tower which has own check in which has hardly any queue. We were on the second from the top level (level 14), but I would recommend one level down on level 13, otherwise a concrete barrier can block your view. The resort fee is a bit expensive considering we paid so much for the room, plus we didn't use most of the stuff. wifi in the public areas of the hotel is pretty good. in room wifi is ok, but that that great some times. All hotel staff are friendly and helpful.","October 13, 2018"
"The good news is that views are spectacular, after that it goes downhill. This was a long awaited anniversary trip. We paid for a ""luxury"" room in the Ali'i ""Adult"" Tower. The walls were chipped, the rug old and damaged and the furniture stained. The room was large and airy but completely outdated. The noise level was high from construction and daily deliveries with trucks beeping while they backed up. We went to the pool on the second floor and it was full of noisy children while their parents did nothing. In the room they provided robes you could use and also purchase, however they had holes in them! Disgraceful. Over all very disappointed with the cost vs the expectations vs the delivery. We expected much more from Hilton.","October 13, 2018"
Having stayed in other hotels in Waikiki I was looking forward to staying here. The rooms are really showing their age and haven’t been maintained very well. The hotel is in a great spot and the pools are nice so if you aren’t planning on spending a lot of time in your room this might work. ,"October 13, 2018"
"We were reluctant to stay at the Hilton due to reviews, but we ended up being pleasantly surprised and sad to be leaving after our 2 night stay. Check in lines are long, yes. The grounds/pool areas are busy (and it is frustrating to see empty chairs reserved with towels or clothing items for hours). But the location is great, staff are friendly and the rooms are clean and comfortable. We upgraded to a Rainbow Tower room which was definitely worth it for the quiet mornings on the balcony enjoying a coffee and admiring the view of the beach and Diamond Head as you ease into the day. Perfect. We'll definitely stay again on ur next trip.","October 13, 2018"
"We found this hotel very...very overrated. So, we were 2 adults and 2 children age 12 and 9 with 3 other couples stayed here for 7 nights to celebrate our friend’s 40th birthday. He really insisted to just stay here and not anywhere else perhaps because others exaggerate it so that’s how we ended up here. We booked in April 2018 for Oct 18 stay, paying $310NZD per night for a standard mountain view room plus another $60 resort fee and no breakfast included. So, as we arrived it was just like a fish market waiting in a long queue with hundreds of other people. We were given Kalia Tower and had to have staff assistant to take our luggage there. Tipped USD10. Walked into the room and it looked so outdated and tired. Fridge was located in the bathroom, you can literally grab something out of fridge by just sitting on your toilet (yuck). There was no complimentary water given on arrival or on any of the days. Used their swimming pool and beach and again, it was just like a fish market with so...so many people. Once we checked in and until we checked out, no greetings from staffs or value of being a guest. We just felt like a number or strangers living in backpacking. No feeling of staying in a resort at all. The only good thing about this resort that we liked was the fireworks on each Friday night and shops/restaurants within their complex. But, not cheap...I would never go back...","October 13, 2018"
"So we arrived with friends to celebrate our 25th and 35th wedding anniversaries and a 50th birthday, firstly at checkin we where told we could not have rooms next to each other even though we had requested this at the time of booking !!!!! Then all of a sudden she managed to find 2 rooms together in the diamond tower 977and 979, the decor is dated carpets need a good clean, we are near lifts which constantly make a noise all night and top it off we are opposite a family with screaming children, we have now had 3 nights of disturb sleep !!! On the beach there are no sun beds or umbrellas unless you wish to pay $18 per bed plus a charge for umbetella I have never experienced a 4 star hotel which does not provide this facility , the village is very expensive to eat and drink and we can't use all the facilities in all the towers. We have now decided to hire a car to get away for the day, we expected to experience a traditional Hawaiian show but didn't expect to pay €100 dollars each unless we gave up 90 minutes of our holiday to sit though a promotional visit for a new tower !! totally disappointed is how I would describe our experience we have travelled half way across the world for what was suppose to be a holiday of a lifetime.

"We have been here many times and essentially its almost a resort and you dont have to go off the resort if you dont want to. There is shopping, restaurants, pools and activities. My kids are so familiar with the area they can almost go around blindfolded.It is expensive, and we paid for a rainbow tower room. As we were a little late in booking we only got a room with 2 DB in it. Not an issue for the kids, but my wife and I are used to a QS and it was a small bed. If you can book for a QS bed.We joined the Hilton club and when we arrived it allowed us to go to a pre check in area (Hilton offers a online check in which you can do a few days before and it helped us skip the line at check in. On line I could only get a room on the 17th floor, however politely asking for a higher floor got us to level 30- almost the top floor.This resort is expensive, but like Disney you are paying for convenience and location. The Hilton Hawaiian Village has an unrivaled location with facilities that are brilliant.We love staying there","October 10, 2018"
"After a transpacific cruise we stayed 4 days at the Hilton Hawaiian Village & one word sums up our stay « Paradise » Everything was perfect & we can’t wait to return for a longer stay. The setting is magical & a destination in itself. Our room in the Ali’i Tower was awesome, the view breathtaking. Kevin at the front desk went above & beyond to ensure our stay was perfect, what a wonderful man who loves people & an asset for the HHV. Only happy & positive thoughts when we returned home dreaming of going back. Thanks for the memories everyone. ","October 10, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village is one of my favorite hotels in the world. For the location and amenities the rates are actually quite reasonable. The views are gorgeous, the staff are accommodating and the convenience of location coupled with onsite restaurants and shopping can’t be beat- especially if you are traveling on business. The check-in process is a monster. Recommend downloading the Hilton app and doing online check-in which makes life a lot easier.","October 10, 2018"
"This place is huge.. with that being said you’d think they have this running like a well oiled machine... well think again. Upon arrival there were two lines of guests one was Hilton honors and the “regular” people that are probably staying at a Hilton hotel for their first time.. H.H has 6+ people checking people in while new comers had 1-2 waited 30-40 minutes in line to be checked in. Once we get up to the front desk the lady finds my reservation, and says she’s trying to find us a room with a king bed.. still searching she tells us there isn’t one available. (Cue me freaking out in my head-bc we are on our honeymoon) we ended up getting stuck in a two double bed room the first night. Switched rooms the second night to an “ocean view” to be compensated. Really not impressed and probably will not stay at a Hilton again. It’s unfortunate you spend so much money on a place like this for your honeymoon for it to not exceed expectations. Rooms= outdated and overpriced Grounds and resort- great if you are not wanting to get a car or leave the area. Tropics grill is my fav. PS The parking is $43 a day.","October 9, 2018"
Been there for 4times with my family .always made me happy.Nice location nice ocean view.great pool and kids activity .Every restaurant are good especially main pool bar I think same bartender been there for morethan 10years.Back scratchers!,"October 9, 2018"
"We stayed for 3 nights on our arrival to Hawaii. We were extremely tired and looked forward to some R&R. Unfortunately we were put in a room on the 21st floor that overlooked the Beach Volleyball Championship. We were not told of this, or that the music blaring from the speakers for 12+hours a day would be going on. We also were awakened at night from the loud music coming from the restaurant below. The bass from the music hit the windows like a loud heartbeat and was only escapeable by going somewhere far away from the hotel. That being said, the room was clean, the pool was nice for kids and families, the lagoon nicer for swimming. The view from our window was very nice overlooking Diamond Head and the pools. The atmosphere was definitely more for partying, and not for relaxing as there was no where to go to escape the music. We did the digital checkin and were rewarded with free continental breakfast which was absolutely fantastic. The best (and quietest) time of our stay. We will probably not be returning to stay in Oahu, having found the other islands more to our liking.","October 9, 2018"
This is the third time back to Hawaii and first time experience at Hilton. By far this has been the worst check in experience I have encountered on my travels. One person checking people in and so far an hour wait to still not be checked in. They definitely need to improve their check in process. ,"October 8, 2018"
"What an amazing trip. The hotel was stunning. Staff was beyond perfect, They went above and beyond not only for my birthday but what ended up being our engagement celebration. The pools were crowded but not too much, always towels available. The room was breathtaking Rainbow tower ocean view. Loved every moment","October 8, 2018"
This restaurant is located in the Hilton Hawaii Village near the shopping and Check in area. The food was excellent especially the bacon wrapped shrimp. They also have an early bird special that is very reasonably priced. Our waiter was very good and attentive and the bartender made very good drinks. We had a very nice leisurely dinner and then strolled around the nearby beach and lagoon area.,"October 8, 2018"
Loved this hotel! Perfect for families. Lots of space. Walked out your hotel room into the beach! Soo much choice at Breakfast buffet. Lots of pools to choose from. Fab!! Easy walks to surrounding shops and restaurants.,"October 8, 2018"
"Beautiful grounds...including shops, restaurants,pools,the lagoon, and in the ocean. We were on the 11th floor...ocean view...in the Kalia Tower with a magnificent view if everything. Only issue for us was the extensive walking...as this resort is so huge. Wish more golf carts/transportation was at the ready when we were.","October 7, 2018"
"The location and ease of transportation to all our events planned made this very special. The sheer volume of people there was a testament to that. Check in was much different than any hotel I've been to, so plan extra time. It takes about 3 days to learn where everything was, but it was all right there!","October 7, 2018"
"Hawaiian Village is a great place, even though it's pricey. Everything you need is on the property and close enough to other resorts with just a short walk. Tip, don't pay to watch the Hula show in the eve, you can see it free from many locations around the pool.","October 7, 2018"
"We did the Hilton vacation club presentation on our last trip to Waikiki and purchased their VIP package of one week to trial a membership. We were originally shown through the grand islander, which is lovely. We were given a room in the (not so) grand Waikikian. Room smelt musty and mouldy, was tired and looked like it could do with a good airing and an update. Not a great way to sell us on HVC membership. We saved ourselves the money, thanks for that Hilton","October 6, 2018"
"Everything about the resort has been well-covered in previous reviews, but I had to really dig to find other comments about the Jr. Suites in the Rainbow Tower, so I'm adding my voice. We booked this room type because we are traveling with our three little kids, and found the square footage to be more than adequate, especially the bathroom, which was nicely spacious and had a walk in shower that was ideal for rinsing everyone off after time at the beach.But the huge room was empty! There was a bed, a pull out couch (set up as a bed for our entire stay), two nightstands and a dresser, and a tiny desk with an uncomfortable upright chair. There was basically nowhere for the five occupants of the room to sit, other than the beds or the empty swath of carpet! I called down and asked if we could have some chairs brought (I had peeked during housekeeping and noticed that the standard rooms had a comfortable looking armchair) and I was told they ""don't bring any more furniture"" in a way that made me suspect I was not the first person to ask. They brought me a second luggage rack though :/We ended up pulling a patio table and chairs in off the balcony and setting that up in the middle of the room, and we STILL had extra space. Sitting on plastic patio furniture in our otherwise nice, large room really put a damper on my experience. I would not book this room type again. There's really no point to having that much space if you have to sit on the floor!","October 6, 2018"
"The location is amazing, a short walk to the Waikiki strip, but far enough away to be quite. Direct access to the beach. 5 Different Pools, the best 1 one is the paradise pool, but if you want to avoid kids in the pool, the Tapa pool or Kalia Tower pool are probably best. Each tower has its own pro's and cons. We stayed in the Kalia Tower and whilst an older tower, the rooms were fine, I liked the location because it was a quite area of the village, the tower has its own Starbucks and Pool, the only gym in the village was also in this tower, it also had its own Valet entry, and Taxi's and Uber could just pick up and drop off from there, without having to cross the village for the designated pick up location. I cant speak to any of the other towersIt really is a village, has its own shopping, 2 ABC's stores (Hawaii's version of 7-eleven), 2 Starbucks, many restaurants and much more. Most of the restaurants are quite expensive, leaving the village to eat is recommended.The negatives were being charged $75 to check in early and daily resort fee of $50 which you cannot pre pay. But if you do mange to get a good room rate it offsets these additional costs I guess","October 6, 2018"
"We were in a one bedroom apartment in the lagoon tower. The apartment was gorgeous, roomy and the balcony right over the ‘super pool’. The kitchen was fully stocked and the lounge room very modern and comfortable.Being right next to the lagoon and shops was so convenient and loved the atmosphere that the resort creates.Staff are friendly, helpful and professional.Highly recommended.","October 6, 2018"
"Loved this place, the beach is amazing and the hotel too. I've stayed here 4 times now and it just gets better each time. Already looking at booking for next year, I would highly recommend staying here, all restaurants are very close too.","October 6, 2018"
"We were upgraded to a better view because we are Gold Hilton Honors members. Here is what happened to us that made our stay memorable...I wanted to take a moment to pay respect to the Hilton team on our recent stay in Honolulu. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki. We used points for this vacation. Our stay was to be 6 nights. Unfortunately, we had to stay an extra 2 weeks because my wife had a serious accident offsite. This accident resulted in 3 facial fractures, 5 broken ribs and deep abrasions/contusions over 20% of her body. Her jaw was wired shut and she had pneumothorax which prevented her from flying. She also had to spend 4 days in the hospital. This was obviously a serious complication to our plans and this happened on the day before we were to leave.From the moment we arrived at the property, we were greeted by a friendly check-in person. Being Hilton Honor members allowed us to go to a special line avoiding a long wait for those coming from the airport. There was a personal concierge by email to assist us in anything we might need, and we did partake of their services for the first 5 days.It is what took place after the accident that really sets them over and above their competition. The following day we were supposed to check out and go back home. I called from the hospital and explained the situation. They graciously allowed us to stay in the same room and charged us a very reasonable rate until the doctors gave her the OK to fly. Special furniture was brought in to help us take care of her needs.There are two staff members we would like to especially point out for their untiring and kindly efforts to make us as comfortable and worry-free as possible.The first is Jessica Heath, Hotel Manager on Duty. Jessica was our main point of contact. She was the one who provided us with an affordable room after the accident, arranged the extra furniture and made sure we had a way for me to get to the hospital and later get us to the doctors for follow-up appointments and then back to the hotel for convalescence. She was thoughtful and most kind. There couldn’t have been a better person for this job!The second employee was a server at the Tapa Bar. Theresa was most professional and always on the ball. She always remembered me each night when I came down for my one drink, the Mai Tai.I don’t believe that we received any special attention or courtesies either because of being Gold Members or my wife’s injuries. I believe that everyone would receive these. I believe it is the Hilton way!","October 5, 2018"
Large family hotel. Multiple pools with access to many Starbucks coffee shops onsite private lagoon with several pools on offer.Weekly fireworks display is top class so be sure to ask for a room above the 5th floor or higher facing the water. Onsite Luau although culturally entertaining is over priced with a singular drink on offer and bar prices steep.Depending on the tower depends on the room age and quality. Some of the older rooms look tired but are clean. Close to the main shopping strip and plenty of onsite activities available.Overall a very good place to stay with families in mind.,"October 5, 2018"
"Flew in early and was able to get a room early for check in, The resort is clean and all staff very friendly so many things to do, swim at a number of pools, lagoon or beach. Can eat and drink at resort or close to Waikiki cafes, restaurants and shopping.Room was a standard room but spacious clean and well maintained. There are some towers that are more modern but all appear to be well maintained. Would recommend for families of all ages.","October 4, 2018"
Staff was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and accommodating! The ocean view was perfect for a relaxing cup of coffee first thing in the morning. Ali’i Pool was just what the doctor ordered with pool side drinks. Overall a vacation of a lifetime.,"October 4, 2018"
Everything you could ever want or need is at this beautiful resort. White sandy beaches every kind of shopping you could want and great Food. One of the most beautiful places I've stayed.Just a complete Paradise.,"October 4, 2018"
"From the valet to the housekeepers the stafff was always incredibly nice and helpful. I would strongly recommend signing up for the Hilton honors program as it gave us several perks that made our stay significantly better. Also, you can precheckin and request things straight through the APP. It is very convent.The resort itself is very pretty with great beach access. We signed up for some of the free hotel activities, like lei making that were fun and “free” (this is what your resort fee goest too.) There are lots of shops and resurants so there is no need to ever leave. The food is over priced, but that seems to be universally true at these types of resorts. We found access to The ABC stores especially nice as they had fair prices for food, drinks, stuff you forgot,and activities like snorkeling. The pool was excellent and there are lots of bars around to grab a drink which you can carry with you throughout the resort. The resort is huge but for the best expienece pay the extra and stay in the rainbow tower. See the attached picture of our view. It’s worth It. This is the best resort my wife and I have stayed at and we will definetly be back. 10/10!","October 4, 2018"

"We are booked at the Hilton Hawaiian Village as part of our NCL Cruise tour. They would not honor my Hilton Honors Diamond status since it’s considered a third party booking. After coming from the Sheraton Waikiki where my status was recognized and appreciated, it was incredibly disappointing to not even have Hilton say thanks for your loyalty at checkin. A little thank you goes a long way and they didn’t seem to care.The room we are in (Diamond Tower) faces one of the bar that has live music and it’s incredibly loud as well. The room is standard, but spacious. The Paradise pool was nice, but very crowded. Overall I’m not impressed with the service. The property is well maintained, but crowded. ","October 3, 2018"
Very unhelpful. I had to book several rooms for a group which is fine but they made me pay for each room separately. The end result was more fees from the bank. The rooms were so average esp for the price. Big queues everywhere.,"October 3, 2018"
"We went in the middle of September for 2 days prior to going on a Hawaiian Cruise around the islands. We have friends with teenage twin boys that swear by this place and come twice a year. Yes, this place is the village like no other.. Shops everywhere on property and beautiful no doubt. But very very crowded.. We stayed in the Ali'i tower which has its own private pool and concierge desk. It did help with the crowd until you left your tower.. It was the middle of September and still so crowded. They have fireworks and a show every Friday night. Now this was really nice but so crowded that you felt like you were at Disneyland. The next morning there was a Volleyball International Contest at the resort on the beach with vendors. Great for the teenagers who want to be apart of the excitement.. They had a celebration going on for the re boot of Magnum PI and Hawaii Five O show going on in the area. Lots going on and fun for the family if that's what you like. Not much peace and quiet..We ate dinner the first night at the Italian restaurant ""Fresco"". I do NOT recommend. I ordered buttered noodles for my allergy child who traveled all day. Terrible, cold she would not eat it. She said I would rather be hungry... Not a good sign. I ordered chicken Alfredo, super small portion and not very good. Point.,. Overpriced and Not worth it pass. Go to the ice cream shop and eat away your disappointment., Now that's the real score.Over all a wonderful short stay but filled with loud kids, lots of people and NO relaxation. But I have kids too. so I know next time I go. I most likely will not come again.. I like to relax and take in the vacation a bit. The staff was nice. The valet are rude and pushy all they want is a tip and to tell you that you can't check in and drop your bags.. Not good. They were the worst.They want to get their full hustle on and completely forgot about customer service.  The rooms in the Ail'i tower were well appointed and if you like the international toilets that are like your car wash.(Wash, dry and etc) Then this is your place. My 6 year old travels a lot and always have fun with that feature. I hope this helps those with kids. For breakfast we went to the Disney Aulani property for the Character breakfast which was a great time for the 6 year old. A must do.. Tip: Book the night before on the website for the Character Breakfast it saves you from calling them a million times trying to get a spot. We arrived and it was no one there so you may have to make the extra effort if you want the experience for your kids. Disney is always nice and accommodating Note it is about a 30-40 minute drive from the Hilton to the Aulani hotel and they stop serving breakfast with the characters ( Minnie, Mickey and Goofy) at 11:00 am. Have fun and Aloha...","October 3, 2018"
"good food, decoration spectacular, but the rooms not clean specialty the furniture. also is not have a natural beach. they were taping a program nickelonium and some places it were close to public. the pool need also more mantenient ","October 3, 2018"
"Hilton is located on the best part of Waikiki beach but resort is overcrowded and not up to a 4 star standards. Have been here before even as a child and it has gone downhill. Food is mediocre at restaurants and expensive. Place has gotten too big and impersonal. Main Rainbow Tower needs updating and they need an ""adults only"" pool as the place was overrun with little kids even in late September. Not the place to stay if you want a relaxing vacation. Even though there is no smoking in rooms, we could not go out on our balcony because someone in one of the rooms around us was puffing away and it blew right up to our room. Thankfully, the beach area is extensive and was out saving grace.","October 3, 2018"
"Everything in the village is a few steps away. It is a good alternative if you don't want to venture out into the city or even if you do. Plenty of shops and places to eat. A bit on the high end, but what would you expect staying at the Hilton!","October 3, 2018"
"only stayed for 1 day before a cruise and it's huge. Want stores, you got them, want Starbucks, it's there too. Have a great time and they had Fireworks too. On Friday night , Its right on the beach, plenty to do.","October 3, 2018"
"Remember that when you book and/or read reviews. It's.A.Resort. Now, with that being said, my review is as follows:Pros: 1. It's a resort, which means there is ALWAYS something to see, do, and eat. 2. Because it's a resort, there is tons of shopping on the property.3. It's a resort, so it's massive and you'll find tons of places to either seclude yourself or meet new people. 4. Fireworks show was pretty amazing - note: it only happens on Friday nights at the conclusion of the review show near the Super Pool.5. Hilton Honors check in is a breeze; sign up for it and you'll thank me later. (General check in looked like TSA check in at rush hour). I was slightly... no HIGHLY annoyed that there was a $450 ""incidentals"" fee upon check in that NO ONE told me about. I'm even more annoyed that we are 2 days post check out and it hasn't been refunded. Cons:1. It's a resort. That means it's crowded. There are literally THOUSANDS of rooms on this property. Remember that when booking. 2. Lack of communication between third party booking vendors. I was super annoyed to find that Delta Vacations (who sold me the booking) either lied or HHV lied. Either way, I didn't get what I paid for and I'll be taking that up with them directly. 3. It's a resort, so there may or may not be someone at your beck and call and you may have to wait. 4.The furniture (in the room in the rainbow tower) was dated and damaged. There was lime and such in the shower head and I killed a few cockroaches. Again, it's a MASSIVE resort and everyone isn't as clean as others. 5. Know the fine print: I was slightly... no HIGHLY annoyed that there was a $450 ""incidentals"" fee upon check in that NO ONE told me about. I'm even more annoyed that we are 2 days post check out and it hasn't been refunded. All in all, we had an amazing time, but I doubt that I'd stay at this property again. I wanted to give it 4 stars, but the fact that we:A: spent thousands to stay (on top of the fees)B: spent hundreds on a vow renewal and ""honeymoon package"" that doesn't ""exist""C: still haven't seen a foliohas turned me off.","October 3, 2018"

"I had a wonderful vacation here with a room in the Kalia tower. The room was clean and very comfortable with a beautiful view of the ocean. The housekeepers kept the room clean and well stocked. The beach, the pools and lagoon provided ample contact with water to keep cool. There were many great food choices and the numerous shops provided for great browsing and shopping.","October 2, 2018"
"We have stayed her twice, one without and once with kids. The facilities are great and an easy walk into Waikiki or the large ala Moana shopping centre. The car park does cost but it is close by and easy to navigate. I do wish all the rooms had some basic kitchen facilities. They do have a coffee machine but not a kettle. ","October 2, 2018"
"Room was always kept very cleqn and the tolietries were first class. The room was spacious. However the desk chair was well worn with holes on sides and arms. The beds felt narrow for queen beds and I would like to be able to remove the comforter from the bed. However the comforter was in a duvet so to remove the comforter was to remove the top sheet.The resort is enormous with several separate towers. I believe there are 23 eating establishments from facny to casual. Shopping for every need including several ABC stores for forgotten items. The ocean, lagoon and several pools all beautiful and very well maintained and staffed. Endless opportunity for activities in the resort or to book tours but remember it is a resort so activities will cost you additional to your daily resort fee (currently at $40. daily). There is little need to leave however if you wish to visit the city, city buses and trolleys are affordable.  ","October 2, 2018"

"We came here on the first stop on our 3 island hop 2 week honeymoon. We stayed in the Ali’i Tower which I HIGHLY recommend as a couple. The resort is busy, like the Disney world of Hawaii, we had terrible traffic coming in because of the high volume. The hotel has numerous towers, but the Ali’i was perfect! Your own concierge and check in which was great to skip the long lines of check in at main entrance. Room was gorgeous, beautiful ocean view and flatscreen TV, bathroom was so clean and nice! You can definitely tell it’s a newer tower.We received complimentary breakfast for using online check in! Was delicious and just what you need. The hotel is further up the main strip but just a beautiful 15 minute walk down the boardwalk. We stayed 3 nights and were able to hit the beach and our excursions very easily from here! Staff was super friendly and place is beautiful, just a big beautiful village! ","October 2, 2018"
"Waikiki is a busy and over populated holiday spot and the Hilton Hawaiian Village is an extension of that. While the accommodation and facilities are of a high standard the sheer size makes the experience quite sterile. There is no connection with staff because there are so many of them. They are all super friendly though. I also was horrified at the amount of single use plastic used across the island of Oahu. Big brand, high end hotels like the Hilton could be leaders in reducing their impact on the environment in which they make their money but there is absolutely no attempt to do this...this is not just a Hilton issue. I would love to see a brand like this get rid of plastic throw away cups poolside and invest in washable, reuseable items instead.","October 2, 2018"
"We stayed in Ali'i tower with ocean views and glad we did. This is a huge resort so having our own facilities, pool, bar, gym was fantastic and really glad we chose to pay the extra and stay in this option. We never had to fight for a sun lounge at the pool. It is situation on the quieter end of the beach with more sand to stretch out on. A short walk in to Waikiki town central. Very close to Ala Moana Shopping a bonus. I feel the lagoon pool does not have enough sun lounges and in the right location available to parents to monitor their kids on the slides.","October 2, 2018"
"Stayed in the Ali’i Tower for the amenities but really didn’t feel any special treatment. There’s plenty to do if you don’t want to venture off the resort and a couple of the bars are nice. The food was average at best and, naturally, at resort prices. Parking your car requires a second mortgage. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful, especially the valets - they have great tips of restaurants and things to do all around the island. Did the luau which to be honest was disappointing. Thought it would be on the beach but it was on top of the parking deck. The view was nice, the dancers were superb but the food was terrible. Our room was nice, quiet and tidied up nicely every day. Being a diamond member they did try to upgrade my room but I would have had to move towers and I wanted to be where it was quieter. I would give the room a 4, the staff a 5 and food a 1.","October 2, 2018"
"We booked a room in the Ali tower with an ocean view at least 12 months ago. We arrived at 7am and were told that our room was not ready until 3pm. Strangely enough they wouldn’t tell us which room or floor we were allocated!We could use the pool area on level 2 but had to take our suitcases up to main lobby for storage. We accessed the pool area as it was a very hot day and we had all our hand luggage to carry around. The level 2 pool area is a construction zone as they were finishing renovating the bar area and hot tub. The main work was being done on the ground floor rooms that were all boarded up with black rubber on the roof tops. We were met with the sound of jackhammer and drills and construction workers! They were also doing work on the roof of the bar and were laying waterproofing or something similar, not the nicest place to spend the day! We returned to reception at 2.30pm and were to loud room was ready, however it was on level 3! The balcony view was ruined by the black rubber everywhere and the furniture was old and dated. We observed other guests inspecting this room when were in the pool so I think they tried to sell it to anyone! Not the room we expected after booking 12 months ahead, arriving at 7am and being valued Hilton Honors members! We advised reception that we would not accept this room and wanted to move to a different building. We had to stay in that awful room one night and were then transferred to the Rainbow tower in a high floor corner room. This building has been renovated and the decor is much nicer. We enjoyed our 6 nights in this room and used the main pool. We were not compensated in any way for the inconvenience or different room rate, no discount vouchers, no free welcome drink not even a free newspaper. Only free wifi and we obtained a free paper from a nearby hotel every morning! The resort fees charged on top of the normal rate make it a very expensive stay so a little special treatment would be nice! The Friday night fireworks are great and the products in the bathroom are nice.","October 2, 2018"
"Having stayed with HHV before we thought it to be a good place to experience Waikiki again. We booked ten days. Our room in the Kalia Tower was fine--until we opened the lanai door. Directly over the roof of the convention center (20th floor) we were greeted by the 24/7 roar of about twenty rooftop air conditioning units and TRAFFIC on Ala Moana Blvd. We received a brochure explaining what we got for the $40 per night resort fee (extra) … basically 10% discounts off of products and services over priced and unwanted. The 22 acre property is now filled with towers and teeming with Japanese tourist … which is fine until you try to walk somewhere. They are used to staying on the left side, like at home, using cell phones and running into us constantly. Nothing against foreign tourists... Happy they're bringing new money to Hawaii. The fact that there are about twelve to one Help Desks for Japanese and Korean speakers to English tells the story. $75 for two Mai-tai's and a plate of coconut shrimp tells you the rest of it. We will not return.","October 2, 2018"
"Great property! Lots of amenities, restaurants, and numerous pools. Beautiful landscape, and in a great location, far enough from the bustle of Waikiki Beach, but close enough to still walk there as well","October 2, 2018"
"This review was a tough one for me because I had very mixed feelings about this hotel. The good, the beach near this hotel is one of the best stretches along Waikiki, for that alone I would go. The rooms are a bit outdated, but clean and comfortable so no complaints there. The location is good and within walking distance to many restaurants and other shops in Waikiki. Also walkable to the local mall. Many amenities on site which is nice, but it is sprawling so can be hard to navigate sometimes. The bad - this hotel is huge and VERY VERY crowded. Expect lines and long waits at all the restaurants during peak hours, and don't expect to get a lounge chair at the pool unless you go very early and stay all day. Also, the pools & hot tubs themselves were very crowded. Sign says max 10 people and no kids, and they are full to the rim of people 20 + people and kids. I did not want to go in. It cost an arm and leg to rent a beach chair and umbrella, but was much more pleasant to hang out there all day than in the pools so I recommend that despite the cost. Overall I would recommend for the location and beach, but if you hate Disney like crowds - you will want to book somewhere else.","October 2, 2018"
"Hotel was great. Many choices for pools, restaurants, and shopping. You could spend a week here and never leave the property. Great concierge that helped us set up a dinner cruise and a Pear Harbor visit along with best way to get to Diamond Head.","October 2, 2018"
Disappointed with the hotel room. Paid for Ocean view but got a lagoon view with partial Ocean view. Too tired from my trip at that point to argue.Besides the place is very crowded since it was summertime. Places to eat around the area are very expensive. Been in Waikiki so many times but Outrigger waikiki by the beach is better and price are reasonable. Lots of places to see and are all walking distance. Not to mention Dukes restaurant is just downstairs with the best Hawaiian food ever.,"October 2, 2018"
Terrible. Room was great ocean view from The Ocean Tower. But ocean tower has 2 circular ring of rooms- no restaurant in the complex Sun - Thur;Only 2 restaurant on entire property!!!!! You take a train they have 2 but only 1 runs. It takes 20 minutes to get to the other side of the property - Better to go off property ( you need a car)Pool a bad. - the main pool has been closed 2+ months ( along with its restaurant). The Adult pool is nice but no bar service Ocean tower has only 2 elevators. If you want to access the other pools - you have walk. We would never stay here again,"October 2, 2018"
A well appointed hotel with good facilities and staff. The only negative on this property was the bathroom. Definite signs of mound on the inside of the vanity and silicone falling away from the shower.,"October 1, 2018"
"We stayed in the Tapa Tower and had a great view of the beach. The room was clean and tidy and serviced daily. We were travelling outside school holidays but that didn't seem to make a difference. We have nothing against kids, but were on a couples holiday so like a pool that is a little quieter. First day went to pool and it was so busy people were literally diving on sun loungers to get one. We went for cocktails instead :-) we asked the waitress if there was an adults only pool and she told us of the pool on level 4 of one of the towers that not many people knew about. Investigation proved her correct and each afternoon we enjoyed being poolside in a quieter environment. Great location for walking to main street for restaurants and shopping. Really helpful staff.","September 30, 2018"
"Cannot beat the view of the ocean and Diamond Head. Our room was a little dated and had repair work needed on the wall near the television. That being said, I’d stay here again and again if I were coming back to Hawaii. Shopping within a nice walk from the hotel and food options too. ","September 30, 2018"
Arrived late but were given No1 service . area is spacious lush and inviting . ecommerce right outside the hotel . Local transit is cheap and effcient. many resturants and small market next door loved it,"September 30, 2018"
"Stayed for 5 nights. Room was bit old, moved the room to rainbow tower which facing the ocean and room condition was even better. Got 20$ credit as a hilton gold member. Enjoyed at starbucks in the resort and the breakfast buffet. ","September 30, 2018"
"Stayed here 6 nights and didn't want to leave. Stayed in the A'ili Tower and it was great. From the super efficient check in staff to our check out, couldn't fault any of our dealings with staff. Always helpful. Would certainly be my first choice resort in Honolulu.","September 29, 2018"
Nancy at the front desk is awesome! I called the day before and she was able to give us our room information to make check in easier. There was a pre check in lady with a tablet that’ll take information and call you once your room is ready. Then there’s a pre check in line but only had a few people before us. We only waited about 20-30 minutes total with checking in. Fireworks on the beach was cool. Show up around 6:00 when they start roping off the area so you can be front row. The resort fee gives you basic stuff like WiFi that most other hotels give for free. ,"September 29, 2018"
"We stayed here for 10 days as part of our honeymoon and the resort itself is really good however our room was a bit dated which was disappointing considering how much we paid. We were in the Tapa tower with a partial sea view and we were impressed with the view we had. If we were to go back, we’d look at upgrading when booking to one of the more expensive towers such as the Rainbow Tower.","September 29, 2018"
"We stayed in an oceanfront room in the rainbow tower on the 6th floor. I was worried being on the sixth floor, that the view might not be so great, but it was perfect. We could see the ocean and beach, the activities people were up to on the beach and Diamond head. We could easily view the fireworks perfectly from the balcony. The room was spacious, bathroom and facilities were adequate. The lifts sometimes would get a little congested, but still efficient. I liked the availability of DVD’s and free classes. We did a lei making class with fresh orchids. Miss 6yo loved camp penguin and went on one of the excursions for one of the days she attended. Don’t come to this hotel looking for a cheap holiday. Everything costs, but it’s just so easy and available at the hotel. I arrived on an early flight, and the hotel was able to accommodate me with an early check in that I had not previously arranged. It was an additional fee, but I’m glad I did as later on the check in line was lengthy and was a long process. Overall I couldn’t image staying anywhere else in Waikiki. Definitely the best family friendly hotel in Waikiki.","September 28, 2018"
"I had a side view in the Rainbow Tower, from the 10th floor. Breathtaking. I enjoyed the view of the lagoon, the ocean and the city. I would choose to stay in that room again if given the opportunity. I enjoyed that there was so much for me to see.","September 28, 2018"
"This is our third time staying at this resort, we love it and have no complaints about the hotel itself, but their check in/check out policy is really inconsiderate to guests. We checked out at 11, got a notification that our flight was delayed by 6 hours, and instead of wandering the hotel for the remainder of the time, we asked (and were more than willing to pay extra) for one extended night. I know they offer late check out until 6pm according to their website, but when I asked the front desk they said no, nothing we can do..mind you we were visiting during a non peak season, there were empty rooms all around us, sometimes felt like we had the entire floor to ourselves even, so I doubt they had another guest assigned to our room already, especially since they don’t even allow check in until 3pm (unless you pay them another ridiculous fee), and it was barely 11:30 am at this time. We literally just checked out not 45 minutes ago, the room hadn’t even been serviced yet, but they could not offer us our room back for a few hours? Even after telling them I am more than willing to pay the extra $175 fee for late check out (which is extremely expensive already). All in all we had a good stay, but the unwillingness of the staff was kind of a bummer, they really should be more considerate since this resort is already not cheap, we payed close to 2 grand to stay here, and were even willing to pay more just for a few extra hours in our room. I sometimes think the staff doesn’t realize that people travel up to 12+ hours just to come to Hawaii, so penalizing people just so we can check in early, or check out late is really ridiculous. Might stay here next time, might not..","September 28, 2018"
"Given my screen name for Trip Advisor, you'd probably guess that I know a thing or two about Honolulu and in particular, Waikiki hotels and resorts. I've actually lost track of how time I've been to Honolulu it's always vibrant bustling Waikiki district. I actually decided to give The Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort a try this recent visit. Keep in mind that this resort complex is huge! It has five towers of rooms for all budgets and a few pools spread out over it's twenty twoish acres. There is also a nice collection of small shops and restaurants on the property to choose from. Overall, I felt that the property was well maintained but the check in counter and even the bars were understaffed! This is especially disappointing given the ridiculous cost of even the breakfast buffet! More staffing at the check in counters and restaurants and bars on the property is a must fix especially at peak times! The adequate sized room that my wife and I had in the Diamond Head tower was clean and reasonably up to date. If you are family with grade school aged children then this resort would be a good choice for you. I felt that this resort is definitely geared for families but not a great choice for a couples romantic get away, as it is too busy with people coming and going everywhere and too many small children.","September 28, 2018"
"Let me start by saying that the Time Shares are great. We’ve been going for about 4 or 5 years now. My husband and I are in the two bedroom suite with my son and his family of 6(Kids range from 10-17), a cousin and her family of 3 along with various other relatives that share another 2 BR with them.The rooms are spacious, and the kitchen is an added plus. Especially with a large group. We can cook some meals and go out to enjoy some meals in Waikiki.This year was the first time we rented a water toy out in the lagoon. We had a blast taking turns. We got to try this huge water tricycle type thing that you peddle and the kids used a kayak. I can not recommend this enough.I highly recommend staying here and if you do, go play in the Lagoon!","September 28, 2018"
"I will start this review by stating that the resort is beautiful and even with the issues we encountered, the customer service we received was prompt, pleasant and exemplary.The issues: old, ragged, motel standard furniture (see photos); first room was ocean view (as opposed to the ocean front room we reserved and paid a premium for) and I had to debate the definition of ocean front before my room was changed; the soap dish fell off the wall while I was showering; the shower head in the 2nd assigned room was unstable and kept falling off its setting and the refrigerator wasn’t getting cold and had to be replaced to keep my meds at a cool temperature.The resort has a few towers so I’m not sure if we were housed in the most dated (Rainbow) tower, but I would suggest requesting modern amenities when making a reservation. Given the amount we spent ($420USD/ night) to celebrate our wedding anniversary, my expectation was to receive topnotch accommodations and unfortunately this property did not meet my expectations.","September 28, 2018"
"I’m reviewing this property from the perspective of a 50 plus year old couple, using a report card like grading system, I’ve rated my experiences A-F below:A1. Hotel employees at check in housekeeping and phone from room customer service staff. All were exceptionally friendly and helpful; top notch. We wanted for not and were greeted with warm friendly and prompt responsiveness the few times we reached out. A2. Transportation to and from offsite Luau options was also exceptional. A3. Extra perks/gifts left in room by staff to please. (Mystery fun, not telling) A4. Quality and view from room for price per night. We had a beautiful view of the ocean and Diamond Head. We had a fair sized room with a very comfortable king sized bed and balcony. We had robes and slippers waiting, a 40 inch flat panel tv, granite counter tops, a coffee maker, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, mini fridge and safe. A shower tub in the modern bathroom with an assortment of shampoos and soaps were also available. All for a very fair price for under $500 per night.A5. Right on the beach!B1. Hotel amenities were abound. Restaurants, pool, lagoon, lounge bar with live entertainment, Luau and other entertainment options. A barber shop on site, lots of shopping (mall like) car rental and a beauty salon. You can take surfing or swim lessons. We could have stayed on the property the entire week wanting for not (although we did).B2. Proximity to a Costco and many other off site shopping, beach and marina environments. B3. Hotel Safety. Although our vehicle was broken into at the local Costco, right in front of the gas station in broad day light, we felt very safe and secure on the hotel property. The noted and visible presence of hotel security should have tipped us off. Do not leave anything in your vehicle if you park off site at beaches, shopping centers or restaurants. It seems to be common knowledge this is a high crime area. B4. Dining on site was spendy and enjoyable, but venturing off the property yielded more fun in dining.***In Summary, this was a very enjoyable property and the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome as honored and valued guests. We will stay here again without question and give it my sincere recommendation.","September 27, 2018"
"The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a large, virtually self-contained resort community. The staff (front desk, housekeeping, concierge) are excellent, as its the location (next to Fort DeRussy) and the shopping. It is a very busy resort, however, and the traffic (taxis and other vehicles) can be a little off putting. The resort fees are also relatively high. That said, I would stay here again in the future.","September 26, 2018"
We stayed at the Hilton in Oahu it was a beautiful hotel with so much on site the food is expensive and you can get cheaper food if you leave the resort but the pools are excellent along with the beach which is at the hotel We loved everything about the resort the room was lovely big and clean and well positioned The whole resort was clean and so pretty with all the waterfalls and ponds around the resort A must for anyone thinking of coming to Honolulu,"September 26, 2018"
"We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort Waikiki in the Tapa tower for 6 nights in a standard room then again later for 2 nights in a corner suite. The decor was dark, old & dated and the furniture needs a good clean. There were plenty of stains on the dining chairs, couch & single chair. The hotel does not provide complimentary bottled water or bathroom amenities such as tooth brushes, cotton buds, etc. They provide soap, shampoo, conditioner & moisturizer. I was disappointed as the previous Hilton properties we have stayed in were bright, clean & modern & provided extra amenities & bottled water. Check in was a crazy event. Up to 40+ people in lines to check in. Our Friends stayed in the Outrigger Reef resort which is smaller & more boutique. They received a complimentary welcome drink, cool towels on arrival and were seated whilst checking in & explained the facilities. Their rooms had bathroom amenities such as cotton buds, tooth brushes, bath robes, bottled water & more. They also received a welcome gift & take home calendar plus more. Their accommodation was much cheaper yet offered a great deal more. If you want better service & value for money don’t stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort. The ABC shops were well stocked so you could buy bottled water, food, gifts & snacks & any items you had forgotten to pack. Don’t rely on the Hilton Name brand to give you modern, clean & bright rooms or bottled water. Add the cost of accommodation & resort fees together and it’s an expensive stay for very little in return. They were more interested in selling you time share apartments. Not sure what the attraction to stay there was ........... No intention of ever returning to this property ever.","September 26, 2018"
"If you don't have a clue where to go, this is a good bet. It's expensive and everything is done so that you can spend more on the site but great pools and a great beach. I wouldn't stay too long in Waikiki there's way better on Maui and Kauai.","September 26, 2018"
"good. nice, comfortable. not that good location for surfing. i can see lagoon pool in my room. 다음에 가면 와이키키비치에 있는 힐튼 가야지.. 여긴 느누 복잡해. ㅠㅠ 얼음은 층마다 비치되잇음. 리조트 안에 생각보다 맛집이 많음. 호놀룰루쿠키도 있고, 좋다~ 쉬러 간다면 .ㄱㅊ 나는 돌아가니는거 조아해ㅛㅓ...","September 26, 2018"
"I knew I was gambling, but booked anyway because I found a “half off suites” special. Not being a big fan of mega resorts, I thought the discount would make up for the long walks thru the resort, dodging conventioneers, bachelorettes and lost tourists to get to a pool, the beach, or a restaurant. Nope! “Suite”, a 1 bedroom located in the Tapa Tower, was outdated but clean, and certainly not worth paying full price for. Restaurants were, as expected in a resort of this size, crowded, overpriced, and unremarkable.","September 26, 2018"
"I stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village mid September with a friend. Overall impression it was a very nice self contained resort. With that being said it was also very busy. As they have the hotel itself and also time shares located there too. The staff was friendly and the rooms were good. The only real negative comment I have is most of Waikiki beach is about a mile or so down the beach, but the value of staying there makes up for it. There is enough options for food and entertainment, to where one doesn't have to leave the grounds if they don't want to.","September 26, 2018"
"We stayed in an ocean view room in the Tapa tower. it was a nice stay and the hotel itself is good but its a huge resort, if you're happy with that then this is the hotel for you, lost of conveniences mean you dont have to leave the hotel if you dont want to.there a decent happy hour at the bars and lots of conveniences.","September 26, 2018"
"Checking in and out fairly chaotic. We stayed in Rainbow tower looking onto lagoon and room was clean but very tired and could do with refurb.Eating on site very expensive at $80 for two at breakfast, but plenty of local dining restaurants.Fireworks are fantastic on Friday and book early for tickets to Arizona memorial.At the end of every trip, we reflect on wether we would go back to Hawaii and the answer is, ABSOLUTELY. Would we stay at Hilton? Maybe, we would look elsewhere.","September 25, 2018"
"My wife and I stayed in the Rainbow Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel on Waikiki Beach. A very busy check in area with long lines by mid-day. Good to be a Hilton Honors member here. There have great fireworks on Friday, that can be seen from (only from the oceanside rooms) the Rainbow Tower. Great location at the NW end of Waikiki Beach, close to the Port of Honolulu. The rooms are good sized yet the furnishings are a bit worn. The staff is warm and friendly.","September 25, 2018"
"My friend and I were on a business/vacation trip together and she booked us a room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Our room was clean and a great size, beds were SUPER comfortable and the bath products smelled like you expect Hawaii to smell!! Papaya and Coconut!!! YUMMMM!!!We had a great partial ocean view facing Diamond Head in the Tapas Tower. Our tower was easy to get to and centrally located. We had 1 issue...the air conditioning would only go down to 68 and our room felt humid. We called the front desk and a maintenance guy came and looked but what we were told is 68 is the lowest limit. He didn’t know what to do about it feeling damp. The shipping is fabulous, the Tropics Bar is the BEST place to hang out, listen to music, people watch and eat!! Try a Hula Girl for sure!! The size of the beach cannot be beat AND you can take your drinks down there because it is all part of the Hilton grounds. You will have a marvelous, relaxing vacation!! ","September 24, 2018"
"My partner and I stayed at this resort for a week from 27 July to 3 August 2018. Upon the checkout we were told that everything is paid for and we have no further charges, but then later I discovered a USD 300 charge on my credit card. I inquired with the Finance department of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, and was told that this is the resort fee that should be collected from all guests. I checked my itinerary from Booking.com and it says that the resort fee was included in the payment made via Booking.com. I explained that to the Finance lady in Hilton, however she kept stating that this is a mandatory payment. I am really disappointed with 3 things:- noone told us at the check-in or check out that we had to pay anything extra; and- more importantly we paid this resort fee twice;- upon following up with the Finance department at Hilton, the response was 'well check your itinerary', which by the say states that this fee was already paid by us.I would like management to read this and escalate this internally within Hilton as it may indicate a process failure within Hilton, whereby customers are charged twice.","September 24, 2018"
"We were offered a five night stay including all taxes and resort fees, a dinner luau,and up to $200 off a Hilton brand stay in the next 6 months for around $700, if we would go to a presentation describing their time share program. We accepted as we were booked on the Pride of America cruise and stayed at the HHV before Boarding our cruise ship. It is very large and had many options for families. It was easy to get tours that picked up at the hotel and we took an Uber ride to some nearby sites. We enjoyed meals and service and nightly entertainment at Tropics right on the hotel beach. Also enjoyed the nightly music at the Tappas Bar. Lappert’s had wonderful sorbet, ice cream, baked goodies, and coffee drinks. The juice cafe makes good açaí bowls. We went next door to the Illikai Hotel for good reasonable grilled fish dinner as well.Our only negative is that you literally had to rent a chaise if you only wanted to swim in a pool a short time as there was no place to put your stuff: no tables or chairs. We frequent resorts and have never encountered this anywhere else. We don’t sun but take a morning swim.Our room was clean and comfortable in the Tapa Tower. We had a problem where the air conditioner started dripping in the middle of the night. Two engineers came promptly and drained it and came back up he next morning to fix it. At no time were we without air conditioning. Charley’s Taxi Service operates right from the main lobby and is an excellent convenient inexpensive option to and from airport or pier with flat rates for 1-4 people","September 24, 2018"
"Just look at the sad pictures, I paid about $500.00 per night for an ocean view with diamond head view and the room was pathetic. I would have been better off in a 1 star hotel. I was told the room was due for remodel. I was told that management would call me back since I feel ripped off and want some form of a refund. No one returned my call!!!. First time stay at hilton, travel about 12 times per year and I was extremely disapointed in lack of service. - line for non hilton members an hour long-once at check in desk took over 30 minutes to process-see stains on furniture-see pathetic view of diamond head, 99% blocked-see trashed door-only 1 TOWEL PER PERSON AT POOLSTILL WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO CONTACT ME TO ADDRESS MY CONCERNSI WAS IN ROOM 1731 TAPA CONFIRMATION #3466661609","September 24, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaian Village Our family of five travelled to the beautiful Oahu for our spring vacation. We chose the Hilton Hawaian Village as our resort of choice because we were looking for a family destination with the right mix of kids and adult activities. In this sense our expectations were fully met. The resort did not disappoint in terms of kids activities and location. The resort is made up of a number of different towers, each with it's own pool facilities and amenities. Guests are able to make use of the various different pool areas so the variety is great. The location also has a lagoon which is teeming with little fish and was a delight for my kids. There are fun water activities at the lagoon such as paddle skis and giant paddle boats. The hotel room had absolutely stunning views of the ocean. However, I do believe that the suites need a upgrade as the decor is outdated and slightly worn out.We chose to book our excursions through the hotel. We opted for a full day tour of the Island and a half day tour of Hanama bay. Both these tours were great. It gave us a good sense of the culture and beauty of this wonderful Island. If you are looking for a great family holiday, this one delivers.","September 24, 2018"
"This is by far the best located hotel in Waikiki, It is right on the beach which is quite large, the village comprises of several hotel towers with the rainbow tower being nearest to the beach, there are several restaurants and bars on site, they are a bit pricey though. There is a lagoon attached to the hotel which is great for the kids and the main beach is surprisingly not crowded, our room had a fantastic view of Diamond head and the beach and it was well presented, Firework shows happen every Friday night about 7 30 at this time of year.Staff are all very pleasant and cannot do enough for you, Top tip, cocktails and drinks are cheaper if you leave the hotel complex.","September 23, 2018"
The room I had been allocated as a diamond member was poor. The furniture was peeling and the wall had a hole that was patched up but not done very well. The views from the room are amazing though. There are so many people and kids in this resort which makes it extremely busy. Staff needs more training with customer service. Diamond benefit for breakfast is a $10 voucher- the bare minimum they can offer. A stickling point also is the resort fee they charge- this should just be incorporated in their room rate! I spoke to their guest relations manager who did a great job of listening and he tried to rectify the concerns raised. I'm not too sure though I would ever come back here as I feel there are other better resorts in the area who offer value for money and who certainly value loyalty.,"September 22, 2018"
"Had an early check in at 12 to beat the rush, reception was helpful for this very tired traveller.Really appreciated: Reception leaving the desk and pointing me in the right direction for the tower, it is busy place with lots of people coming and going.Cleaners always taking the time to acknowledge me walking past and saying Aloha. As a Hilton Honours member, I just missed the sales dates, this was recognised and gifted buffet breakfast which was more than the value of the lost savings :) Some other travellers in this tower mentioned music from the neighbouring hotel. Approx 5-8 pm Sunday and Wednesday night, we sat outside on the balcony and considered it predinner entertainment, not too loud to have a conversation. With the doors shut you could barely hear the music. room 1391, parts of the room were quite new, curtains, bath, chairs, other parts need a little refresh - as below Opportunity to improve: its the little things that would take little to fix, a scratch on the TV cabinet, 1 second with a crayon no one would notice. One of the clips were pulled out of the curtain, that's a one minute job to repair to keep the room from looking tatty. The bus depot connection is chaotic it needs staff or tour desks to direct people where to wait.Looking forward to the next visit","September 22, 2018"
"The rooms are large and well looked after, clean, but the resort is tired and well past its best. Living on a past reputation. Reception is extremely busy with large queues at most times. Staff are helpful and pleasant but in bars they seem understaffed in the waiting staff. Slow to get service.","September 22, 2018"
"For me, when I booked at this property, I was expecting to have an upscale, modern and clean room. It was expensive and for me, I want quality. The room was partially water facing. Not what I expected when I booked. The website implies full views of the ocean. The sunset was beautiful though!I stayed in the Rainbow Tower. Room 2114. The room itself was meh. The carpet was old and could have used a cleaning. The furniture had seen better days 15 years ago. The bed wasn’t that comfy and the bedding wasn’t all that fancy. Something (a stain unidentifiable body fluid) was splashed onto the wall. The room could have used a good and modern renovation. Even the windows needed a cleaning. One plus was the bathroom. Its the little things really.The property itself is nice. You can’t get any closer to the beach. Front desk people were helpful. Staff seemed happy and professional despite having to work outside in the heat of summer.I’m not sure I’d return to this place. If I’m going to pay, I want more. I want updated, clean and modern. But for others, you might have not problem with this hotel.","September 22, 2018"
"First off. Would give zero stars if possible. This is a very expensive place. My wife and I spent 8 days here. Totalling over 3,500 just for the room. We have spent over 5,000 in all the affiliates inside the Village. Last night before we leave. We book the fireworks dinner cruise at 1:30 for a final dinner on the island. Nobody sends in the reservation. So we get there 20 minutes before time to check in and the boat is fully booked and we are not on board. They only want to comp 1 entre'e at a place that has a hour wait time and is by far the least desirable place to eat in the village. Dont waste the money to stay hoping for a amazing place to stay or eat. There are far better and nicer places to stay in the area with better service. The Hilton in Kauai Hawaii. A very much smaller hotel/resort but far better service and personal staffing.","September 21, 2018"
"OMG I will stay here every time I visit this beautiful Island. We stayed in the rainbow tower and the views were amazing, rooms were tidy, housekeeping was awesome and our 3 kids loved the variety with 6 pools in the village to choose from. Absolutely amazing. Will return","September 21, 2018"
"The view from the Rainbow Tower ocean front room was fantastic. You are able to see all of the fireworks show from this room and also have fantastic views of diamond head and sunrises. Check in was fast, check out was fast. All interaction with the staff was great and this hotel is in a great location to explore Honolulu. There is a store called ABC on the hotel property where you can buy alcohol and food for normal prices.","September 21, 2018"
"A typically decent, though very large, Hilton resort. Friendly staff, good pools and the beach is pretty nice too. Well located. Breakfast buffet is ok, a good selection but not the highest quality I’ve experienced in Hilton hotels ","September 21, 2018"
"Recently stayed at Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel, upon arrival amazed at size of it and all the restaurants and shops on offer. Dig a little below the surface, and you get to know the reality. We stayed in Rainbow Tower, the rooms are quite dated, and we found being on 23rd floor, good for views, but often took long time to get up and down elevators due to numerous stops at each floor. The resort fees are high, and be aware that to use a beach umbrella, chair or even the lagoon bikes, canoes all cost extra and aren’t covered in resort fees. Eating at any of the onsite restaurants will be costly, very simple meals will easily cost you $80 and above...I suggest you leave premises and cross the roads..McDonald’s is close by. Another disappointment is the pools and lagoon. The lagoon smells like a still body of water, like a lake..even though it appears to get drained partly each night, there is a smell to it, and the pools with waterslide is essentially shaded and gets limited sun due to the height of surrounding buildings. The actual beach that is promoted as private for guests also very rocky and painful to walk at waters edge...this is not the case further down the beach away from the Hawaiian village property. Overall an ok resort, but overrated. I have no doubts other properties in the area would be better. Fireworks every a Friday night are great and free.","September 20, 2018"
"Hotel is very old and outdated and in desperate need of a refurbishment. The bathroom door didn’t even close in our room. We arrived a little early, the hotel staff advised us our room was ready however if we wanted to check in early it was 75US. Obviously after traveling for 12 hours you don’t want to wait around for 4 hours. We have stayed in many Hilton hotels world wide and never had an issue with early check in and it’s always complimentary. I have bookings with the Hilton group and have now cancelled and re booked with another more accommodating hotel group. The rooms are old and dated someone’s pills were lying on the floor from person before us, breakfast was a rip off and so was the parking. Stay somewhere else if this is one of your choices.

"With its many restaurants, variety of rooms, large swimming pool, groomed beach, multitude of shops, perfect location, and interesting shows, the Hilton Hawaiian is a lovely resort. You can spend all your time in the resort or walk a short distance to the many other attractions of Waikiki. It is certainly worth a try,","September 19, 2018"
"Impeccable!!!!! Double balcony, wake up looking at Diamond Head and Wiakiki! Four swimming pools with one that has slides, in e slide goes into a “mountain”. Never really left the resort. So many restaurants to choose from and every one was above expectations.","September 19, 2018"
"I've been to The Hilton Hawaiian Village twice, once in 82 and again in 2015. It is a bit pricier than other hotels/resorts in Waikiki/Honolulu, but with 22 acres of resort on The widest stretch of beach in Waikiki and absolutely stunning views of the ocean, the marina, the lagoon, and Diamond Head, no other location can match what The Hilton Hawaiian Village offers. Great restaurants on site, a pizza parlor, coffee shops, deli's a Dairy Queen, Benihana, and an IHOP directly across the street and a McDonald's a two block walk, and GIVE different towers, The Hilton Hawaiian Village has EVERYTHING a traveller will need INCLUDING two convenience stores on site and pick-up and drop-off locations for tours. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is the ONLY place I would stay in Honolulu","September 19, 2018"
"We came to this hotel for our honeymoon trip and unfortunately didn't feel very special. The staff was cranky and unwelcoming. Any questions we had weren't answered with kindness, we actually felt like we were annoying the people who worked there. The charm of the property is no longer what it once was, it now feels incredibly corporate and cold. I'm not dumb, I get that you want our money but now it feels like that's all it's about is how much money we can milk you for. For how much we spent I would expect 5 star service and we received 1 star service. Definitely didn't feel like how a honeymoon trip should. It doesn't take much to make guests feel special and this hotel went above and beyond to make us feel bothersome. Will not be returning to this hotel any time soon.","September 19, 2018"
"We called twice and told them the bath tub was over floating but they never send anyone to fixed it. The hotel has many pools which great for kids, other than that the hotel is not new. The check in line always long even all counters were open. The most amazing thing was the Friday fireworks and it was special to me. Their self parking is nightmare, so you might just pay $50 for valet park to save time.","September 19, 2018"
i stayed here with my daughter and the location is great. Beach front and many pools. She loved the lagoon pool with slides however don’t rush to get there early as the slides don’t open till 10:00sm. We stayed in the rainbow tower and the rooms were the largest I’ve seen in Wakiki ( this was my 5 visit) so I’ve stayed in a few! Very modern and very clean. The staff are friendly.I was however disappointed when I asked room service if they could please provide me with a wine glass they advised that they didn’t have that service available! I also needed a spoon as I had brought my daughter a tub of ice cream and had nothing for her to eat it with and they advised that I would have to jo to their mini mart downstairs. Not the best customer service to me.I understand that it’s a very large resort but they need to update the size of their beach towels that they provide.Overall I would stay there again just those few little things would of made it a great experience.The photo is from our room on the 3rd floor. Nice!,"September 19, 2018"
I dont have any complaints about this resort. My stay was well worth it. Everything is infront of you and in waking distance. You can't go wrong for a family of four. For some who have never experienced the high tech toliet seats you will have an experience. This is not standard on the east and west coast. The women will love it and some men. The seat is always warm and you have several water spray options. The water is warm also. To top it off it blows you dry. We stayed in the Kalia Tower. Pics are from a double bed and pullout sofa. The beds are comfortable also. ,"September 19, 2018"
"I rounded up and gave 5 Stars, but probably a 4.5.....but overall a great stayWe stayed in Ali’i Tower and I would highly recommend if you are staying at this property for two reasons:1. They have their own private check-in whereas other towers have to go to main check-in. For anybody who has stayed here, that line is enormous....and we had zero wait at Ali’i. Property really needs to figure out a way to fix main check-in2. Ali’i has their own private pool with a bar and fitness center. Now we like the big properties and used Main Pool a lot but it was nice to have our own little hideaway.As would be expected in Hawaii, it is expensive. There are a ton of on-site places to eat, but if you had a family of 4 and ate all 3 meals here, you could easily go thru $ 1,000/ DAY. If you are looking for a casual alternative for a breakfast or lunch, get some sandwiches at one of the two ABC Stores....nothing special but certainly did the trick. We ate dinner on site 4 times and all were good, but, again, expensive. Only issue we had is our server was rushing us at Tropics and threw out a half finished meal that we wanted to take back to room for later. While she was apologetic, no credit was offered for tossing out half of our meal. When we complained, the Manager (I am assuming) was defiant and she was completely obnoxious.Other than the aforementioned Manager, we found the workers here EXTREMELY polite and genuinely interested in the enjoyment of our stay. Moreover, everyone we met was eager to help us out with some advice on areas to visit around the island.If drinking, there are three happy hours that I would consider checking out....Tropics, Tapa, and one on far side of property whose name I forget. Again, like food, drinks are pricey but if you go to happy hours, you can save a bundle.For those first timers, this property is one of the few in Waikiki that is actually on the beach...most are not. I think this is a HUGE reason as to why to select this property. Last thing I wanted to do is walk across a city street because I forgot the suntan lotion in the room.Again, I highly recommend this property and if I return to Honolulu, I will stay here again !","September 19, 2018"
"The resort has 8 towers which makes the resort very busy out of season nevermind in season. They also hire a lot of areas out to private parties limiting your choice. They also allow public access around the resort leaving limited pool availability for those staying at the hotel. There's a hotel only pool but all the pools are very small and sun beds are cramped together. The room we stopped in was expensive yet it was stuck in the 80s! Very dated and can hear people in the other rooms. We paid the same per night in the centre of Vegas and the hotel was amazing! Also close hotels around the same price are modern and enjoyable! We made a mistake booking this hotel! We paid for partial ocean view which you could only see when you stood by the railing. Also when booking event tickets we were persuaded to watch a ""presentation"" on the new tower to save $200. This turned out to be a 2 hour time share consultation which they want a decision on the spot and your very pressurised into it. Luckily we said no, especially after reading other reviews! Stay away from that! No fault with the staff and service at the restaurants but the hotel it's self is very poor! Also it's location is a 30 min walk to the actual centre of the town. We won't be stopping in Hilton again! ","September 18, 2018"
"First off, yes the checkin lines are busy but what else would you expect from a resort of this size and capacity? At least they have staff standing close by to help direct you to where you need to be. The older, white haired gentleman attendant even came and grabbed my husband and son so that he could show our little boy a lizard while I waited in the checkin line. I wish I’d gotten his name so I could say thanks for those precious few minutes he took to entertain our son. We booked a partial ocean view room and were super impressed to find we’d been upgraded to an amazing ocean view. The room had a nice big king bed which fit myself, husband and our son so there was no need for an extra rollaway bed. Oh and the bed was so comfortable to sleep in.Housekeeping did a spectacular job of keeping it clean each day and always with a smile too. They always found a few seconds of time to stop and say hello to our little man which always made him laugh in his toddler way. They were also very honest as I’d left our safe door wide open one day and our passports, my jewellery and all our cash was left untouched.Maintenance had to come up one night when the water diverter on the bath tub snapped but Dale was fantastic and got the whole bath tub spout replaced in a jiffy so that we could use the shower again. We even managed to have a short little chat during which he told us a little more about the island and it’s residents/weather which we found very useful. Thank you DaleI agree that the carpets are a little dated but that’s a tiny thing amongst everything else that this hotel has to offer.The lagoon is the perfect place to laze around and watch the little one as he splashes around in the nice shallow, still lagoon waters.I packed our own beach towels for the trip so we had no need to hire the towels from the resort. Shade was easily found under the trees beside the lagoon so no umbrellas needed there.There are plenty of food and drink venues around the resort but our standout meal was from the Bali Steak & Seafood restaurant underneath the rainbow tower. Coffee’s from Lappert’s were surprisingly good though not as strong as I usually drink despite the double shot.There are also some yummy food offerings down at the ABC store which you can take back to your room as well as dry goods, cup noodles, drinks (both non alcoholic k alcoholic) and everything else you could think off. Just bring your own bag as the stores around the island operate on a bagless system so there is a small charge if they need to provide you with a plastic store bag. The lifts can get quite busy so factor that in if you need to be downstairs at a set meeting time. There are plenty of shops around the resort and the Ala Moana centre is just a 15 minute walk away.For anyone wanting to save money on taxis/ubers/buses, I’d recommend you buy a Waikiki Trolley pass so that you can just hop on/off whenever you want as this trolley goes to most places. There are two trolley stops just outside the hotel.Be sure to hold onto your ABC store receipts as you can redeem them at the end for a free gift.Thank you Hilton Hawaiin Village❤️One day we will be back!!","September 18, 2018"
"This was a great place to stay. You never have to leave the resort or as they call it the village. It really is a small village with many stores , beach, restaurants, pools, snorkel,and beach walks. Make sure to do the polenisen luau as it is the best. You play games and get leis as well. Great food. It’s the time you want to leave the village. ","September 18, 2018"
"My husband and I originally had a Friday night booking as part of our cruise package; while we couldn’t add a night to the reservation, we made a separate reservation for Thursday. When we checked in, the helpful employee said we could keep the same room - and upgraded us to a partial oceanview! Our first night was in the Tapa Tower on the 22nd floor. Decent room. Lots of shops and restaurants on resort property, and right near the beach!The second day, we worked out at the gym in another tower, which was a nice facility and surprisingly busy! We went back to shower and the shower only gave out hot water! It made my foot hurt! So my husband called and ended up speaking to a manager, Kevin I think his name was. The first couple of offers weren’t satisfactory (taking all my shower stuff to a different room in a different tower wasn’t convenient, and we didn’t have time to use spa passes). Thankfully he came up with a solution to put us in a different tower that had working showers. He had a bellboy collect our luggage and take us to Ali’i tower on 4th floor. Nicer room and closer to the beach. And non-burning shower!I was impressed with the staff in helping solve our issue and making our stay a pleasant one. If we ever get back to Honolulu, we’ll seriously consider the Hilton Hawaiian Village!","September 18, 2018"
"Super nice hotel, clean, very nice staff. Our room was really nice with a gorgeous view of the ocean and diamond head. We had a perfect view of the fireworks that are shot off every Friday evening, wonderful show! Such a treat!","September 18, 2018"
"Stayed in the Rainbow Tower Ocean/Marina view for 10 Nights on the top (31st) floor.Check in was quick as we arrived at 10:30pm but during the day the lineup looked extremely long. The main check-in area was also really crowded during the day, not a big deal, but it was a bit of a pain when you were trying to get in line for a taxi as there were piles of suitcases and bags stacked up in that area.Loved the proximity to the beach. The view was great, even though we were on the marina side you still have a lagoon and beach view.Rooms and bathrooms were basic but fine for our needs. Balcony was great to sit on and watch the sunset; you don't get sunrise from the marina side of the tower. Housekeeping were really friendly.Resort has lots of restaurants and shopping and the pools were beautiful, we had no trouble finding a chair.The Spa was a little disappointing. Staff were great but the facility is very small and the Sauna was out of service while there, so it really only left a small hot tub and a steam room. The steam room wasn't turned on when I came in, I had to try to figure out the buttons and dials on the wall to get it to work and eventually gave up. Also the day spa amenities were on a separate floor than the treatment rooms so when you were ready for you treatment you had to be escorted to elevators which are the same elevators people are using to come up to the gym etc. Just felt a little awkward and less relaxing to have to go out to the main area in your robe.Friday night fireworks were a great show but it was very crowded on the beach and when it was over it was a stampede back into the resort. Afterwards we could not get in to eat anywhere without an hour wait. I guess everyone had the same idea to go to dinner after the fireworks.The gym is located in the Kalia tower at the front of the resort. The Ali'i Tower has their own gym, but all other towers had to walk to the front of the resort and go to the Spa level to use the fitness center. It was a fairly long walk and a few days it rained so your sneakers were wet by the time you got there as most of the resort is outside.The main con for my was regarding checkput. I approached the front desk two days before we were due to checkout. We had a late flight and the weather was forecasting Hurricane Olivia to hit that day.We had planned to go to the pool or the beach for the day, but they were closing the pools and issuing warnings to stay away from the beach. Since this plan was out, we asked to pay for a late checkout. The woman told us our room ""wasn't eligible"" for a late checkout. I have stayed in many hotels and resorts and have never had them tell me we couldn't have a late checkout multiple days in advance. She said she could give me a hospitality suite for 20 minutes per person so we could shower.... Not really sure what the point of changing room for 40 minutes was.It was lucky that the Hurricane wasn't as intense as they forecasted, because we ended up finding benches at the bottom of one of the towers that were covered and stayed there most of the day. Staff at a large hotel like this should be able to accommodate a late checkout, for a fee, that was requested multiple days in advance. Most of the resort, and even their mall are outdoors, so there were not many options if you didn't have a room.Overall this resort has tons of restaurants, shopping and is in a convenient location directly on the beach. The value we got for the cost was great and I would return, but there are definitely a few areas that they could improve on.","September 18, 2018"
We just got back from a fantastic ztay at the Hilton Waikiki Village. Family trip with our 2.5 yo. Details:Floor 23Ocean viewTwo double bedsPros:Village passport was nice to save at the shopsThe beds slide so you can push them together and make a super bed if you co sleep. Towels and pool access on level 4 Kalia tower. Easy walk to the street then down the waikiki strip. Easy walk to the beach and the ABC shops are right there for your needs. Cons:If you arrive at night finding your way to Kalia is a bit confusing. The offer of on the spot room upgrades seem to have costed more than if i booked on expedia in the first place so we didn't upgrade. The walk while close is pretty chilly if you're soaking wet from the beach or super pool. Overall:Really enjoyed the stay and the view. Proximity to Goofys for breakfast from Kalia tower was nice. Very close. Would stay again. Great for family. Rooms very clean and housekeeping was quick and thoughtful. ,"September 17, 2018"
"We had a late check in (10:00 pm)on a Friday and were very tired. Upon finalizing the checking in process I was informed I had two double beds in our room. Our party consisted of two adults, two teenagers and a 5 year old. My confirmed reservation stated a junior suite with two double beds along with a pull out sofa bed. I called three times prior to leaving for Hawaii to confirm these accommodations. In all three conversations, I was assured of my requested reservations. I informed the clerk of the error and asked for the extra bed. I was told they were all booked but could accommodate us with a roll away and it would be in the room before we got there (this young man was professional and courteous). It was late so I agreed and told him I would be back in the morning to get this corrected. Upon arriving in the room, I realized the roll away was not there. I called room services and was told I would be charged extra for the roll away ( I was not charged). The next morning I spoke with a service representative and was told I can move into a new room on Sunday. I understand that most of the upper scale hotels on Waikiki are expensive but I was not expecting these rooms to be so dated; specifically the carpet, and decor. A refrigerator was available but no microwave. The trip started on a sour note, which did not leave me until the end. I will find different accommodations the next time I visit.I expected better.","September 17, 2018"
I had a pleasant experience. It is a little crowded but the kids had a blast with so many amenities nearby. The staff was friendly and kind. The lagoon and slides are very nice for the little ones to enjoy life!,"September 17, 2018"
I have always wanted to stay at this resort and was surprised at check in to find out we had a complimentary upgrade to the Ali’i Tower. Staff were all friendly and room was large and comfortable. Morning coffee on the patio at sun rise was a real treat. This tower has its own private pool which was great so you could swim and relax without getting run over by kids splashing.,"September 17, 2018"
"This Resort really is a mini village. We did not care for our initial room as we over looked a service road with lots of noise at 6am and a dumpster. When I went to the front desk and asked if they could do anything, Lorry was very helpful and quickly assigned us another room in the Tapa tower on a higher floor. We are so grateful as we had a much nicer view and slept much better. We enjoyed all of the amenities but especially the Hawaiian music.","September 17, 2018"
"This place is huge! Closely to 3000 rooms in many different towers. As this property does not provide digital key, I need to make checkin thru reception. Queues were super long, but I was served quite quickly. Quick walk to the diamond tower to my room. Room was quite nice, really out date out, but nice. Loud AC, stinky bath room (mold) . My stay here was good, nothing special but not quite Hilton quality you would expect.","September 16, 2018"
"Large complex and great location but nickel and dime you for everything. The rooms are old and need some work. The on-site restaurants are very over priced and the food isn’t that food, you have to wait forever to get a table.","September 16, 2018"
We had a fantastic 3 day at Hilton Waikiki Beach Resort. Our room was very spacious and was clean and inviting during our stay. The towels were on the high end of luxury. The staff was very accommodating to any requests that we had. Also the staff was very knowledgeable when we had to ask directions which was often. I would recommend staying there any time you are booking a trip to Honolulu. We stayed in the Diamond Head Building as they have several buildings. Our room did look out over the ocean and you could hear the fireworks that were on display on Friday evening. We had a great balcony also with chairs provided.,"September 16, 2018"
"OK, I admit we were in Waikiki July 4th week with every one else but if this is a 4/5 star hotel, I would be surprised, with taxes, fees and resort fees we paid $500 per night for a room, at that price I expect to be impressed. The room was large and clean and tidy. The interiors are tired and dated, the chair leather or leatherette was torn, there was a need for a touch up of paint. The pools while nice, were shoulder to shoulder people most of the day, as was the beach, not fun. It's Hawaii so I expected everything to be overpriced but prices where over the top for everything! when a 5-10 minute walk down the road probably got you something cheaper and /or nicer. If you want to stay with 5,000 of your friends stay here. It's a $200-300 per night hotel pretending to be something else. The fireworks were fun but frankly I think I would have liked to saved $$ on the hotel room, the kids and I have seen fireworks before. The power went out for several hours so thankfully we weren't on the 20th floor. The spa staff were nice and helpful, treatments were priced about usual for a hotel however, i found it annoying to have to check in and then go down on a lift plus the quiet space was not quite lots of traffic noise and people smoking somewhere nearby as that wafted up in the space.","September 16, 2018"
"A great location with great facilities. Swimming in the ocean at night in front of the hotel was very pleasant. We arrived at 6:00am after a ten hour flight and were able to check in for an extra $50, worth it. The room was pleasant I would have liked to be higher.","September 16, 2018"
"Book through Costco, pretty good deal come with 7 days upgraded rainbow towers high floor room, 7 days Alamo full size vehicle( was given option for mid SUV or Altima, deal also includes daily resort fees and set parking)Based on 7 days rental vehicle, daily resort fees and parking around 700 dollars package on top of rainbow tower upgrade! Good deal Costco, 2 stars for it!When we arrived, no one offer to help with our luggages just chatty front serve, after drop off 3 luggages and wife, parked my rental in the parking garage right around the corner. Not bad at all just have to park above 3rd floors in the parking structure. Went back to hotel lobby, and wife still waiting to check in(yet no one offer to help with all bags and 2 large luggages....)No one actually waiting in line with 8 counters opens still wanted more than 10 mins. Here is why, we also Hilton honors member, so we waited in honor member line, 3 counter for general checking are occupied by other quests. But 2 counters totally opened with sign on top (digital check in...) 2 guys just kept talking and failed to help out waiting quest (us).After we check in and got up to our dream room(what a beautiful view ( which all of us pay for it) but that’s about it. Very very plain regular room with a so dirty and disgusting chair next to the desk. What a shame!Here is the picture, u be the judge for a 350 dollars per night room. This is the chair Hilton offers you!! BTW, I did try it out, it makes such loud noise whenever you sit on it...Pictures from both side of lobby entrance, no one there waiting beside us and still take more than 15 mins to check in and no one offer to help our luggages! So far the view which we paid for got 1 star, we will see what’s next!","September 16, 2018"
This place is massive! But despite its size and the number of people it didn’t really feel like too many people at all. The pools are great and the beach is lovely - Warm and calm. Staff were great. Check-in was a bit overwhelming and probably the only time we felt like cattle and of course we took the offered room upgrade (at a price) - after all how could we have loved our old room when we were told the upgraded one was ‘so much better’. We were in Tapa Tower and upgraded to level 29 with a partial water view that was actually really good of the lagoon (better than what Sydney defines as partial water view which is standing on your tippy toes and straining your head at unnatural angles for a glimpse of the big blue). Rooms are big - shame they don’t have queen size beds in double rooms (we travelled with two kids) but this seems the norm in Hawaii. Location wise - it’s between the big Ala Moana Shopping Centre and the main Waikiki drag - the weather wasn’t great for us (lots of rain due to Storm Olivia) so getting around wasn’t that easy and I feel we didn’t quite work out the best way to do this. In good weather it would be a pleasant stroll. It was kind of nice being in a slightly less intense part of town though. ,"September 14, 2018"
"The resort was first class all the way with one minor exception. The ""special concierge"" for the Ali'i tower was subpar. The concierge for the other towers were much more helpful. Other than that, it was a fabulous experience. ","September 14, 2018"
"This resort is huge, if you want peace and quiet than stay somewhere else. Great beach and pools. Lots of food choices but very expensive. Can’t beat the location right on the beach. Very friendly and helpful staff.","September 14, 2018"
"We stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort. It was great to be able to easily access the pools with our grandchildren and walk directly on to the beach day and night. We loved the fireworks on the beach the Friday night we arrived. It was also amazing walking along the beach track, the ocean is truly beautiful. A great place to stay with family. ","September 14, 2018"
"While on business, a friend who was staying at a different hotel asked me where I was staying, I said, “Hilton Hawaiian Village,” and she responded, “Nice! Upscale :)” It is the best place to stay-a village within Waikiki where there’s shopping/dining/lots of activities to do. Whenever I can afford to, this is the place to be. Thank you for a wonderful stay.","September 13, 2018"
"We arrived today 13th September for the last part of our honeymoon having previously stayed in Vegas for 3 nights at the MGM and Maui for 7 nights at the kanaapali beach hotel. Compared to these hotels this is a disappointment. Our room in the tapa tower 3044 was meant to be a partial ocean view. Our balcony faced other buildings the only ""ocean"" view was from a small window which was covered in bird faeces which made it difficult to see out and also looked right on to other guests balcony so not private at all. Every hotel I have ever been to which I have paid for partial ocean view MEANT you could see ocean view from your balcony. We phoned up to get upgrade rather than change to another ""partial ocean view"" as the partial ocean views actually don't show ocean on balcony. This ""ocean view"" room we are now in room 2393 in my previous experience is in my opinion a partial ocean view. Moral of story don't expect great things at this hotel the rooms are dated and it has put a damper on the end of our honeymoon having stayed at two great hotels previously. Would not recommend this hotel for honeymoon. Pics attached of our partial ocean view and new ocean view.","September 13, 2018"
"Stayed in the Kalia tower from 4 Sept 18 -9 Sept 18 in a ocean view room. The resort is magnificent and plenty of activities for the entire family or singles.Close to all the actions around town so no need for car rental. If you want to take a day trip, you can rent a car there at the resort. Staff throughout the resort was wonderful.","September 12, 2018"
"The best locale on Waikiki beach, convenient to all property venues and especially the beach and major pool areas. We stayed a night upon arrival and departure with a week sandwiched between at the timeshare club.","September 12, 2018"
"Just spent several days with some friends at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki. We were in the Ali’i Tower, which was fine. However, the pool area at the Ali’i was under construction, yet they still allowed people to access it, having made a makeshift bar which seemed like an afterthought. The pool itself is in dire need of a re-do, which I assume is on the docket with the bar/restaurant/jacuzzi refurbishment. Better to close the entire pool area all together because any tranquility expected by using the exclusive pool is ruined by construction noise.I do have to say that ALL of the food we had at the resort was good, no matter where it was. The Tropics Bar had great drinks of all kinds, including DELICIOUS dacquiris. There’s an appetizer called “Potato Sidewinders” that are a must, and I had a crab BLT for lunch one day that killed.The most amazing food in my opinion was the breakfast buffet in the bottom of the Rainbow Tower. I had a daily complimentary continental breakfast and had the freshest of salad, fruit, and juice, some delicious potstickers, fabulous croissants, etc. The customary eggs, etc were also available. Excellent and friendly service here. We had drinks and appetizers more than one evening at the Bali Steakhouse out in the bar lounge area, and our server Joanna was fabulous. There was fun live music most nights at the Tapa Bar at the Tapa pool, and of course there is tons of shopping available at the resort.I would not say that this is a luxury experience, however. The entire place is in need of refurbishment. The stingy pool towel service is weird, and overall the hotel service, while friendly, could be more helpful - and it’s pretty expensive for the mid-range quality of the hotel itself.","September 12, 2018"
"We stayed in the Lagoon Tower, 8/30/18 - 9/4/18 9th floor, ocean view, 2 bdrm, 2 bath suite. Our suite was spacious. Actually, the living space was huge as were the bedrooms, with roomy bathrooms and a large balcony. We had 4 adults [ my husband, myself and our two sons, both in their mid-20's]. The suite says it sleeps 6 and I could easily see 6 adults fitting comfortably in the room or families with 3+ children. The entire resort is gorgeous, restaurants and shops on property are convenient and loads more are within easy walking distance. The location is close to the highways for trips out of Honolulu and is close to attractions such as Diamond Head and the Waikiki Aquarium. Valet parking is worth the difference versus self parking and the valet staff was extraordinary. Really, every person on staff we encountered was extraordinary - friendly, helpful, welcoming. Housekeeping also deserves kudos - they were wonderful. Both check-in and check-out were a breeze.Some reviews mention the scarcity of pool chairs to be had - we always found at least one to put our things on while we swam so it wasn't an issue but you have to remember there's limited land upon which to build and we think things were set up pretty perfectly. Loved the great lawn, pools, the lagoon and were able to watch the fireworks from our balcony - what a treat!It was a lively place with people of all ages and everyone seemed to appreciate that. I know we do. Definitely recommend this resort - beachfront plus the city - perfection!","September 12, 2018"
"HHV made our first trip to Hawaii even more wonderful than we expected. The staff was warm, knowledgeable, friendly and always smiling. Our room was clean and comfortable with an amazing view of the ocean which was a 1 minute walk away. The entire resort was clean and had everything we needed and more, all within short walking distance, which was great because of a disability. On our next visit to Oahu will would love to stay at the HHV Resort again!","September 12, 2018"
"We stayed at the Ali'i II Tower. The view was gorgeous and the beach was nice. We liked the extra amenities this tower offered us. You have everything you would need at the complex, but it's very expensive. It is worth an Uber, Lift, or cab to eat outside of the complex. The restaurant in our building was good and worth the price, but the other places in the complex were over priced with little value. The hotel itself is what you would expect from a Hilton.","September 11, 2018"
"Massive complex but still manages to be friendly and easy to get in and out of.We upgraded to the Rainbow Tower on arrival - an extra $105US a night, expensive but big room and big views. Balcony looked over the Lagoon Pool, marina and ocean. Spectacular sunsets. Only issue was noise from neighbouring rooms.Would happily go back.","September 11, 2018"
"Stayed here with the kids for our last 4 nights in Honolulu. Great resort. Everything you need on the property. In theory, if you came here and just wanted to relax, you wouldn’t even need to leave the resort. Nice location, and great service. Only con with this resort is how busy it is. However, nothing you can do about that. Check in would take longer, however because we were in the Ali’i tower, we had a separate check in so wasn’t bad. Valet takes a while to get your car though. All in all it was a great stay. ","September 11, 2018"
Fantastic hotel. It is absolutely gigantic and takes sometime to see it all.The lagoon is great and very family friendly. The beach is directly opposite the lagoon and a little quiter than the main beach section in Waikiki as the hilton hawaii village is a little further north.Lots of fantastic restaurants and stores within the village but be prepared to pay top dollar as should be expected from a high tourist destination.The hotel is within walking distance to all stores and restaurants in Waikiki.Friday nights has the fireworks display but come early if you want a seat.,"September 11, 2018"
"Upon arrival we were welcomed to stand in a queue to check in for at least 25 minutes. Although given the size of the resort, it was lovely to be entertained by a lady playing the ukulele.Given we had provided at least 7 months notice, we were disappointed that our 5 rooms were not close by as per our request. Not only that, they weren't in the same towers. Whilst they were able to move us to the same tower, they weren't able to keep us to the same floor.We found the double beds at Hilton were of a rather small size, although our expectation may be higher given we had just travelled from Maui where we had resided at Hyatt and were in awe as they did indeed exceed our expectations.The refrigerator at Hilton was in the bathroom. Whilst some people may appreciate having a can or carton during nature calls, it certainly wasn't to our taste. The locks in the bathrooms were not operational in 3 out of the 5 rooms and maintenance works are most definitely required in the Kalia Tower. The other towers may well be nicer but we didn't get the pleasure of staying there so can't be too sure.If you're choosing to stay for the facilities, look around at other hotels or a different tower at Hilton. Whilst the location is great, anyone (No matter which hotel you reside at) is welcomed to use the facilities.The lagoon outside of rainbow tower was fantastic for the little ones and I'm sure the views were spectacular if you opt for an ocean view room. We just weren't offered the pleasure of staying in one, (even at an increased room rate) so that we could all stay closer to each other.The Spa facilities are lovely. Although it was overcrowded when we went but I guess it was to be expected given we were pretty much on shut down due to the expected hurricane.Regardless of the above, we still managed to have ourselves a lovely holiday although if you ask if we'd stay there again, the answer would list certainly be... thank you but, no from all 14 travellers.","September 9, 2018"
"Overall this is a great place to stay ! There are many restaurants, shops and stores . You can also take your tour buses right from the property which makes it very convient. The pools and the beach were amazing ! I would go again if I could ! ","September 9, 2018"
"I've stayed at many Hilton's and generally like them, often they're a safe bet and although not always amazing they're tidy and clean.... usually! I stayed here for a week in August and this was a very different Hilton. The short version was:when we arrived we were given two awful rooms- dated (and I mean awfully) noisy, smelly and not at all what I paid for. On day two luckily we were moved to the Tapa Tower with smaller rooms but still spacious and a bit closer to what I expected. The pools were so old that they desperately need an overhaul, the lagoon smells pretty stale, was very surprised to see people swimming in it!! Restaurants were all a bit of a let down and generally hugely overpriced. Staff were not particularly helpful and very much gave the impression you were inconveniencing them. Two people on the excursions desk were lovely (I wish I could remember their names). Overall, the whole place seemed like it needs a bit of an overhaul. I say go to the Sheraton down the road or the Outrigger (it may have a small beach area but it's 1000 times better). If you do want to be this end of Waikiki visit the Ilikai hotel next door!","September 9, 2018"
"I would like to highlight the excellent service provided by the young men that worked at the beach area where the umbrellas and chairs are rented. Please see picture. I didn't get their names but they were all great. They are professional, fun and loved what they do. They cater to everyone's needs and they always had a smile. They are definitely an asset to the hotel. ","September 9, 2018"
"We stayed here in June and absolutely loved the Hilton Hawaiian resort. We stayed in the Tapa Tower on the 35th floor. Our room was lovely, spacious and the view amazing with sea view & mountain view. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. No visit to Hawaii should be without visiting Pearl Harbour, Hawaiian Cultural Centre, town Hall where Hawaii 5'O is filmed and of course a Mai Tai.","September 9, 2018"
"I have to say that I used to love this resort! What happened? My husband and I got engaged here in 2014 and it seems that since then the resort has deteriorated quite a bit. Rooms are dirty and dusty and the walls and tables are all chipped and worn out. (We stayed in the Rainbow Tower) I guess for what you pay you’d expect a bit more out of the experience. I will say that the overall service is still great and the location can’t be beat if Waikiki is where you’re wanting to spend your time. One other area I wish I could change is to add room service. There are a multitude of food options but absolutely no form of room service. It’s a mega resort so I’d imagine that could pose a logistical issue but it would be so convenient to have at least one or two options. They don’t even allow the pizza place to deliver to the rooms. I don’t think I’ll be back, as I’d rather stay somewhere else that will provide more bang for my buck. ","September 8, 2018"
"We were a family of 4 adults and two children aged 3,6 staying in two rooms in the Tapa Tower for 11 nights. Yes, the rooms are dated but they were very clean, big and adequate. We had a partial ocean view which was lovely. The shower always seemed to be cold water though. Beds were comfy. We never had to wait for lifts like other people have mentioned. The WiFi worked well. Check in was long and lines moved slowly but there is so much action that timed passed quickly while we waited. They had Michiko playing a Ukelele and it was fun ‘people watching’. We were lucky to get into our room at 1pm, thanks to Liz on reception. There was no porter service to our room. The grounds and pools were lovely. There are plenty of pool lounges and we only had to wait maximum a few minutes before some became available. They are close together but everyone wasn’t laying on them so it didn’t feel like you were right beside someone. The lifeguards are strict on pool toys in some of the pools but you could have them in the Tapa pool. The gardens and birds are lovely. We were disappointed the fireworks were cancelled due to the Hurricane but that is no fault of the resort. We didn’t eat at any venues on the resort as we ventured out to nearby restaurants. The ABC store we found still quite pricey and it was very crowded in the shops with not much space. The biggest thing for our family who travel regularly to similar resorts in the pacific was lack of inclusions for the price you pay. It seems to be the norm in Hawaii to charge a Resort Fee. We didn’t like paying it (but knew we had to) as we felt it was a lot more for receiving very little in return. We are use to having breakfast included in resorts, a porter, beach lounges and umbrellas provided for beach use, shuttle buses to a shopping area and parking. The HHV has all these but for extra charges which really put us off. We attended one lei making class which is suppose to be one of the things covered in the resort fee. We are glad we have been to Hawaii and we did all the tourist activities so we feel we don’t need to rush back which is disappointing as we thought we would return annually. Not sure if we would return to HHV. We went in and checked out the Illikai resort next door in a room on the 23rd floor, which are all nicely renovated rooms, had a full kitchen and the resort fee is only $25 per day. That seems to suit our family needs more.......","September 8, 2018"
"This was my 5th time back to the HHV. I wouldn’t keep coming back if it were bad. I read others reviews and I just shake my head... “too crowded”. It’s a “village” hence the name. It’s crowded because you don’t even have to leave the resort !! There are numerous restaurants, Starbucks, shops, pools, bars, all on site !! Sheesh, did you expect to be there alone? “Everything is overpriced”. Really? It’s Hawaii. In case you didn’t realize even local McDonald’s are more expensive. Gas is about $1 more per gallon. Good lord folks. “Parking is expensive”. I’ll give ya that one. It is really my only complaint about the HHV is I believe they just overcharge the guests for parking. This time I was in the Rainbow Tower with both front facing AND Diamond Head facing views and balconies. I assure you spend a little more for rainbow diamond head views. You’ll be hard pressed to find a more beautiful view anywhere. We were in room 1401. 3 adults. We had a king bed ( very comfortable and nice feathered pillows) and they brought in a roll away bed with a very nice thick mattress on it that was great. Bathroom is kinda small but definitely enough room. Small little dressing area and ample closet. Mini fridge as well. We thoroughly loved it. ","September 7, 2018"
"We booked six months in advance and paid a lot of money to have a partial ocean view room. We thought we were getting a 4-5 star hotel. This place is stuck in the 80s the furniture in the rooms is old dark some chipped and needs a paint job. Too crowded and everything in the Village us over priced! The resort fee is a killer and I’m not sure what it covered at all. We assumed umbrellas and seats by lagoon and beach would be covered by resort fee nope extra! Sorry that just isn’t right. Checkin needs to be looked at 45 mins to check in with one person serving the main queue also unacceptable. People were nice, but really compared to 4/5 star in Asia this place is left for dead!! Harsh I know but true.","September 7, 2018"
we stayed here for 9 nights and despite a hurricane coming we had a great time. We were upgraded to a one bed suite on 33rd floor overlooking Waikiki and their famous Lagoon. Beautiful and clean. Staff very friendly and attentive. Lovely place if a little busy - ABC stores everywhere to cater for your breakfast and lunch needs should you not wish to visit a restaurant 3 times each day. Probably one of the pricier resorts but everything is close by.,"September 7, 2018"
"Great location, walking distance to Alo Moana and Waikiki beach area. Very good restaurants in the resort, especially recommend the Blue Water Shrimp, excellent value and quality seafood, CJ's great breakfast, will stay here again.","September 7, 2018"
"After a almost 3 hour wait to check in people everywhere not enough stuff to manage the linesBecause my family was 6 adults 4 children and an infant the solo worker pre checking in the lines could not manage a large group on her ipad so we waited watching smaller groups over take us, mistake number 1 we had children who were hot bothered and thirsty.No one helped us to our rooms with all our luggage as well as they separated my young adult children and there partners to the Rainbow tower and the rest of us in the Tapa tower, mistake number 2.The Tapa room was old and had that old mustard smell the balcony outside is nothing to brag about it could do with some new paint and carpet update.Phone kept having issues ringing out all the time just to make reservations for toursIt was very annoying calling guest services only for them to think they know more than u when u explain clearly it doesn't work!But overall all staff here are very nice. For what we paid i am disappointed with this hotel and wouldn't recommend this for large families on a budget everything onsite is expensive. Don't be fooled by the price you see there's tax on top at checkout and tropics restaurant will charge you $34 because they consider a family of 2 adults and 3 kids as a large family.Although we loved our stay in Hawaii and definitely come back in the near future It won't be here","September 6, 2018"
"We stayed at the HHV from 20 - 31 August, 2018. It is a very large complex with five towers consisting of 3300 rooms (so I am told). August is one of their busiest months. Check in: Yes there is a wait at certain times of the day, but once it was our turn staff were efficient, very pleasant and helpful.Accomodation: We stayed in the Tapa Tower, room was a good size and clean. No jug to boil water for a cup of tea, but we bought a cheap one and used that. Rooms were cleaned daily by very friendly, considerate and efficient staff. Five stars to them.Pools: Very crowded. Crowds did dissipate by holidays end. Due to the tall towers some pools do not get a lot of sun.Beach: Beach is inferior to our beaches in Australia (Sunshine Coast, Qld) but still very nice. Sand is coarser and lots of rocks, pebbles and broken coral under foot. Some sections are better than others. Solved the problem with reef shoes.Food: We personally found the food expensive. We did not eat anywhere on site at the HHV we sourced our meals at other venues.Tours Desk: Very helpful and obliging.Resort Fee: Did not like paying it but seems to be universal at all hotels just varies in price.We found the HHV to be in a good position. We walked to Ala Moana Shopping Centre every other day and also to the Zoo in the opposite direction.","September 6, 2018"
"A great summer vacation with the family. Resort is full of amenities. Pools, bars, restaurants, beaches and even a lagoon. Paddle boarding, snorkeling, swimming, submarine rides, luau on the roof. Spectacular ocean views from our lanai. Spa was a little over loaded. The towers are a little dated. Over all it was a great place to stay.","September 6, 2018"
"It's all worth it. The room is clean. Staffs are friendly & helpful. We woke up to the sound of the waves splashing on the beach. The water was clear blue. The pools were clean. The heated pool was nice. The village is perfect. It is just expensive. ABC is awesome. I wish the hotel put up water stations, more outside shower stations, recycle stations, coffee stations. We really had a goo time.","September 6, 2018"
"The moment we arrived at the Kalia towers, we were met by the bellman who immediately took care of us because the check in counter was closed, but shuttled is over to the main lobby and back. Our suite was amazing, clean and big with 2 balcony with a spectacular view of the whole resort and ocean. The amenities, everything just made us feel like royalty, enjoy the pools, shops, different events held on the property or entertainment, fireworks on Friday nights, just beautiful.","September 6, 2018"
"Our check in was quick and staff was friendly. Our view double balcony view was amazing as well as our room. Although our trip was short BUT MEMORABLE, we will be returning to enjoy the remainder of the resorts amenities.","September 5, 2018"
"Not all people are resort people. Some of us have moon tans and aren't even remotely athletic. Even non-resort types will find Hilton Waikoloa Beach Resort has something to offer. In the heat of the day I rode the train back and forth hatching Pokemon eggs and spinning Poke stops, and we took a pleasant ride on the boat in the afternoon breeze.There are lovely shops nearby for reasonably priced cafe lunches, and in the evening we had a glorious sunset picnic, followed by a swim under the stars. There's plenty of wildlife to see, resident and squatters, and art to look at in the walkway. If you're sporty you can do standup paddle boarding in the lagoon, but we chiefly enjoyed it for the fish leaping about in it as the tide came in. Even if you aren't a resort type, there's plenty to enjoy at the Hilton Waikoloa Beach Resort","September 5, 2018"
"This was our fourth stay at the HHV resort but the first in a Jr. Suite. We took advantage of a super rate for celebrating the Rainbow Tower's 50th anniversary. Gorgeous view. Spotlessly clean room. We waited in the Hilton Honor's line maybe 5 minutes. With it being Labor Day weekend, there were many people waiting to check in. Our check in was flawless. I love the fact that it is close to everything. The Ala Moana Mall is about a 15-minute walk away. There are many fun shops right on the resort grounds also including Honolulu Cookie Company and an ABC store. The grounds as always were beautiful and inviting. We ate at Round Table Pizza. You will find that all of the restaurants including Round Table are a bit pricey. The one thing that I am not fond of is the resort tax. The ""perks"" at least for us are not worth $40 per day. I wish that there was an option to opt out of the ""perks"". Other than that, another wonderful stay at this beautiful resort.","September 4, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village is like being at a resort with a world of it's own. They have multiple pools, one with a slide for the kids, others closer to the different hotel towers. There's a lagoon where anyone can swim or rent a kayak, paddle board, paddle tri-cycle with no wave interference. Just a 100 yards away is the beach with clear saltwater. You have to go at lease 30 yards past the Rainbow tower towards Diamond head so you'll have sandy shores instead of the rocky shores. They have multiple restaurants, ice cream shop, ABC stores, bars, a luau, live entertainment and Friday evening fireworks at 8pm. It's walking distance to other restaurants, Ala Moana shopping center, Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, International Market Place and the Waikiki Beach coastline. Parking is a bit pricey. Daily registered guest self parking is $43 and daily registered valet parking is $50. It's a great family, couples, friends or even by yourself get away. One problem was the tower we stayed at had 3 elevators and the line to get into the elevators was long. I guess everyone was going back to their rooms at the same time. But this is a Great Place to Stay and relax.....","September 4, 2018"
"First and foremost, the grounds are gorgeous, the stores and restaurants are convient, and the location on the beach is perfect. Unfortunately, the hotel operation is amateur at best and the rooms are a bit beat up. A few key examples that injure the experience:Check-In- 40 minute wait in the Hilton Honors line. Watched the general line turn over three times while we waited. They finally started to realize that two agents for the whole Honors line wasn’t cutting it after 40 min. Also, they handed out water to the regular line. Nothing for the HHonora line. Want to know why it was taking so long? They attempt to upsell every customer to a more expensive room. That said, we did end up getting a room upgrade (better view) for our 40 minute wait. I’d rather have not stood there for so long. Towels- Ridiculous system. You get issued two towel cards. You trade them poolside or beachfront for towels. The places nearest the beach close at 5pm so you either have to cross the entire resort to find one place that stays open late to return the towel and get your card back or keep your wet towel overnight. Not a great customer experience.Beach- As other reviews said, high prices to get a towel or umbrella on the beach. Seems a bit crazy given the high amenity fee. I’m at a resort on Maui now and for the same amenity fee chairs and umbrella use is included. Overall, the resort is crowded. Don’t expect a relaxing experience. It was like being in a theme park. Crowded pools, always a wait for the elevator, lengthy lines in the lobby each day. I won’t be back. There are better options for the money.","September 4, 2018"
Good location and hospitality service for Hilton hornor members I will recommend family and friend to stay hereWe will choose this resort again when we return to WaikikiVery good for families with kids,"September 4, 2018"
"Birthday vacation trip to Hawaii.  My trip for my birthday vacation started a year ago when I decided that I wanted to be somewhere beautiful. I was not disappointed, my entire experience at the Hilton Hawaiian Village resort complex was beyond my expectations. The staff were exceptionally helpful courteous went out of their way to make sure I had a truly enjoyable time. My room was spacious and clean. I would recommend this vacation place to anyone who wants to go and enjoy beautiful scenery and relaxing atmosphere.","September 4, 2018"
"Stayed in Tapa Tower 1 bedroom suite which have amazing views of the ocean and resort. There are balconies directly facing the beach and a side balcony off the bedroom looking up towards the marina. Our family of four (two teens) had adequate space. One full bath and another half bath, however with sinks outside the bathrooms it allowed us to efficiently get ready each day. The property could use some updating as it is showing its age. This property places you on the best section of Waikiki Beach and is great for swimming due to the breakwater and the large size of the swimming area. The fireworks Friday night were great as well. Lots of off resort shopping and restaurants within easy walking distance.Biggest complaint, and many guests expressed this, is only two of the four elevators for floors 19-35 worked well during our stay August 15-21. Most guests took it in stride and joked about it (hey we were in Hawaii on vacation after all). However for the price guests are paying to stay on resort it is a very annoying issue. My son and I resorted a few times to taking a floor 1-18 elevator to 18 and taking the steps to the 32nd floor. Additionally there is a lot of room for check in improvements. I used online check in and arrived at 9:45pm with this service unavailable. noted large line ups several times during our stay.","September 3, 2018"
Hotel is in a perfect area right off the beach with several pools on property the only drawbacks are that the rooms are a little outdated and some of the wall hooks for towels fell off and ar certain times the pools got very crowded,"September 3, 2018"
"I don't know where to start..It has everything you need! Pools, amazing restaurants with variety (a bit expensive but, it's Hawaii), a lot of stores from souvenir shops to Gucci, surf lessons available and many more activities($)! I was staying in the Rainbow Tower and the view from our room was absolutely stunning. The room was one of the cleanest hotel room I have ever seen. It was my first time in Waikiki and I will definitely book with this hotel again when I go back. Also, it's only about 25 minutes from the airport!","September 2, 2018"
"Arrived at 3:00 PM on Saturday, Sept 1st, 2018.This is the line waiting to check-in. The lines moved about three meters after 20 mins waiting. The staff may have just learned how to use the computers.","September 1, 2018"
Best views due to both the lagoon and the ocean! We ended up with a time-share since we loved it so much. The Hawaiian village is exceptional since you have the convenience of all the small shops so you don't need to eat out every meal. Practical and beautiful banyan tree and courtyard in Rainbow Bazaar. Luau show was great too!,"September 1, 2018"
"Stayed in ""tapa"" . Considering this is the famous hilton hotel... it was crap.!!4 of us paid a huge amount of money to stay 10 nights. Plus tax... no breakfast included. We had to buy a toaster and bread etc. No tea and horrible,week coffee from a machine. No milk supplied only coffee mate which isn't good in tea. Maintenance issues not resolved. Dirty water from room above leaked in through the light/ vent above our shower; so electrocution was a concern. Room air con vents not clean. Room not vacuumed.Very busy resort. Thousands of people. ","September 1, 2018"
Overall the room in the rainbow tower is very nice with a gorgeous view. That is where pretty much any of the redeeming qualities of the hotel ends.The hotel is incredibly crowded with minimal shade options when trying to relax at the pool. Everything is overrun with just too many people to truly enjoy the paradise you are in. On top of that they closed the super pool for a hula which they proceeded to rope off for a private event that took up the entire pool area and the chairs they set up where not even half full. So we thought why not fill in the rest because we paid alot of money to not be able to enjoy all of the hotel amenities. We were sitting down for about thirty minutes and there was still about 25% of the chairs open when we were asked if we had a ticket. Very frustrating when the hotel restricts your options without trying to make up for this fact in another area.In the end dont bother with this over priced and overrun hotel when there are plenty of other options in the beautiful land of hawaii.,"September 1, 2018"
"We stayed in the Tapa tower on 28 th floor, with a partial ocean view.Rooms a little dated but very clean and comfortable and serviced daily.No room service, which we missed. Lots of dining options though fromSandwiches to Japanese. Pools great, hard to get a lounge around the pool.We spent most of our time by the lagoon. Swimming in the ocean was very rocky on the bottom. Expensive to hire umbrella or lounge on the beach.Overall the whole complex is well done and we totally enjoyed being here.We were there when Hurricane Lane was due and the hotel was very well preparedAnd we felt well informed and very safe and in good hands.","September 1, 2018"
"On our recent visit to Hawaii, my wife and I stayed at the Very beautiful Hilton Hawaiian Hotel in Wiki, after checking in, we were amazed at the size and beauty of this prestigious Resort. As we explored the property, my wife said to me “this place reminds me of Disneyland with the size and exotic surroundings”.We will definitely return to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and we recommend it to anyone who loves comfort and beauty.","August 31, 2018"
"Wasn't sure what to expect from Hawaii but this resort is probably a decent choice. It is right at the end of the beach away from the majority of hotels but we liked that. There are lots of pools but not a massive amount of sunbeds so you need to be up early especially if you want a sunbed which has a bit of shelter.A few places to eat which were all quite nice and vary in price from quite expensive to really expensive. You can find value for money.Don't rent any paddleboards etc from the hotel as it would be cheaper to buy them. You can get much better deals 100 yards up the beach and even cheaper the further up the beach you go.We rented a paddleboard for the day 100 yards up the beach and spent all day with the turtles - it was absolutely brilliant, we were literally in touching distance of them as they came up for air.Probably not the best hotel to stay at if you plan on going surfing every day as the majority of surfing happened further up the beach (10 mins).The beach is lit up at night and is really nice to walk around. You are about a 10 minute walk to the main centre with all the shops and restaurants. We stayed in the Tapa wing (28th Floor) which was the biggest part of the hotel. Room was fine, lifts were a disaster and everyone on the high floors were complaining about them.As part of the incredulous $43 daily resort fee you could get free movies from a DVD dispenser which you could then watch in your room. This is literally the only thing I have had included in a US hotel resort fee that we have ever used other than Wifi.","August 31, 2018"
The Village has everything that you would want and enjoy in a Hawaiian Vacation. But don't do it! Enjoy your time there and what they can furnish you and that is a lot. Just make sure you see the island and what it can offer you too. I love swimming in the lagoon and then going into the pool. Got a bad sunburn there once. My bad!The service is fantastic and the food is even better. The entertainment is first rate!! They even have a Laou for all to enjoy.I will go there again and enjoy everything that they have to offer!,"August 30, 2018"
"Amazing! Didn’t have no hiccups. Before I came I was reading a lot of the reviews and I was a bit scared but was total opposite from the horrible reviews. Check in was smooth it can’t hectic later in the day, hotel staff tries there best to get you what you desire. (In my case I got the upgrade for a small amount). Near a lot of shops and dining places. Also please keep in mind I went during Labor Day and it wasn’t bad. ","August 30, 2018"
Beautiful awesome place with great restaurants and shops all around. Waikiki beach is literally feet away. House keeping is on top of their game and everyone was pleasantly and genuinely happy to assist you,"August 30, 2018"
"We heard good review about this place so we decide to stay here with our 6 year old boy. The check-in counter is semi-outdoor and even we arrive in the morning, it’s pack with guests waiting to be check-in. Line can be long and we did waited for about 20-30 mins. Great thing about this facility is there’s several pool area for kids and adult. My son loves the pool with slides, but you gotta go early to find a chair, other wise you will be standing around. Close access to the Waikiki beach is another bonus but do get very crowded with hotel guests and tourist. Convenient location to go to restaurants and sightseeing places. ","August 30, 2018"
"From the moment we arrived we had a poor experience. Coming off a flight in the morning we found 10 people (4 groups) ahead of us in the line. I have no idea how but it took us 2 hours to get to the front of the queue? The hotel knows who is coming and when, yet somehow every single person/group spent 30 minutes at the counter. Extremely inefficient and a complete lack of respect for guests in general. How do you explain that?From there forward the service remained the same (eg did not exist). The price of food was ridiculous and pointless. For buffet we paid $50USD per person (after taxes etc were included) for a poor variety and not even an omelette station. The first morning when I turned up to a restaurant for food (after waiting in line for 2 hours + as per above) we got no table service. Was at one of the best restaurants in the venue. As for the rooms, my brother had to leave his due to a water leak down the wall. We got told we would be in one of two towers (near our Mum in the Ali’i who was celebrating her birthday which was a terrible experience but that’s another story), but we got put in a completely different tower (after waiting 6 hours after checking in). Everyone could not wait to get out of the Hilton to explore the lovely Hawaii and treated the venue as just a place to sleep, as that’s all it deserved. We spent our time out and about rather than being at the Hilton. If we had not pre paid all our nights upfront we would have left on day 2, so the Hilton walk away with our money and we walk away being told “there are so many guests here” as their excuse for anything raised and shortfalls in their service. Others are a lot more upset at the stay than I was, but it still deserves a 1. If TA had a greater scale would have given it -5. Pity as people are being mislead into this being 4 Star stay. ","August 29, 2018"
"14 of the 34 people who came to my birthday from Australia, NZ and the UK stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Waikiki Village for a week long stay, based on my recommendation. It was terrible from the start-no reply to emails trying to organise dinners for 34 people despite following up, a two hour check in on arrival despite being a Hilton honours member and staying in Ali’i tower, being told we didn’t get honour points, problems with the state of the rooms (the rooms are not cheap), a disgusting and hugely over priced buffet which any budget hotel breakfast would have bettered, inability of family to order champagne to have in my room on arrival as it was too much trouble apparently, telling them it was my birthday and not even a happy birthday comment was made. The biggest gap was the lack of smiles or any form of friendliness from the staff. There are a litany of things I could comment on. Thankfully their inability to respond favourably to enquiries for my birthday celebrations resulted in us going to the Halekulani hotel and they were awesome, they engaged, nothing was too much trouble, they treated us as valuable customers and made my special night one of amazing memories - how lucky was I that the Hilton treats everyone as a number, they didn’t care and instead I ended up with a night of magic - thank you Halekulani! We also had a fabulous breakfast and wonderful pre dinner drinks at the Moana Surfrider who also made us feel very welcome. The Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki has forgotten they are in the service industry and we as customers have a choice where we stay and I hope this review helps you all make the right choice. This experience has severely damaged the Hilton’s reputation in the eyes of the 34 guests who attended my birthday and particularly for all of us who stayed there.","August 29, 2018"
"Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort Honolulu Overall great resort 610333101 Overall this is a great resort, central to the main shopping district & any tours you wish to do. We stayed in the Tapa Tower which we viewed as very average, it's old & needs some work put into it, there was just my wife & myself & we ended up in a room with two double beds, considering we booked the trip 6 months in advance I would have though we could have got a queen bed for my 6 foot 4 inch height, good thing it was warm so my feet hanging of the end of the bed wasn't an issue, I thought most resort rooms would be King or queen beds as a minimum. A standard kettle would have been a luxury & I don't know if it was just me or every room but I'm not used to having my private bits dangle below the water surface of the toilet, now I understand why Asians tend to stand on the toilet rim, we were there when Hurricane Lane was making it's self known & everything closed down quite a hassle considering it ended up being down graded to a tropical storm with a bit of wind, should have called it Hurricane LAME. Conclusion would we stay there again, probably, but I'd confirm the tower & room details were exactly what I wanted. I guess you really do get what you pay for.","August 29, 2018"
We had high hopes since this hotel was recommended from a friend. We had just flown nine Hours to Honolulu so we were exhausted and excited at the same time. We booked this hotel for four days. Upon arriving we went to online check in desk to get keys - we waited in line just to be told we were at the wrong place. We wheeled our heavy luggage over to the ALI tower where we were asked why were we checking in there that the other area should have checked us in. All the while I had checked us in the night before. Ugh! This was the first thing that left me a little upset. We finally got up to our room in the Ali tower suite - best room you can get. Boy was I let down when I walked in. The view was nice but the smell- it was hot as all get out no lights - very dark -carpet is brown and worn and we immediately started hearing the elevator going up and down. We called the front desk to see about why the AC wasn’t working. Took them a bit and we were asleep by the time they came. The shower filled up with water while showering- the sink filled up with water when brushing my teeth. The toilet bidet seat hung off to the side since it doesn’t fit the toilet. We went to bed early and didn’t sleep all night. It was very hot and the ac blew hot air. We heard the elevator go up and down all night. Kids and people running up and down the hall all night. It was awful! Did we really pay this much money for this place? The next morning we went to eat breakfast since it was included and it was decent. There are kids everywhere ! The pool was so crowded we could barely walk around it. There are so many hotels in Honolulu and I would not recommend this one at all. There are far nicer ones and I am so glad our travel agent got us out of this one for our remaining days. We packed our bags and went down the street to a gorgeous property that was much nicer. If you are looking for a luxurious room and vacation do not pick this hotel. I don’t like to leave negative reviews but traveling this distance and for the amount of money it cost I wouldn’t want someone else to experience what we did.,"August 29, 2018"
"This was our second visit to the Hilton Hawaiian Village so we had high expectations. Other than the great view of the lagoon, beach and marina, nothing was spectacular. We were handed a welcome packet at check in along with a map. Don’t lose the map! This place is huge with 6 towers of rooms, shops and resaurants. Our room was in an older property with well worn carpets, scratched furniture and an old HVAC system. We would go to the lobby to ask questions or ask the concierge to make reservations for us and were met with either long lines or no one around. This place is not worth the price! There are a lot of other options.","August 29, 2018"
"A couple of friends and I moved went to the Hilton Hawaiian village overnight before heading back to the North shore. The suite was decent, a bit dated but it really didn’t matter since we spent most of the time at Tropics Bar. Awesome spot. The staff were very friendly at check in/out especially considering it can resemble a tropical train station at times. This place is HUGE!","August 29, 2018"
"Overall this was a Great place to stay when visiting Hawaii.. it offers so much from the pools, restaurants , shops and bars. There were a lot of children visiting as well but because there are so many options it didn't matter. we stayed in the Tapa Tower and it was beautiful, very spacious and a great view. we took a cab to a few spots never over 11 or 12 bucks. our luau (Germaine's Luau) was great very entertaining a the food was good and the sunset was beautiful . we also saw the Polynesian Magic show a true must see. The forecast was for Hurricane Lane to hit the Island Thank GOD it never did. The hotel took precautions to keep its guest informed and prepared just incase but nothing to cause panic. overall it was a great trip I would do it again and stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village","August 28, 2018"
"First time in Hawaii. Hilton is conveniently located 15-20min from the Airport. Taxi trip is approx $35USDHotel offers ample of facilities and is popular with families and kids. Having said that I feel a little ripped off - the pools and lagoon, while all very lovely, are all accessible to the public (not exclusive to resort guests) so why are we charged resort fee for every day of the stay?!?Some events had to be canceled due to threat of the hurricane. Shops, pools and even beach was closed for two days, but we were still being charged resort fee. Equipment rentals and activities are bit pricey. On a positive, we stayed at the Ali’i. Room was nice and clean. ","August 28, 2018"
"Definitely a self contained paradise. Access to lots of beach and water activities, Spa, restaurants and more. Host to many off property activities like sunset cruises, submarine rides, etc. several hotels on and off property. The staff is friendly and very hospitable. For the workout enthusiasts, a well equipped gym and jacuzzis. Well worth your time and money.","August 28, 2018"
"My husband and I knew we were staying in Oahu for 5 nights, but had not decided where. Coincidentally, we received a call from Hilton Honors selling us a 5 night stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for $600, a luau for 2, and a $200 rebate on a future stay at a Hilton if we attend a time share sales pitch. We agreed and bought the package. This was our fourth visit to Waikiki, but our first stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village. Check-in was ridiculous. The lines were long and there seemed to be a lot of customer service folks just standing around behind the counter. We were not offered bell service or told where it was. We were just given a map of the resort. One of my suitcases had lost a wheel in transit and it was a challenge to get to our room. Our package indicated we had an ""ocean-view"" room. We were put on the 9th floor in the Diamond Head Tower. This building is so old and tired. Nothing impressive about it. We were thinking that since they are trying to get us to spend $50,000 on a time share, that they would give us a stellar room. Nope. The room was tired. Paint chipping, broken furniture. Ok, so maybe the view will make up for it. Nope. If by ""ocean view"", they meant we could kinda see the ocean, then yeah, it was ocean-view. The bed was sagging and uncomfortable and the pillows were about useless. Wake up our first full day and want to check out the pools because we have heard they are great pools. First we have to turn in towel cards to get towels. You get one towel per card. The towels are the size of a hand towel and are as rough as sandpaper. We ended up buying beach towels at the ABC Store. No spots to sit at any of the pools and they were full of screaming children. We decide to pay to have an umbrella and two lounge chairs on the beach. The third party that handled the rentals could not have cared less about their job. Smoking is illegal on Hawaii beaches and when people next to us were smoking, they refused to do anything about it, claiming only HPD can enforce it. No, you can cancel your rental agreement with the offenders if the smoking doesn't cease. All of the lacklusterness we experienced did not help in persuading us to spend $50,000 on a time share. Our experience with the Hilton Grand Vacations sales people was ok, although, as other people have probably mentioned, they blatantly lie to you. Since we had actually been to the Luau during a previous visit, we were giving $150 worth of hotel dollars which we applied to our final bill. The only positive that I can think of is the elevator in the Diamond Head Tower. We never had to wait more than a few seconds any time. If you are a family with kids with no expectations of ""resort"" services, and get a rate less than $250 a night you would probably be fine at HHV, otherwise I would stay away.","August 28, 2018"
Great location for this luxury Hilton. Located in the heart of Waikiki. Close to other restaurants and activities. Great views from the ocean side rooms. Close to Pearl Harbor attractions. Taxis available and Uber drivers. ,"August 28, 2018"
"The stay we had here was terrible for the price you are paying. It is not a five star hotel at all, you will pay through the roof for everything on site, the rooms are shockingly out dated and the location leaves much to be desired (i.e. you are well out of the way of everything and it is a pain having to get to anything). If I were you, for the same price go to Moana Surf Rider or any other hotel around it. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is an absolute waste of time to stay at.","August 28, 2018"
"This is a must for anybody’s bucket list, went for my 60th birthday,beaches beautiful,food excellent, if you’re a shopaholic this is a must place,if you just want to chill out this is an ideal place,something to do everyday,site seeing is amazing. local people are very friendly and always smiling and happy.","August 28, 2018"
"First checked into Diamond Head tower in a junior suite. Very spacious and the bed very comfortable. Then went to Rainbow Tower for two nights. Amazing view and huge room. Staff were very friendly and so much to do at the hotel. Lots of restaurants to choose from except very inflated prices. We paid $10 for a hotdog with no trimmings. Not good. Hotel is very busy if that’s what your prefer. Pools are also busy and not many chairs to go around. Resort fee of $40 is a bit much considering we didn’t use any of what was included in the fee. With Hurricane Lane nearby, most restaurants in Waikiki were closed, which meant that all guests were trying to eat at the restaurants on the property. The wait for dinner was up to 2 hours long. Overall the hotel is good but way to busy for me. ","August 27, 2018"
"Like lots in Hawaii the resort is a little dated in parts but well kept and great for families. Large grounds and breach front access with a good range of restaurants to choose from, some upscale and some mid range. We had a suite in the diamond head tower for $1150 AUD a night and wasn’t all that impressed with it for the price. We’ve stayed in much better suites/villas for the same if not less. Was probably the only downside to the resort if I had to pick a negative. Outside this we had a great time and beach and man made lagoon is perfect for little ones. Recommend staying in off season when more reasonably priced.","August 27, 2018"
"We got placed in one of the oldest hotel towers in what I assume is one of the worst rooms right near a service entry and ice machine, it was noisy and a very old room but the resort in general is very good, lots to do and many great pools. Would only stay again if I ensured that the hotel tower we were in was one of the newest ones.","August 27, 2018"
Lovely resort this place is a town it self. You do not have to leave the resort for anything unless you want to do some local shopping. Location is close to amazing High End Shops. The staff at the resort go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed. I can't wait to go back and enjoy the waves in Waikiki Beach! Aloha! The picture I added is the view from the balcony in the room.,"August 27, 2018"
"We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary, had made reservations months ahead. I specifically requested a king bed. We arrived in late afternoon after a 10 hour flight expecting to be welcomed and assigned our room promptly. What a disappointment! It was a madhouse to say the least. I waited in one of several lines for 2 and 1/2 hours just to get checked it. The clerk kept going back into the office, finally gave us our keys and some vague directions to our rooms. I was not told that no King rooms were availabl, found 2 double beds upon arriving in my room. My ocean view room had 2 bldgs in front of us but we did have somewhat of an ocean view. They did however, move us to a very nice, king bed room the next day with a lovely view. The staff was always pleasant and food at the restaurants was good although very pricey. If you are going to have a nice quiet vacation, sit by a pool or the beach, this is not your place. If you want guaranteed sleeping arrangements (ie. King, queen or doubles), this is not your place.","August 27, 2018"
Better save or bring a lot of credit cards. Everything here is expensive. We did see a lot and took tours. Pearl Harbor was worth the whole cost of the trip. Food was soso. Drinks were soso... Had wanted to go there for a long time. Won't go back.,"August 27, 2018"
"Our first family holiday to Hawaii and we chose the Ali’i Tower and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel was very busy and is enormous, with thousands of people, but it was surprising just how well it functioned, with lots of pools and restaurants and plenty of activities to keep the kids busy. You do need to get a pool location early or take your chances and everything is extra, particularly if you want to sit on the beach with an umbrella, sun lounge, etc. be prepared to pay. Our room in Ali’i was comfortable and while the tower has its own private pool, we didn’t tend to use it. I was annoyed that late in the day, the perfect time for a drink over looking the beach, around 5pm, the bar shut! But overall an enjoyable stay.","August 27, 2018"
"We upgraded to Alii Tower, well worth the extra money for the private pool and front of the line dinner reservations. Great selection of restaurants located in this resort. The lagoon has kayaks, paddle boats and boards. It's in a great location, close to mall. ","August 27, 2018"
Decided to bypass the Christmas tree and gifts for family time instead. Great time had by all. The restaurants within the resort were excellent food made by locals. Loved the resort and the staff. Would recommend for all families to visit.,"August 27, 2018"
"This was my 3rd time visiting this resort and the first time with my children. They had us staying initially in the Tappas building well that building hasn’t been renovated since it’s opening over 30 years ago. I went to the front desk after my first night and after speaking with 2 front desk staff the second one Winnie worked it out for me she got me into the Ali’i tower and I was very pleased. For the money you pay to stay there, they have to invest in renovating those old towers. The beach wasn’t the best but it was tolerable. The grounds were nice and they had a few good spots to eat for dinner and breakfast.","August 27, 2018"
"We were first time travellers to Hawaii and the Hilton Hawaiian Village was described to me as ""great for families"". Given I was travelling with my family and based on this advice, I booked our 7 night stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. We flew overnight and arrived at the check-in desk at 9:00am having had no sleep in 24 hours. The queue to check-in was chaotic and the only way to have access to a room before 3:30pm was to pay $75USD to check in early. We agreed and were given a room in the Tapa Tower. The hotel room was clean, well appointed with two double beds and a lovely view. It was serviced daily and toiletries provided.The Hilton Hawaiian Village is truly a ""village"" - everything you could need during your stay can be bought/found within the village. There are many restaurants as well but we found that everything within the Hilton Hawaiian Village is expensive compared to buying these same items in town.There is also a daily resort fee of $37USD. I still don't know what you get for this price because you pay extra for everything anyway and the customer service is non-existent. Beach umbrella's and chairs also come at an exorbitant extra cost. To hire two chairs and an umbrella on the beach for the day will set you back $65USD. Further down Waikiki beach the price to hire these same items is approximately $35USD.There are several pools within the resort and if you are travelling with children this is a bonus, particularly if they're not strong swimmers nor confident in the ocean.The shear scale of this resort also means that it is crowded. So if you're looking for a more intimate, quiet stay the Hilton Hawaiian Village is not for you. I was completely shocked when I saw just how many people there were staying in this resort - it's like being at a big theme park in terms of crowds. All that aside, the biggest disappointment with this resort was that we were conned into attending a sales presentation on purchasing ""timeshare"" with Hilton Grand Vacations. We attended the tour desk to book some tours during our time in Honolulu. While booking these tours, we were offered a discount in return for our attendance to a “presentation on becoming a Hilton member and tour of the resort”. Please don't be fooled like we were - the presentation is not about ""membership"" and there is no tour of the resort. The presentation it is about ""ownership"" and there is a great difference between ""becoming a Hilton member"" and ""becoming a Hilton owner""!! The sales staff at the Hilton Grand Vacations DID give us the HARD SELL. They made us feel inadequate for staying in a hotel room when we could be staying in a more premium style accommodation for a very princely sum. These people were rude and condescending. We would've been genuinely interested in knowing about the benefits of becoming Hilton Members, which we now know is called Hilton Honours and we believed we were attending a presentation about this. The Tour desk should have explained this ""presentation"" was about purchasing real estate/timeshare within the Hilton Hawaiian Village – it is deceptive to tell guests that the presentation is about “membership”. We certainly weren't interested in purchasing real estate while on a family holiday.In summary, the Hilton Hawaiian Village is a lovely resort but crowded and expensive. We checked out some other hotels while we were in Waikiki and I think there are much better, nicer, more luxurious and quieter accommodation options.","August 26, 2018"
"Besides issues with ants in the shower and a clogged drain, the hotel was beautiful and had great amenities. The hotel check in process can be a little chaotic, especially if you stay it the main towers. Recommend staying in the HGVC towers.","August 26, 2018"
"I arrived in Hawaii just as Hurricane Lane was heading towards the islands. Fortunately the storm never hit but the hotel management and staff ensured we were fully informed and the resort was made as safe as possible. That drama aside I had a wonderful 3 days and 2 nights enjoying the extensive resort and beautiful gardens. My room was on the 23rd floor of the Rainbow Tower with a view of the ocean and lagoon pool. The room itself was very large with 2 double beds, desk and chair, plenty of cupboard space and balcony. Foods were limited initially due to so many places closed during the hurricane watch but I was then able to eat at a different place with each meal. My tower had the Bali Steak & Seafood restaurant (dinner) and the Rainbow Lanai (breakfast). The former was very good but pricey. The latter offered an extensive buffet and one side was open so you had little birds around your feet while you ate. The village had lots of shops suiting all budgets and it was easy to walk around. I found the staff friendly and very helpful. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.","August 26, 2018"
"The overall experience, customer services, amenities and services provided by the Hilton fell way short of my expectations. I did think being a prominent brand that they would invest in their processes and staff but this is clearly not the case. Choose wisely as there are plenty of options far more affordable and better service. ","August 26, 2018"
"In 1985 My wife and I honeymooned at HHV. Based upon great memories we decided to stay there again. Big Mistake.First HHV did not have any King rooms available. We were in Hawaii for our son's wedding and a second honeymoon. We were also running on about 4 hours of sleep out of the last 24. In short we could get into another room earlier than the 3:30 check in time if we paid a 50.00 fee. Yeah that's right, 50.00 to get into a room, not the one you want, but a room, with 2 double beds on a 2nd honeymoon. We were exhausted so that's what we got. You stand in line outside to check in, in what can only be termed as organized chaos. I even tried bribing the check in clerk with a Starbucks card. The clerk was by the book, no breaks no upgrades, no nothing. Customer service is DOA. Now to park your rental car, that will be 43.00 a day. Oh yes, and a resort fee of 37.00 a day and a mysterious 1.74 fee that I never could figure out per day. This is on top of the nearly 250.00 a night room charge, which would have been more had we not booked a package deal through Delta Vacations. The room was a resort view in the Diamond Head Tower on the 13th floor, which actually had a better ocean view than the partial ocean view we had in 1985. The refrigerator is very small but you can keep the basics in it. If you are a big pop or beer drinker or whatever else, I recommend you find a cheap styrofoam cooler and use that. The Ice Machine is a ways down the hall, but, no extra charge! Nice bathroom, nice shower with 4 different settings and the complimentary toiletries were high quality. I have to say that I was impressed by the Housekeeping staff who do understand customer service, and managed to find a fan for us as the A/C wasn't quite up to par. I also want to point out that the groundskeepers do an absolutely incredible job of keeping the place clean and picked up. The disadvantage of the Diamond Head Tower is all the noise you get from the Tapa Pool Bar music and the Rooftop Luau. We had a sound machine which helped, but it was annoying.Pool usage which is about the only useful thing you get for the exorbitant resort fee requires the use of towel cards. One towel per card. You want two towels because you are over 6 feet tall? With some resistance the pool lady relented and gave us two cards each. Maybe we got off on the wrong foot, but she later became my favorite person at the pool. If you want to use a hot tub forget it. Despite signs in multiple languages about age limits and toddlers in the hot tub, a certain ethnicity seems to think the rules don't apply to them. The hot tubs were crammed full of toddlers and kids under age 5. HHV staff make no effort whatsoever to enforce the rules. Feel free to soak in baby stuff, and I'm not talking about sunscreen. Dining: For 24.99, You can get a breakfast of two eggs, two strips of bacon and potatoes. Toast? 5.00 extra. The Tropics has a beautiful view and great service, but breakfast for five with tip was over 127.00. Ridiculous. The other restaurants at the HHV are also over priced with the exception of a tiny Dairy Queen that is jammed packed. Parking: Reviews mentioned that you can avoid the parking fee by using the Marina lot next door. The lot is closed from 10:30 PM to 6:00 AM. Parking is free, but hard to come by. HPD maintains a frequent presence in the lot. In short you are stuck with the parking fee. Uber and Lyft do serve the hotel. On street parking theoretically is available, but you will spend your vacation parking. There is an ABC store in the village and another just outside the village on Ala Moana that we discovered on our last day. Prices were a tiny bit cheaper than the store in the village. If you can, go to a Safeway or Wal-Mart, get breakfast cereal and milk juice etc. Coffee in the room isn't bad, and across from the lobby is a coffee and ice cream place where you can get brewed Kona Coffee and pastries for breakfast also.I will not return to HHV. I would urge anyone to consider other alternatives. It is way overpriced, even for Hawaii and crowded. If you are well off, probably won't be that big a deal, but if you are in the 95%, look elsewhere.","August 24, 2018"
"Our family has been staying at the HHV for the past thirty years. Yes, it has gotten a lot bigger and yes, sometimes check-in can take a while. However, the one thing that has remained constant is the superior customer service. My husband was recently there for a week for a pre-birthday celebration spent riding a Harley around the Island.Sandy and Dawn treated him like family and were quick to respond when a minor room glitch arose. As a longtime HH Diamond member, he was upgraded to a beautiful suite. Sandy and Dawn bring Aloha to the HHV and they both are greatly appreciated!","August 24, 2018"
"This is not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are small and expensive for what you get. More importantly, the check in process is the absolute worst I have ever seen - and I travel all the time for business. The ""exclusivity"" of the Ali'i Tower is meaningless. Because there are so many towers, its like a Disney park in terms of crowds. Over all as a loyal Hilton Traveler I was extremely disappointed.","August 24, 2018"
