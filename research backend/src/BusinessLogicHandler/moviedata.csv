negative,"  ""A Wrinkle in Time"" had talent in its overall gorgeous look. Other than that, it lacks any noticeable strengths at all.While I sat in the theatre, Disney showed a PSA to thank the crew on such a great project, but after I rushed out, all I could think of is how much of a waste it was to have talented people working on such garbage. My rating does not reflect the controversies with the book, but just the movie itself. A Wrinkle in Time over foreshadowed the future, and there was no surprise that I was looking for. I can see how some people can connect with the Mrs.'s, but I personally felt relieved when they left the screen. As weird as it may seem, I and many others struggled to connect with the lead characters, despite their similarities to many other people. In all, connections were lacking, the theme of the story was an extremely non-risky move, and the rest of the departments in the film struggled to make such a poor idea good. I hope that we can somehow move such amazing resources in the industry to work on stories that we can all enjoy.",A Wrinkle in Time,3092

negative,"  ""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" (PG-13, 1:47) is a biblical drama directed and co-written by Andrew Hyatt (""Full of Grace"", ""The Last Light"", ""The Frozen""), featuring an international cast which includes experienced actors from both film and television. The plot centers around the writing of the biblical book of Acts.The film opens with Jim Caviezel (who famously played Jesus in 2004's ""The Passion of the Christ""), as the apostle Luke, arriving in Rome as the Christian believers in the capital are suffering constant persecution under Emperor Nero - and the apostle Paul (James Faulkner) sits in prison awaiting his execution as an enemy of the empire. After conferring with Aquilla (John Lynch) and Priscilla (Joanne Whaley), the leaders of one Christian community in hiding, and tending to the medical needs of their people, Luke visits Paul. Aided by a prison guard, Luke starts paying regular visits under cover of night.Luke convinces Paul that the world needs the encouragement of hearing his story and Paul starts dictating what would later become known in the Bible as the Acts of the Apostles. This allows for brief flashbacks showing the journey of Saul of Tarsus (played by Yorgos Karamihos) from merciless persecutor of Christians to the loving, faithful imprisoned leader of the church. We also get to hear conversations between the two church fathers about the past, present and future of their faith. Even though a man named Mauritius (Olivier Martinez), the Roman officer in charge of the prison, learns of Luke's visits, he allows them to continue because he sees no harm in any of it - and he is intrigued by Paul and Luke, even as he prays and sacrifices to the Roman gods for the life of his sick daughter. As Luke continues to visit Paul, Aquilla and Priscilla struggle to keep their community together and safe in the face of the threat of violence (ranging from being beaten by Roman soldiers to literally being thrown to the lions) and internal disagreements about whether to stay in Rome or flee - and whether to answer Nero's persecution with the love Jesus preached or the more practical response of violence.""Paul, Apostle of Christ"" is an interesting and high-quality, but often dull portrayal of a pivotal period in early church history. In spite of the film's title, the amount of screen time devoted to Paul makes him little more than a supporting player in his own story. The script excels at character development, but contains little action, in spite of the abundance of drama which we know existed at this time and place. As ""talky"" as this film is, however, the performances are solid across the board - and particularly outstanding from the main actors - while the production values throughout the film are very high. Of course, we can legitimately question the historicity of the developments portrayed given that the filmmakers relied solely on biblical accounts, without the benefit of more objective histories. This film's strengths are its acting and its technical achievements. ""B-""",Paul Apostle of Christ,7795
negative,"  ""The Death of Stalin"" (R, 1:46) is a British political satire comedy, co-written and directed by Armando Iannucci, based on a French graphic novel, about the events leading up to, surrounding and immediately following the 1953 demise of Joseph Stalin, the long-time leader of the U.S.S.R. You might well wonder whether the violence of the Soviet dictator's regime would be appropriate fodder for a comedy film, or whether such a comedy could even work. Fair questions and, after watching this film, I'd say valid ones.The film opens with a dinner party thrown by Stalin (Adrian McLoughlin) and attended by his inner circle of Nikita Khrushchev and Georgy Malenkov (Golden Globe and Emmy winners Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor), Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Vyacheslav Molotov (Monty Python veteran Michael Palin). During that gathering, Stalin causes a minor panic by in a concert hall by personally asking for a recorded copy of that night's performance, and panic also comes to various individuals around Moscow as Stalin's security forces go after those on his most recent enemies list, as published by Beria. All of this tells us a lot about the main characters and Stalin's regime and nicely sets the stage for what is to come.The rest of the movie concerns itself with the titular event and its aftermath, focusing on the comical inefficiency of the Soviet regime and backstabbing among its high-ranking officials. After the aforementioned dinner party, after Stalin reads some hate mail sent to him by an idealistic and gutsy musician (Olga Kurylenko), then has a medical episode and collapses. Over the next 12 hours or so, Stalin's personal security detail, various government officials and a motley crew of doctors who are eventually called, all bungle their responses and Stalin dies. Then Stalin's children, a naÔve drama queen (Andrea Riseborough) and an unhinged alcoholic (Emmy nominee Rupert Friend) show up, adding to the mayhem, followed quickly by the self-important Soviet Army chief, Field Marshall Zhukov (Jason Isaacs). Meanwhile, the men in the dead dictator's inner circle jockey for power and scheme against each other.""The Death of Stalin"" is clever, but not as funny as it wants to be. The movie tries to walk the fine line between taking the events it depicts somewhat seriously and showing the ridiculousness of the Soviet system in the early-mid 1950s and the men who ran it. The film walks that line well, but in doing so, fails to be very entertaining. The tragic historical facts of Stalin's murderous regime and the way its inefficiency fueled the Cold War with the United States makes the jokes less funny, but the nods to the seriousness of those situations keep the jokes from going far enough to be funnier. Despite the excellent cast, that middle-of-the-road approach to making a comedy about Stalin's death results in a middle-of-the-road grade from me, teetering on the edge of whether to recommend this movie or not... but barely coming down on the side of not.

negative,"  ""Tomb Raider"" (PG-13, 1:58) is a reboot of the erstwhile Angelina Jolie franchise (with 2001 and 2003 ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" films). All the movies are based on the British ""Tomb Raider"" action-adventure video game series, which came on the scene in 1996. Like the games, the movies have used various combinations of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Lara Croft"" (the franchises' central character) in their titles. Naming tweaks aside, the question is if the 2018 changes in casting & approach pay off for Movie Fans. While Jolie's casting and portrayal matched the look and attitude of the video game heroine, Oscar winner Alicia Vikander brings a leaner and less mean Lara Croft to the big screen. Jolie brought the bad-ass female archaeologist/adventurer to life with a lot of swagger, but Vikander's Croft is more physically and emotionally vulnerable, full of fight, but yet to realize her potential, intellectually or in practice. The quality both characterizations share is intelligence and guts, but 2018's ""Tomb Raider"" is an origin story.Seven years after the disappearance of her father, wealthy businessman and adventurer Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), Lara is a woman with no plan. Obviously intelligent, she's content trying to be a mixed martial artist and working as a bicycle messenger. She wouldn't have to work at all, if she would just sign the documents declaring her father legally dead so she can inherit his company and his fortune, but she's having a very hard time letting go of the hope that her father, whom she idolizes, is still alive.When company officer (and Lara's former legal guardian), Ana Miller (Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas), finally convinces Lara to swing by the office and sign those papers, Lara receives a Japanese puzzle box that her father left her. Solving the puzzle leads Lara to the discovery of what her father was really working on when he disappeared - trying to find the tomb of a legendary Japanese queen who supposedly possessed the power of life and death. Still hoping to find her father alive (or at least learn what happened to him), the clues lead Lara to Japan where she hires a reluctant but down-on-his-luck boat captain (Daniel Wu) to take her into the Devil's Sea to a remote island which is notoriously difficult to reach. Upon reaching the island, Lara discovers the ruthless Mathias Vogel (Emmy nominee Walter Goggins) leading an expedition to find the tomb for a mysterious international organization.Vikander's ""Tomb Raider"" (directed by Roar Uthaug) is a joyless, by-the-numbers actioner. In spite of Vikander's considerable talent and gravitas, she feels miscast as the tough and determined young adventurer. With the understanding that this is a Lara Croft origin story, it just becomes mind-numbing to see her beaten up throughout the movie, while none of the actors' performances rise about the level of serviceable. The script (by Evan Daugherty and Geneva Robertson-Dworet) features unnecessary dialog, characters whose motivations make little sense and a story which is mostly very predictable. Disappointing.

They turned aliens into a cheap fashion show. Rainbows. An awkward emotional alien-rape scene. Some of the acting was cringe-worthy, though the script definitely was the primary reason it came across as forced. Did I mention rainbow flares? They even put them in night scenes! They're so overused you can't even make a drinking game out of it. Also, why did they have to show Natalie Portman cheating on her husband and antagonize her with no resolution whatsoever.

negative,"  *SPOILERS*VISUALLY, a strikingly beautiful and stunning pastiche of better films. A painfully obvious direct ripoff and patchwork reassembly of SPLASH and the Dutch short film THE SPACE BETWEEN US. Even the title of the short film is perfectly echoed in one of the feature film's most iconic shots. Even the recurring verdant sets clearly derivative of Edward Hopper's ""The Nighthawks"", which I kept expecting to see as an Easter egg on a wall. Unfortunately, this flagrant copy breaks no new ground in terms of storytelling. The plot feel and characterization are remarkably shallow. The underlying MESSAGE, strongly anti-white, anti-capitalist, and anti-Christian. The utterly detestable Michael Shannon plays the villain, who is painstakingly painted as a married white Christian male. We got it. And as a cheat, a hypocrite, a racist, a sadist, a misogynist, and a rapey sexual pervert. He despises women, even as he uses them only for sexual gratification and menial labor. He commits anti-Christian acts at every turn whilst paying lip service to God. He is so racist that even his blackening, gangrenous fingers offend him so much he rips them off his body. THEMATICALLY, strong arcs of bestiality and homosexuality complete the anti-Christian mix. Even the mechanism of copulation between fish-man and human-fish-woman was carefully described to make sure we couldn't miss it. A gratuitous masturbation scene was thrown in, presumably to make us understand Sally Hawkins' character was lonely and rejected. We got it. The pro-Communist theme completed by the hero of the film being a Russian communist spy. The American military depicted as crude, unthinking fascists bent on jingoism and evil-doing. The lonely outcasts of society were showcased and denigrated aplenty, with a particularly gruesome mockery of mute persons.STRUCTURALLY, a shot-for-shot ripoff of the aforementioned films, with storyboards you could lay on top of each other and identically trace. The twist was obvious from the beginning, and the entire film very predictable.ACTING was top shelf. Octavia Spencer was her typical likeable and comedic self and did a very fine job. Sally Hawkins and the rest of the cast were also excellent.Highly overrated, with the thefts and warts overlooked due to the trending politically correct anti-American and anti-Christian themes, and other SJW-ish factors. It would be far more enjoyable to one who is blind to, or agrees with its messages, and who has never seen SPLASH and doesn't know about the blatant theft from the short film.

negative,"  *Spoilers. Where to start with this piece of work? There were a lot of underdeveloped/pointless new characters and I would argue old characters (from pre-disney) didn't live up to their potential (Luke Skywalker, Leia). Some costumes (Such as Holdo's dress) didn't fit the scenes. A lot of hypocritical actions like Leia pushing responsibility for military deaths onto Poe for actions she had the authority and awareness to stop (when Poe led a successful assault to destroy a lethal threat) or when Rose stopped Finn from committing suicide to protect the resistance and then telling him that the only way to win is to protect the people he loves (which is what he was trying to do and almost did, Rose literally almost got the resistance killed). First Order are childish villains and would be lacking punch if it weren't for the resistance being just as incompetent (First Order are supposed to be a military, yet their general is literally toyed with in the opening scene by an idiot, like an idiot). Old characters are literally killed in the most lacklustre ways. Epic Rey training montage missing. Phasma exists, and then doesn't. Snoke exists, kind of reveals his grand plan, stops existing because Deus Ex Machina. To finish, CANTO BITE (Oh god why was this even recorded).

I love how they're portraying the villains as easily duped by ppl other than special forces... doesn't that take away from the ""heroism"" of the kidnapping?Yes, they're so quick to relate to anyone different....except, you know, the one-dimensional nazis the kill.A cold war movie where the creature & the soviet are the good guys. This is not by accident.And of course, the old familiar morally pure animal trope watching human evil in horror. Of course, the white nuclear family is the one where things are awry. Thank you, hollywood, for defending us from the horrors of suburbia.Bottom line, you can dress up crap, but it's still crap. Even if it's Academy awarded. This is nothing more than fish porn.

negative,"  15 years ago, when the original ""A Wrinkle in Time"" came out in 2003, the author, Madeleine L'Engle, knew that it was going to be bad before the negative reviews came out. Now with Ava DuVernay's adaptation of this ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" I seriously don't think that's going to change her mind about this, (if she was still here). The film is more underwhelming than 2012's ""John Carter"" and 2015's ""Tomorrowland,"" and the results are a weird mess. It's very easy to see that DuVernay did the best she can by bringing this classic novel to the big screen, but there are numerous of problems that are impossible to ignore.The film focuses on Meg Murry (Storm Reid), an outcast who lives with her mother, Dr. Kate Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who you may recognize her from the critical acclaimed episode of ""Black Mirror"" and most recently, ""The Cloverfield Paradox""), and her intelligent brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Four years ago, Meg and Charles Wallace's father, Dr. Alex Murry, (Chris Pine) has disappeared without a trace, and Meg's been feeling nothing but pain, sadness, and doubt after that. Later, she, Charles Wallace, and their friend, Calvin O' Keefe (Levi Miller), encounters three mysterious travelers, Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling) and lastly Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), and together they travel through different planets and universes to find their father.Let me just break down the problems with the film. The first problem is the soundtrack. I have admit to myself that I really like ""Pete's Dragon"" for its performances and the heart of the film, but if there's one complaint I have with the film, it's the soundtrack. I thought some of the songs don't seem to click in the film, and even I said the same with ""Suicide Squad,"" which its soundtrack was one of the real reasons why I hated the film. The soundtrack in ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" (which features new songs by Sade, Demi Lovato, and more), is nothing to be impressed. I'm not saying that the songs are bad, but they don't seem to work with the film.The second problem is the special effects. While some of the settings look pretty colorful to look at, the CGI effects, for the most part, looks unimpressive. The first time you see Oprah Winfrey as a 30-foot tall woman is really strange, (which I will explain more about the performances later). Then, there's a particular moment where we see our main characters have landed themselves on a planet, and we see flowers flying around; it reminded me of something in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" (which I'm not a huge fan of that movie). Next, you see Reese Witherspoon transforming herself into a flying creature, and it's, once again, very strange to look at it. I would say there were a couple cool moments when it came down to the special effects, (which both of them happened near the end of the film), though.The third problem is the way how they developed these characters. I thought the introduction of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which felt silly to me. Back to what I was saying about Oprah Winfrey, I find myself uncomfortable when I see her as a giant in this film, (although she wasn't always like that in the entire film). I'm not saying it's a bad performance by her, but it's definitely not her best one in my opinion, (even though I do like her in general). As with Meg and her family, they're actually quite possibly the best part of the film. The interaction between Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as husband and wife is nice, and so does the interaction between him and Storm Reid as father and daughter. It's just a shame that the film doesn't offer more insights on these characters.Storm Reid is terrific as Meg. She delivers every soul and energy in her character, and the way she performed onscreen is mind-blowing. I seriously cannot wait to see more films that have her in it. Some people, (such as Chris Stuckmann), have criticized Deric McCabe's performance as Charles Wallace, but for me I thought he was okay. I mean, watching him (spoiled alert) playing the dark side of his character, (which it happens near the end of the film), isn't perfect, but I do think he's got talent nevertheless. Levi Miller (""Better Watch Out"" and ""Jasper Jones"") does his best, but the film doesn't give him that much to do when he was playing the role of Calvin.I would have had a better experience with ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" if the story and characters were properly done. Or maybe if I didn't read the novel, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I do think director Ava DuVernay is a wonderful filmmaker, and I like what she has to say in all of her movies, but I think I prefer if she keeps making more movies like ""Selma."" There are so many things I can't ignore in this film. The story is messy, the pacing is inconsistent, the editing is choppy, the writing is flawed and uneven, and the execution, (especially when it pulls out its message about love), feels flat and unconvincing. My full opinion: 5.1/10.",A Wrinkle in Time,3289

negative,"  2 Star Review:Years after her father's disappearance, Meg Murray comes across three celestial beings, who have traveled the universe to help Meg, her brother and her classmate find her father. A Wrinkle in Time is definitely a sight to behold. Throughout the film, the audience is treated to a visual spectacle with panoramic grandeur. At times, the film shines through to deliver to us the message of accepting oneself regardless of what flaws we think we may have and using that power of self worth to overcome the obstacles in life. The film, however, ends up trying too hard to convey that message and it doesn't help having the 3 celestial beings dressed up the way they are with all that makeup which adds a layer of campiness to movie that otherwise wants to be taken seriously. The acting is distracting during certain key moments along with clunky dialogue. While the film is to be commended for aiming high with such a powerful theme, it doesn't nearly reach the heights it was aiming for.",A Wrinkle in Time,3241

negative,"  89% of audience enjoyed this??? Really? I must be out of touch with reality or the demographics of the audience have changed. I used to prioritize my viewing based on RT scores and other indicators, but this is yet another example of why I need to change my watching philosophy. The original Jumanji was fun, entertaining, etc. I could not help but think that this movie was primarily targeted for the teen-age crowd with little to entertain anyone over the mental age of 17. I like the actors individually and there were a couple (and only a couple) good lines (mostly delivered by Kevin Hart who was obviously the comic relief character). But the entire premise, execution, and plot was flat and did nothing to pique my interest. It is true that most sequels are poor attempts to capitalize of the popularity of the original, and this lives up to that. My advise: If you are over the mental age of 17, don't bother unless you don't mind plopping down $6 on cable and wasting almost two hours of your life. I'm sorry for the review, but I wish Hollywood (or Japan or China or whoever has bought the movie studios most recently) would focus more on plot, character development, and WRITING over cheap gags and special effects.",Jumanji,6232

negative,"  A fantasy what if movie. Attractive characters running around with no real focus or story. The whole thing comes off as a social justice psa with a watered down marvel twist. The movie does not leave any room or opening for any other super heros from the marvel franchise. This leads me to believe this will be another Edward Norton (Hulk) or Tobey Maguire (Spiderman) movie that will be remade and re-released to tweak the story to fit the franchise and hopefully get some substance. Basically a small portion of Africa has the same protective bubble that the Amazon s have in wonder woman...(real original). Inside the bubble are 5 tribes that basically fight for the right to rule the bubble. They have advanced technology and super smarts the perfect facade of Utopia. But all the advanced tools and tech is not enough to get them out of the tribal mindset so they have to fight and challenge to find the one man worthy to be King and thus the black panther. Surprised feminist haven't started rioting on that account. But to their credit they royal soldier force are made of woman. So long story short real history happens outside the bubble and the 5 tribes do nothing to circumvent things like slavery. Then in 92 a prince gets killed in America leaving an orphaned boy to be raised by the system. Turns out the boy does really well for himself is promoted through the us military and decides he wants the bubble for himself and then the world because he feels all black people are still slaves. He confronts the king of the bubble whose response is that black people in other countries are not citizens of the bubble just because of their skin color and thus not a priority. So the boy gets mad steals the throne for a few days with plans to liberate every black person around the world and end the colonization control. Anyone not black is seen as a colonizer and thus is oppressive to anyone black. As a stand alone movie I think it works, but if it's held up to the franchise, it is severely lacking.",Black Panther,2531

Almost every joke is a running gag which started out not being funny and then proceeds to be run into the ground. The obligatory quirky sidekick is little more than a repetitive annoyance, most of the characters are cheap stereotypes, the ending can be guessed within minutes, and the film breaks out its dance montage within 20 minutes. John Cena does his best, but he's playing the lead character who wants to do their own thing despite everyone else telling them to conform, which seems to be the default status for every children's film protagonist, and it does absolutely nothing new with this premise.

negative,"  A rarity for me being so baffled by a movie; I highly anticipated A Wrinkle In Time from the moment I heard it was in production. Then came the amazing first teaser trailer which captivated me more in 1 min and 50 secs then the entire movie did. This was set to be a poignant movie experience and perhaps was, but not in the manner that I had expected. Walking into this movie I wanted to be transcended with emotion and evoked with deep thought, deep adventure and deep story telling considering the amazing cast featuring none other then Oprah. This was a poignant experience, but more of one that left me confused, unfulfilled and dumbfounded. All that deepness I hoped was left wading in shallow waters. Not having read the book I went to this with pure movie mindset and walked out thinking I may need to read the book to get even an ounce of what this story was. Major, and I do mean major, plot holes are all over the place in this movie that lacks any kind of depth to what is being told. The climax of the movie is perhaps the worst part of it all. Its much of a Alice in Wonderland story, however the journey is no where near as fun and charismatic. Kudos to the wonderful cast, however they could have pushed their characters a bit more. One gripping emotional moment shared between two characters/actors does bring you into the movie one extra much needed level. This movie left me so unsure of what to think that Im even more unsure of how to critique it or my thoughts of it. With all that said Im curious of its Rewatchability factor. If I see this on TV down the road would I tune in? Thats where my intrigue peaks itself. Watching it again I may be forgiving of the plot holes or the distributing climax. The journey is simple and could make for an easy movie to tune into at any point ,have on, and not need to pay close attention to while doing stuff around the house. For that it might make it worth the rewatch for the emotional, but short, moment during the climax. Basically, wading in shallow waters can be relaxing.

negative,"  A Wrinkle in Time does contain some impressive visual, but storywise it is very incoherent. Sometimes it comes off as a string of unrelated scenes edited together. The acting is very bad, for the most part. Storm Reid actually does do a good job in her role. The characters aren't very well fleshed out. Calvin, in particular, just randomly appears and serves no further purpose to the film. He just tags along. The message was great, but I wish they took a more subtle approach. Instead, they beat you over the head with it. Ava DuVernay seemed to have good intentions her, you know what they say about good intentions. Unfortunately, this film does not deliver and is a huge misfire. Can't recommend anyone see this film.",A Wrinkle in Time,3157
negative,"  A Wrinkle in Time is based on a beloved children's classic published in 1961. It's directed by Ava DuVernay, who was responsible for Selma, one of the best films of 2014. There's a reason that Marvel offered her the directing gig for Black Panther. This film has big names, a big budget, and big talent behind the camera with a focus on upping the inclusion at the Mouse House... so why is the movie so unfortunately awful? A Wrinkle in Time is one of the worst experiences I've had in a theater. I was so thoroughly unattached that I started questioning how something this bad was so beloved for decades by different generations of, what I must now assume, children with terrible taste.Meg (Storm Reid) is a teenager still dealing with the pain and anger from the four-year disappearance of her father, Mr. Murry (Chris Pine). He was a scientist trying to discover a new form of space-time travel powered by... love, I think. Mrs. Murry (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is stuck trying to rear he troublesome daughter and Meg's adopted little brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe). Then one day they and Meg's crush, Calvin (Levi Miller), are visited by a trio of strange, powerful (aliens? witches? fairies? spirits?) women: Mrs. Which (Oprah Winfrey), Mrs. Who (Mindy Kaling), and Mrs. Whatsit (Reese Witherspoon). They inform Meg and company that they know where her father is. They must travel the universe to save him, battle the source of negativity, The It (no relation to Stephen King), and maybe learn a thing or two about accepting one's true self, faults and all.Oprah as Dragonball Z?A Wrinkle in Time is simultaneously over complicated and meaninglessly shallow. I was baffled throughout the entirely of its near two-hour running time trying to make sense of anything. The story felt like it was written by computer that had been programmed with the scraps of genre storytelling as an exercise. There is no real internal logic that holds everything together, which makes every moment feel arbitrary. The story also lacks another vital aspect every fantasy movie needs - clarity. The goal is for the kids to find and rescue Mr. Murry, but every step leading to this goal feels unclear. Scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment, you don't have any clue how what they are doing will lead them any closer to achieving this goal. Every scene just asserts itself, and then something happens, and then something else happens, and then it's done. Hey one minute the kids are going to talk with flowers because, for whatever reason, they're the little gossips of the plant world. Then Mrs. Whatsit turns into a plant mantis goddess giant. Then the kids hop on her back and fly, and then fly on her while she's also flying, and then one kid falls off, so whoops, but the gossipy plants catch him. And then none of that matters. Even the villain is a nebulous concept of negativity designed to link up with a character's personal journey. There's a plot insofar as stuff happens and then it doesn't. The rules of this universe are never properly established. Anything is just anything in this movie. The final planet, where they do indeed find Mr. Murry, could just have easily been their first stop. If a fantasy movie doesn't properly orient the audience to its world and rules, it's only a matter of time before that same audience checks out, frustrated and uninterested.Afterwards, I did something I hardly ever do and ventured to read the Wikipedia summary to discover what was in the original story by author Madeline L'Engle. Surely the screenwriters must have butchered this oft-touted children's classic. To my surprise, the summary of the book is pretty close to what ends up in DuVernay's film, with some slight modernizing and name changing (I wonder why DuVernay might not have wanted the Big Evil Source of All Negativity to be called ""The Black Thing."" Hmmm.). I think maybe the book was never good but was liked by kids, and then they remembered it being better and passed it along to their kids, and so on and so on, until somebody finally runs screaming through the streets, trying to get everyone to realize the harsh reality.Another factor that doesn't seem developed or helpful or fulfilling are the three magical beings played by Oprah, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon. It feels like they're more award show hosts constantly changing their wardrobes than characters. They offer very Oprah-like self-help platitudes about acceptance, courage, and self-actualization. I felt sympathy for each actress being wasted, in particular Kaling, who speaks only in quotes and a plethora of reaction shots where she practices a wise expression. Witherspoon is definitely overdoing it and Oprah has settled into being talk show Oprah. They felt like rejects from a discarded Alice in Wonderland movie but with less personality. I think you could cut all three out of the film completely. The only meaningful way these three characters impact the plot is as expositional devices, but even that is whimsical nonsense.Speaking of exposition, oh boy is this script really bad when it comes to dialogue. There's an early scene that exists purely to inform the audience about the Murry children and to be eavesdropped upon by Charles Wallace (that name deserves to belong to a tax attorney or a serial killer). ""She's smart but hasn't been the same since her dad left,"" says one teacher. ""Yeah, but that little brother of hers, he's got potential but he sure is weird."" The conversation feels painfully inauthentic and transparent. Don't these teachers have other students of equal interest at the school to discuss? The Murry children's father disappeared four years ago and they're still talking about them this sloppily? The final film is stuffed with these moments, with characters transparently telling the each other who they are or how they should feel at all times. The pointless romantic sidekick, Calvin, is literally introduced as coming over and saying, ""Hey I sorta know you from school, and I felt like I should be here,"" as if he could feel the screenplay calling him. Also, Meg just happens to live next door to her chief bully in school, who is still bullying her every day for whatever reason. It's been four freaking years since her father left, and apparently this still offends this girl on a daily basis? Most of the dialogue made me wince.It will sound mean but we need to talk about the bad child acting in A Wrinkle in Time. In the modern age, after Room, It, and The Florida Project in particular, there really is no excuse for bad child acting. If you cannot feature quality child actors, you aren't looking hard enough or that may be a fault of the director's own abilities. McCabe (Stephanie) is, in particular, a bad choice to carry much of the movie's emotional climax at the end. He even gets possessed by the Bad Negative Force and must channel menace. It comes across more like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum in a store. Much of the conclusion hinges on tight close-ups of McCabe bellowing. It's unfortunate for everyone. Reid (12 Years a Slave) fares a little better but is relatively inexpressive, going even beyond the general withdrawn nature of her character. Miller's (Pan) character serves no purpose. He offers no skill or breakthrough for the plot. He is just there, blank-faced, and providing PG-rated prepubescent romantic tension. Or perhaps Meg really needs to hear the strong encouragement from the voice of an attractive white male in order to finally personally succeed?DuVernay's direction has some nice, sweeping visuals but the movie as a whole feels far more awkward and misapplied with its budget. Some of the special effects are shockingly shoddy for this kind of major release from Disney. The fantasy worlds feel like holdovers from other fantasy movies with little memorable distinction. There is one effective moment visually that stands supreme, and that's when the trio encounter a suburban neighborhood populated with Children of the Damned-style kids all bouncing balls in sync. Their individual mothers come out and march in the same eerie synchronicity, and it's the best-conceived and executed piece in the film. It's also one of the few sequences where the editing is a benefit. The editing is conspicuously poor. Early on, when Mrs. Whatsit had first introduced herself, every cut failed to match, every camera movement created a disconnect of space, and it generally felt off. It didn't get better from there. When you notice the editing, unless you're in a Scorsese or Aranofsky movie, it's a bad sign.In many ways, this film reminds me of the misguided, flabbergasting, and fascinating failed passion project that was 2014's A Winter's Tale. I could dissect that movie and its multitudinous of wrong-ness for hours. With A Wrinkle in Time, I just wanted to leave. I wanted to enjoy the movie and root for DuVernay being given the reins of a major studio film. I loved Selma and diversity behind the camera is hard to come by in Hollywood, let alone a woman of color given this sort of platform. Sadly, it feels like DuVernay wasn't quite ready. A Wrinkle in Time gave me nothing to engage with early on. I didn't care about the characters, the plot felt like it was being made up as it went, the rules were unclear, the dialogue was inauthentic, there was no sense of momentum, and when it does accidentally stumble into something slightly interesting, it quickly moves along again. It's about the power of love overcoming the power of negativity. I don't know whom this movie is for. Children will be bored. Adults will shrug. This movie doesn't work on a fundamental level and it left me bored. I closed my eyes and dreamed of a better movie but it never came to be. My dear father, who had the misfortune of enduring this experience with me, turned to me during the end credits and said, ""I am now going to treat you... by taking you far away from this movie."" It's that bad, folks.Nate's Grade: D",A Wrinkle in Time,2955
negative,"  A Wrinkle in Time is directed by Ava Duvernay and stars Storm Reid, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Levi Miller, Deric McCabe, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Pena and Chris Pine.The story is of Meg who loses her scientist father. He was experimenting with this strange idea he had that you could bend the universe and travel light-years in seconds.When three strange beings arrived in Meg backyard Mrs. Which Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who. Meg her Brother and Friend go off on an adventure through time and space to try and find her father.This is a visually stunning film sometimes and then sometimes it is also fairly horrible looking. There is no escaping it, some of the special effects and green-screen are extremely noticeable and they're not quite as impressive as I think this film thinks they are; especially for a Disney production.There are some very touching scenes most of them involving Meg's family, you really do feel a sense of warmth in their household and when her father disappears you feel for character. But from the first act to the third act the story is such a jumbled mess, it felt like the movie was missing something after the touching opening. That was the human touch, after the first act the film was just really a lot of Wow sequences that didn't really land.When it comes to the Children leading the film all three give good performances for the most part, Storm Reid who plays Meg is fairly good in the movie especially in some of the more emotional scenes, she doesn't really show a lot of surprise when the awe-inspiring moments are happening before her eyes which was a little strange, but she is very good as an awkward young girl who is not comfortable with her own self yet.Her younger brother Charles Wallace started off strong then a lot of focus was on his character neither the end and sadly this is where he fell off.But the over reliance of the younger cast pushes a lot of them to one side, some of them just get one or two scenes in the movie which was incredibly disappointing to see.I think there's a chance that kids today will see this movie and it will be there Hook, Hook was critically pan by critics in 1991, but kids from that era love it. This could be this generations Hook.",A Wrinkle in Time,3094
negative,"  A Wrinkle in Time is director Ava DuVernay's first time helming a large budget feature after her success with 2014's Selma, and it also marks the first time a live-action film with a $100M+ production budget has been helmed by a woman of colour. A Wrinkle in Time is very ambitious and harbours a grand scope with a story that explores the unseen parts of the universe. Unfortunately the execution isn't great and it doesn't leave behind a whole lot to be enjoyed. The plot follows young Meg (Storm Reid) who after the disappearance of her father (Chris Pine) is visited by three mystical beings and embarks on an adventure through the universe to find him. The scope of the story is very large whilst also remaining focused on a small group of characters so despite the fact that it misses beats a lot of the time there is stuff in here I did like. The visuals are a definite strong point, very crisp and clear, and Meg's story actually does have a fair amount of heart and emotion going for it and it helps in offering something to keep you awake. But the negatives heavily outweigh the positives so even when it exhibits good things it still feels held back by everything else.†I'll begin with the characters because where I loved Meg's personal journey through the film and her overall development, I wasn't really invested in any of the other characters aside from how they help Meg grow into her own. The path she takes through here is very engaging and its a journey all about family, love, and accepting who you are on the inside and out so her story individual story has a strong message to it. The relationship with her younger brother and her missing father is a well executed dynamic here and gives the film a lot of heart and a couple of strong emotional scenes you genuinely care about. But all of the other characters don't really have any individual arcs or growth, more or less the people they are at the outset is who they are when the credits roll. They serve their role in strengthening Meg's character but there wasn't really anything about them to latch onto. Her younger brother Charles Wallace played by very well by Deric McCabe¬†is the most engaging of the rest of the cast but that's due to his very unique 'out there' personality being quite the opposite to everyone else in here. The three beings played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey are fine, I didn't really enjoy watching them specifically but they bother me that much. They're vessels used to drive the plot forward and say motivational things to Meg, so they're there but they're not interesting characters.¬†And then there's Calvin, Levi Miller's character whose name I had to look up and whose overall purpose in this story is pretty non-existent. He kind of just shows up at one point and joins the adventure but we don't know who he is and it's almost as if Meg doesn't know really who he is but he sticks around anyway. His character just feels so damn forced into this story like he was shoved in just for some sort of clich√© romantic angle because he doesn't really do anything. And I've got nothing against Levi's performance, I feel like he plays the character as he has been instructed it's just that there isn't a place in the story for him which is why he just floats around. The rest of the performances are all very fine, Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw included, it's just the writing of these characters and the way they do or don't play into the story which is very subpar.¬†The overall story and physical journey the characters take through the universe fails to be engaging at almost any moment. As I mentioned, aside from Meg's personal story there's nothing of value to really grasp onto. The pacing is completely out of whack, the initial setup moves so fast it's hard to follow and leads to further issues, then later on large chunks of the film slow down to where it occasionally becomes a bit of a bore. The biggest problem stemming from the opening act being so rushed is a lot of the character decisions and reactions to certain events don't come across as very genuine, like the writers have just had characters accept certain things that I'd expect one would be questioning profusely. It also begins at a point where it feels like there's a lot of missing information, especially with Charles Wallace whose journey is already underway when Meg's story begins, some of this becomes clearer with time but it's all still a bit iffy. So many sequences just drag on and slow the film down drastically. For instance, one location they visit where they meet a character played by Zach Galifianakis¬†is eternally boring, the film screeches to a halt and it takes a bit to break out of that lull which is a shame. There is an antagonistic presence in here as is expected, but I still don't understand it and exactly what or why or how it is. I won't go into detail about it to withhold spoilers but it's just weirdly conveyed.¬†So in the end, Ava DuVernay's first venture into the world of big budget fantasy adventures hasn't really gone to plan but she does some good things in here and she's more than proven her talents as a director in the past so I'm looking forward to her next project. Storm Reid is the strongest link in here and her performance brings a tonne of heart and emotion and beauty to the story where no-one else really does to the same level. Her growth over time is one of only things about the story I could grab onto and enjoy following, but despite it being good it's not enough to hold up the rest of the film. The performances are all fine and the visuals exceptional but with the lacklustre story and characters it's hard to really recommend the movie. As a casual watch I feel there might be just enough in here that a family audience can enjoy but don't expect that exciting of a fantasy adventure.¬†4/10",A Wrinkle in Time,2979

Though visually stunning, this movie has so many aspects that caused it to become one of the most mediocre movies that the mouse house has ever brought to theaters. Many important parts of the book were cut out in the final film, including my personal favorite character, Aunt Beast. The film also was very choppy, and left you to imagine what was actually happening a majority of the time. To be honest, most of the movie was made of emotional moments. This took away from the whole adventerous spirit A Wrinkle In Time was supposed to have. And as a plus, most of the acting towards the end was so shameless that it felt as if the actors were mad that they participated in this mess themselves!

She's shut herself out from others and other kids and adults don't show her much sympathy. But soon three magical women show up and they tell Meg that her father discovered a new way to travel to places that are a long way away. However he gets stuck in that stuck in that distant place for the past four years.  Meg and her brother, Charles - along with a friend, Calvin, rush off to a strange and far away land to find and rescue him. On the first stop in their journey, the women tell our heroes about a creature called ""the It"" (note: not Pennywise).

But Meg isn't leaving without her father - even if she has to face her greatest fears and take on her biggest challenges.SCORINGMain Characters These three are okay.

I would've like a better explanation as to why Calvin comes along on this trip.

Oh yes, no one uses the Force, only sword fight and take each other in a sweatbox, WTFLeah should have died in SW8 - instead of becoming a supergirl :-(You save animals but not slave children, niceDisney: You make rich people bad (casino plot) since you're poor?The new Star Wars should be - not only black and white - Here all men are stupid and all women are clever ?Beware BB-8 aka - the new Terminator - shoots coins, more than he is tall - funny ? NOAll characters are exactly 2.5 hours where they were at the beginning :-(The mighty Snok is dead? I do not care I do not really know him!The good thing is from now on, you can do all threatening things like dead stars, spaceships, evil planet, the new order, destroy by autopilot and hyper jump :-) We do not need Jedi more, and that just where everyone can become a Jedi, without effort, training, history, personal experiences and teachers ... :-(Look first Rogue One then a new Hope - and then SW7 / SW8 - you understand about Storyline?Good CGI technology does not replace a good story - it supports the storyWhat does Mark Hamill say about his new Luke role? It's not Luke's characterLuke Skywalker is so iconic that Mark Hamill only had voice roles in Hollywood movies since 1983. His 3 minutes in SW7 TFA was goose bumps with me. And now he dissolves in the air ???I am so sad Mark - I think of you as you were in my childhood, the greatest hero of all time :-)) May the force be with you ....ps: do not go back to Disney Star Wars.To Kathleen Kennedy :You look for strong women, look at 1977 - 83, Princess Lea was strong, she was not scared for Darth Vader, while everyone around him was shaking, she actively helps with her rescue. She is tortured by Darth Vader and later becomes active again in the fight for the rebelion. She strangles the mighty Jaba with her bare hands and a chain. She is always at the very front when fighting with laser pistols.R.I.P Carrie Fisheror... Felicity Jones aka Jyn Erso in Rogue One, I think I have seen that she is a strong woman and has grown with her duties. AND she had to teach, seek to make decisions, make decisions until her death - I felt with her!or think of Ripley aka Sigourney Weaver in Alien 1979And now there is - I can do anything right now Rey ... what a Stroyline. What did you want to tell the youth Disney?Hey kids life is great - everyone has the Force to use them without teaching, they bring you cola, chips and the joystick into your hands while you sit on the sofa, do not bother and do not forget to buy our toys :-)Look at the little boy at the end of the movie, he uses the power for his broom. Anakin was also a slave boy but what did he need to become jedi ???? Ahhhh years of training ....How do colored actors need political correctness - who is Billy Dee Williams - SW2 TESB 1980?By the way, how great would it have been if instead of Benicio Del Toro had played the hacker :-)Let the past die, kill it if you have to, said Disney :-) Well, congratulations you've killed the old premiere customers since 1977. I'm looking forward to the box office of Solo and SW9 :-)))Now aspiring film students write that TLJ would be a great movie. That means for me, the bad story writing in hollywood goes on :-( The force goes out ....In the past, 4-5 star reviewers wrote - what a great movie.Now you write - what a great movie with problems :-))Disney, please make the movie again based on TFA. You can kill the old heroes - but please with DIGNITY !!! You can take women and actors in the main roles of all countries - but with a good story, development and why they do something !!!Is that too much ?Hey you paid professional critics, that was probably bad, did you really believe that we are stupid? A few colorful pictures and cute animals and the story we do not care? HaHaHa you are no credible critic anymore :-) Find a new job, we will not look at you anymore if we want to know something about a movie. Disney paid you and then exposed you, bad luckLook at one, TFA after 2 years 842 pages reviews 88% audience reviews, TLJ after 3 months 2120 pages at 48% (with correct count of zero and half stars about 25%), something is wrong with the MOVIE :-) ))Here two 5 star reviews behind each other, one with name one without name, please do not say that's coincidence!!!joao vMarch 3, 2018(2∫C) star wars is a very good movie, has a good interpretation and has incredible historyMarch 3, 2018(2¬∫C) star wars is very good movie, has a good interpretation and has incredible story.Disney paid 5 stars one-liners, and now they are almost the same, the writers will not remember anything about this Star Wars Horror Movie :-)Critics who are looking forward to part 9, you can choose the chairs in the cinema, you will have plenty of space :-))Some 5 star reviewers write, the film has implemented 1.3 billion, he must be good?1: If we had known beforehand what would have happened, the movie would not have made a billion.2: TFA made over 2 billion, small difference - right? TLJ can not do that anymore.3: Now that we know what's coming of bad writing - solo / SW9 certainly not that high, except for Ron Howard / JJ making extraordinary movies with a wonderful story, such as Rogue One, that's saying now.Let's see Disney have bet on the right horse. The only thing that matters is - Money - let's see who has more, your new audience or us - Premiere Star Wars 1977 - Fans who do not want to see Star Wars 9 :-)Of course TFA is based on ANH and TLJ on TESB / ROTJ. Yoda was a lonely recluse / Luke is a lonely recluse. The hero travels to master Rey / Luke - Luke / Yoda, his friends fight elsewhere Saltplanet / Endor. The hero must cancel the teaching mission to save his friends. Hollywood and the studios have been making bad story writing for years - look to the remakes / prequels and more. A handful of films are good, over 80% not! We have noticed this here in Germany for 15 years, you in filmmaker country not?I just wanted to tell a good story, whether the main role of a woman or an actor from any country, I do not care. I have not written a review on Star Wars since 1977. But now it had to be, TLJ has great pictures, but nothing else ...So, there is much else, but I do not feel like it anymore ....This - new way - of Star Wars will NOT be mine ....Disney = no more money from me !!! I know Disney, that hurts you the most :-))This is not my Luke, Han shot first and only, Chewbacca eats porgs, Jedi needs training more than 10 minutes... and and and....Greetings from Germany, may the force be with us - except the makers of this film...",The Last Jedi,627

negative,"  Absolute trash city. the title of the movie should be called ""Star wars: trash city"". apparently the entire history of the canon means absolutely nothing now, and Disney has decided to ad lib the entire thing. First of all, apparently Leia is now sorceress. After three movies (four if you count her as a baby in Ep. III), several books, and many comics leia has shown zero force sensitivity, let alone the ability to survive long exposure to the vacuum of space before flyng to the safety of a distant air-lock. I mean come on! Leia literally is flyng through f****** space for the love of God. Luke turned from the hopeful hero in the original series to lazy, pussified, whiny man who draws his lightsaber on his nephew (ready to strike) without a work because I believes that Kylo Ren may be too far gone to the dark side. This is the same guy who literally, literally had his hand cut off by his estranged father and refused to kill him when he was in a fit of rage (Ep. 3). now you expect me believe this Bulls*** from Disney that he, while calm and collected, was ready to kill his nephew (whom he loved) on a whim? Once again Disney, wtf is going on? The question I really want to ask is how many blow jobs Disney had to dish out to the critics so that they would give their movie a 91%. Additionally, I think that rey is dope af. she is the baddest b**** ini all of star wars (in my opinion). But what this about having zero training and being able to lift 10 metric tons of boulders out of the way for her and her pals? I know what you're thinking; ""but wait! in this movie she trained with Luke, a jedi master"". you would correct. But to put this into context, Anakin trained from a young boy up until he turned on the jedi council to be able to do similar feats with the force. If you think that it's accurate to have rey doing that s*** after a couple days of breathing exercises you need a psychological evaluation. Another point! in ep. III yoda (I think we can all agree that he is a powerful jedi) was spinning those weird disks and throwing them at palpatine with difficulty. I'm not buying this Bs. And yoda in this movie? name any! any! literally any point throughout star wars that a force ghost physically interacted with their surrounding in the way that yoda does in this movie. yeah. you can't. If yoda can light s*** on fire why didn't he just go kill snoke himself or at least help his homies out at the end battle of this movie. Now lets talk about snoke. a sith lord so powerful that he can take someone as strong as rey and literally over power her with one hand while delivering his evil monologue. Which I would have accepted had they given even a glimpse of his abilities or his origin. Darth sideous is lucky af that snoke was just lurking in the background while he was ruling, because snoke who have made him his little b**** boy. And what is wrong with the social justice warrior bs that decided to throw in with rose? ""now it was worth it"". Excuse me, what? everyone you know and love is about to be murdered by the first order and you're taking your time to smash a casino and then take even more time to free some horse-like animal. wow. Disney is preying on people taken up by the left-wing political ideas and those are nostalgic for some old school star wars details.

negative,"  Abysmal. This movie is what happens if you have a director that hates all the elements that made Star Wars great (campy heroism, good storytelling, and consistent set of themes to name a few). This is like an 2.5 hour commercial for PETA to the point where I have to know if they actually paid the director. Also really glad they brought in a nihilist codebreaker into the same movie that looks like it was designed to sell stuffed animals to kids to talk about the nuances of arms dealing. Thank you for ruining Poe's character by the way. This movie isn't just bad. It's Rian Johnson giving the middle finger to Lucas in not so subtle ways. Oh you were excited to figure out what the story is with the Jedi sacred texts? Fuck you lol let's have Yodi appear and light them all on fire and say they were boring. Like that's actually what he says. Oh you wanted to see how wise Luke has become and what plot he has cooked up and what he's been doing. Well the most powerful Jedi in the universe tried to kill his disciple for having bad thoughts and now fishes and drinks space cow milk. And oh you wanted to see how Snoke would be as a real villain (seeing how Rey has already beaten Kylo) ?

Storyline: I felt the storyline really became stuck in places and there was a lot of lazy writing. Another aspect of the film that really let down the brilliant approach of Alicia VikanderPacing: Due to the failures of the storyline the pacing of the film was all over the place. At moments it felt like not much was happening and then things were happening too quickly. Genre: For an action film I didn't really feel like there was a lot of action and what there was could have been done better. Enjoyment: The film was ok. I really enjoyed the last 15-20 minutes of the film and found myself wondering why the rest of the film couldn't have been as good.

Story feels rushed with many plot-holes and continuity problems from TFA.It looks and sounds like a Star wars movie with its cutting edge visuals, amazing sound-fx and gorgeous music score by John Williams. But it feels empty, with no character development, it lacks any kind of emotional content. I couldn't care less about any of the new characters now, which is a shame because they had so much potential after TFA.I loved both TFA and Rogue-one, but I just cannot accept TLJ. It feels like a cheap generic sci-fi movie in a flashy Star wars wrapper. I sincerely hope the Star wars brand can recover, but the last jedi was a big let down for me and left me very unhappy and disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie.",The Last Jedi,637
negative,"  After a solid introduction in Civil War the Black Panther is unleashed into the MCU with ferocity in the characters first stand alone movie. After losing his father through assassination , T'Challa must now take his place as king of Wakanda as well as its sworn protector.The fictional land of Wakanda has hidden itself away from the outside world. Fueled by an alien substance called vibranium, it has achieved technological superiority, and an independence from all outside influences. Thorough a quick history lesson from father to son we learn how vibranium came to Wakanda, and how tribal warfare eventually led to unity in the land. Although the tribal warfare never truly ended fully. We also learn of the source of the Black Panthers power, which I personally was a bit disappointed with. Chadwick Boseman reprises the role of T'Challa/Black Panther along with Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis who return as CIA agent Ross and the villainous arms dealer Ulysses Klaue respectively. New to the cast are Angela Bassett as the queen mother Ramonda, Forest Whitaker as master of ceremony Zuri ,Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia the love interest, Danai Gurira as general Okoye and Letitia Wright as princess Shuri. Also new to the cast is Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger. After the events of Captain America: Civil War, King T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country's new leader. However, T'Challa soon finds that he is challenged for the throne from factions within his own country. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war. For the most part Black Panther is a solid first entry into the MCU. One of the better ones for sure, which again owes much to the characters strong introduction in Captain America 3. But the run-time is a bit too long and at times it gets bogged down in dialog heavy scenes which slows the pace of the film. Boseman plays the part of T'Challa as a bit stoic really, almost on the verge of being dull. That does kind of fit well with his situation though, having just lost his father and all. He comes more out of his shell in the scenes between him and his sister Shuri which are a joy to watch. Shuri also being a tech wiz who builds and updates all the Panther tech, Im sure a scene between her and one Tony Stark would be a scene stealer in any film. Martin Freeman gets a lot more screen time than I would have thought going into it, but he does a good job of representing the outsider thrust into this new world. Bassett and Whitaker do a fine job in their respective roles, but they have little to work with really. Whitaker get a little more to do which actually is connected to the plot. Michael B Jordan is great as the menacing Erik Killmonger, who although at least partially justified in his villainous actions has quite a radically different idea on how Wakanda should use its technology and advancements as it relates to the outside world. I could watch an entire film just about Killmonger.The look and feel of the film are quite good, although we never really get to see much of Wakanda¥s inner workings. What it is they do. And it's just plain weird to see these towering skyscrapers in one scene and a straw hut in another. The music was at times offputting also. I know they went for tribal african sounds, and music , but in a high speed chase in Korea it just did not fit well in my opinion. They also commit some cardinal mistakes which always drags the overall score down for me, but going into it would mean heavy spoilers and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone. Some things during its climax went way overboard to where I was just thinking ""really, why did they do that nonsense"" . I¬¥ll just say DinoRiders and let you figure it out.I was glad I saw it in glorious 2D as much of the fight scenes involving the Panther was set in dark surroundings, and moving at a very fast pace. It was hard enough keeping up with it without the added darkness of 3D glasses. The 3D is done after the fact anyway, so like always I say steer clear of the 3D version. All that said, some of the CGI was utter rubbish. Especially the final fight scene.I was pretty happy with the film overall, and I am excited to see and learn more about the characters and the land of Wakanda. There is still some secrets left there , and Im guessing we shall find out more in the upcoming Avengers Infinity War where Wakanda features heavily. I wonder why ( not really )",Black Panther,2317
negative,"  After all the hype everywhere, and a 100% rating on RT, I was expecting something truly epic, with a side dish of liberal BS as seems to be the case everywhere these days. What I got instead was a typical, completely predictable Marvel Trope. Honestly, not as much liberal BS as I was expecting. The movie kinda delves into the origins of Black Panthers, why they wanted their fictional country of Wakanda ot stay hidden, and fair enough, the motivations of both sides are understandable, and you can empathize with both sides. Where the movie fails completely is execution. There is only maybe 10-15 minutes of decent action, and maybe another 15 mins of completely ridiculous ""Godzilla"" style fights where the viewer is not emotionally invested at all. *spoiler alert* Both antagonists and protagonists wear a pretty much indestructible suit, and proceed to punch the crap out of each other, but in the end, everyone knows nothing will happen to the good guy. Pluses: The sister of the king is fairly enjoyable to watch, she has some decent one liners, some jokes:""What are THOOOSE?!"" fall a bit flat, but maybe that's just because of the current meme culture, where something is extremely funny for a week, and then immediately dated and old. The inevitable political BS: Honestly, not as much as I expected. Sure, 95% of characters are black. Well, sure, it's a movie set in Africa, what did you expect? But as far as pushing any kind of propaganda, I didn't see almost any of it. They just wanted to make a movie about Black Panther, they just didn't make it all that interesting.

negative,"  After reading Ernest Cline's novel, I felt ""Ready Player One"" could make a good movie. Yes, I know that there would be considerable changes from the source material as is commonplace, but I was optimistic the movie could work. My optimism was misplaced. This movie is not terrible, but I just found it dull despite all the scenes that are built on adrenaline and supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat. This story seemed all too familiar. Again we get the David vs. Goliath story and David won in the end (Yawn.). The changes here from the novel don't work. One thing I will say in the movie's favor is that it tries to keep the basic theme of Ernest Cline's novel that as fun as fantasy is, reality is better mainly because it is real and that obsession is actually a bad thing that can lead to tragedy. Two of Spielberg's last three films have been duds. Let's hope he gets out of this rut soon.",Ready Player One,1889

I had already read the book so we were both EXCITED to see the movie. We took my 20 year old that did not read the book with us.This movie was so far from the book that my son and I wanted to walk out 1/2 way through the movie! My 20 year said it had nice graphics but was an ""Okay"" movie. We sat through this horrible adaptation ONLY because I paid a TON of money to see it at the theater on opening weekend. And opening weekend in Oklahoma city, as anyone who read the book knows, lead to long lines.HE MUTILATED THE BOOK! took names of characters and the basic theme of the movie to make a Hodge-Podge pile of dung. To MUCH CGI to really develop any characters, skipped over too much of the story lines and adversities that the characters faced, changed all but the final challenge. Overall, it was a mess!At the end of the movie, there were a few teens that clapped but even then the muttering and grumbling in the theater silenced the claps quickly. As we walked out alongside others who could not leave fast enough, I heard the same thing. It was AWFUL!Seriously, don't make the same mistake that we did... Wait til it comes out on Netflix, Amazon Prime, or better yet, Pirate Bay! Not worth the money or time. I wouldn't even get it from Red-box!I cannot believe that Cline would sign off on such a huge detour from the book.

I thought the acting was decent. but it just did not resonate with me, at all.At least Black Panther made a $1B globally, which will help Disney soften the blow from this disaster movie. Hurricane Heist is probably better, or for a sure bet try watching Thoroughbred.",A Wrinkle in Time,3544
negative,"  All I can say is, meh. I thought Marvel was finally moving away from these boring, almost robotic movies after the ludicrously entertaining and refreshing Thor: Ragnarok and Spiderman Homecoming, but then this movie came out. This could just as easily have been spit out by a machine and there is barely any personality to it because God forbid Marvel say something potentially offensive about a minority. To me, the critical acclaim for this movie is just disheartening and very similar to that of Wonder Woman last year. Message to all critics: just because there are minorities or 'oppressed' people in a movie, does not make it good. I'm sorry to get political, but I can't help but feel that that is the way that this movie has been judged by people thus far, so I needed to get it out of the way. Moving on...In terms of the script, characters, and film-making, this movie is just average. The characters aren't very well developed (what is Daniel Kaluuya's motivation), the villain - for all the critical acclaim he got - wasn't particularly good or well-developed, even though Michael B. Jordan was good in the role, and there are moments where you just ask yourself, ""Why should I care about this?"" I mean, it's not like Marvel could expect you to believe that the main character might die - he's in the fucking Infinity War trailer, for crying out loud! - or that any harm could come to anyone in the panther suit - they repeatedly explained that it was indestructible! I guess I'm just rambling at this point, but I don't feel that there is a coherent way to speak about the messy sludge that is this movie. Overall, the Marvel movie it most reminds me of is Age of Ultron - sure, it may have the $200 million budget to have decent special effects, but that doesn't mean that the movie is engaging or has any heart. To be perfectly honest I was bored at several points during the movie, and if I had had a watch I would certainly have checked it regularly. The whole point of Marvel movies is that they're meant to be enteratining, and this just wasn't to me. I know there are people out there who really connected to or at least enjoyed this movie, and you know what? Good for you. But I personally didn't enjoy this movie, and most certainly do not believe that 97% of critics did.",Black Panther,2037
negative,"  all myths are foundations of reality..Tomb RaiderEven though there are stunning graphic visuals (all the water based sequences are beautifully shot), goosefleshing sound effects, brutal action sequences and jaw dropping stunts (hats off to the stuntmen) ironically the choreography; in a feature like this that relies a lot upon such stuff, is petty and questionable which at a certain point turns depressing rather than frustrating. At this stage of cinema, one would assume that the remake or the updated version of any feature or tale would be created with an aim to surpass the predecessor and fulfill the limitations (one is wrong). The premise never had enough potential to bedazzle the audience in the first place but in here the director Roar Uthaug is not even convincing the audience for a second look. Alicia Vikander, at the heart of it is so good and genuine throughout the course of it that it aches you to watch a talent go waste by.

negative,"  Alright, persons of variable gender identities, gather around! Grandpa D has another movie review and this time, I added sizzling passion to my words! On the chopping block is Annihilation (2018), the latest directorial effort from Alex Garland. This will be a spoiler-free review (as usual) and I'll be sourcing any plot material that was revealed from the already-released movie trailers. Now then, this is a feature with a lot of promise, given that Alex Garland delivered an amazing Deus Ex Machina for science fiction fare. The promise is of a movie that would deliver an alternative perspective from an all-female crew caught in a paradox: the world they enter is known to them and yet, it bears qualities that disrupt their personal grasps on reality, both physical and metaphysical. I was looking forward to this cast (helmed by a solid performance from Natalie Portman) and that excitement grew by the first half of the movie. I was expecting a psychological case study into how this crew will adapt and survive in this altogether foreign environment. As soon as introductions are finished, we learned that these characters were not superwomen but instead, (initially) written to be fractured souls looking for some form of redemption. It felt like a breath of fresh air to see these characters beginning to struggle with their physical inabilities in a genre riddled with incredibly-adept characters. I was expecting to be witness to the resourcefulness, cooperation, and intelligence of this crew of five, instead of the tried-and-true displays of muscle and brawn we've grown accustomed to. Unfortunately for my expectations, I bore witness to a rather unremarkable feature that readily devolved these characters into victims of survival-horror tropes.Once the second creature interaction occurs, it becomes plainly obvious that Mr. Garland will not deliver us the promises of fully-realized characters. After this creature interaction, the movie becomes as uninspired and stale as the creature designs themselves. My friend and I had quite a laugh at how poor the CGI seemed at times when we have been subject to remarkable CGI fare in the past. The ""big reveal"" and ending was even more disappointing in how uninspired the whole affair seemed. I had a suspicion that this movie was written to be too self-conscious: in a grand display of irony, the core theme of this movie (change by mutation) served to describe its chief pitfall. This screenplay is a mutated amalgamation from previous fare, such as Contact (1997 with Jodie Foster); Solaris (novel); creature design from Resident Evil; and The Astronaut's Wife (1997 with Charlize Theron). I am certain that if you've been exposed to the aforementioned material, you should have a good idea of how this movie will play out and the ending bore little-to-no surprise at all. Honestly, I would avoid it altogether. Save yourself the hassle and wait until it becomes free on Netflix.I give this uninspired turkey dinner 1.5 Wub-Wubs/5. I would tell you why the wub-wub, but then it might ruin the ""surprise"" for you. I just hope that Alex Garland does not become the next Neill Blomkamp.",Annihilation,4707

Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny were way short of convincing. I truly wish the ""genetically augmented bear"" made it's debut sooner and more frequent throughout this film, as this computer generated entity was the only thing that was remotely entertaining /convincing and did a great job of removing some of the less convincing characters from the story .. The story line was somewhat thought provoking from a scientific perspective, however, it gave little back in the form of intelligent narrative, so in my mind this story told through the lens of Alex Garland was mostly pathetic and nonsensical.

negative,"  Another one of those what ifs that could have been so much better with a more experienced director. One of the problems with Garland is that he's idolised as a voice of a generation and so carries a weight of expectation on anything he puts his hand to, along with that there's more a hint of fawning obsequiousness from British reviewers.Ex Machina was relatively tight, set in a confined space with few characters, it did pose some good questions on AI, humanity, and ego, before setting them aside to focus on manipulation and thrills.Annihilation is broader in scope but less interesting, less well structured, and somewhat confused about what it wants to be - tonally it shifts all over the place.It begins with a meteorite hitting earth. It carries a life form that replicates and mutates across species, as well as between plant and animal. Its effects are spreading outwards from the point of impact at an increasing rate, and the edge of its area of influence can be seen as a shimmer. Teams of people have gone into the 'shimmer', but none have ever come out.The one man does, except there's something wrong with him and he's dying. His wife joins up with a team going into the Shimmer in order to get to the source in the hopes that she'll find something that will help.This is all standard fare for Science Fiction - it's kind of The Andromeda Strain meets War of the Worlds meets Contact meets Alien; the basic set up could be told in minutes, but it takes forfuckingever to get its arse in gear. That's a big part of the problem, the film can't decide what tone to take - it starts off as a drama, then tries to switch up gears to being an adventure into the unknown before switching gears again to being a bit more psychological before shifting over to horror and then into some trippy half-bakery.It just doesn't gel as a whole story, it's more a collection of influences strung together in a manner that's less than the sum of its parts.Natalie Portman does well with a character who has to be strong enough to survive but who seems too often to be asked to play her part as over-wrought. She's fearless bringing down sharkgator, but that moment is the only one where she seems in command of herself.Jennifer Jason Leigh rasps her way through things with scene stealing disinterest, which is at least notable. Everyone else is cardboard thin so that by the time they start disappearing one by one, as people in these things are wont to do, it's impossible to care either way.Aside from Sharkgator there's a Cowbear auditioning for a sequel to the Revenant but it fails because it makes a 13yo boy laugh. There's another faux Alien bit that's supposedly gory, but again the boy sees the fakery a mile off and is duly unimpressed. If any of these three scenes were supposed to be thrilling they utterly failed, there's not an iota of tension to the hohumness of the endeavour.This isn't so much a deliberately slow-paced film as a low energy one consumed by indecision.",Annihilation,4090

negative,"  Another victim of the ""Video Game Movie"" curse. I knew this was gonna be a terrible reboot as soon as I saw the trailer but boy, was I in for a treat.First of all, it boggles my mind as onto how this movie got financed with 94 Million Dollars and got handed to people with barely any experience. Thankfully it's flopping at the box office so we won't see a sequel but whoever is using this project as means of money laundering still got their cash back. Tomb Raider made a pathetic 28Mil domestic and a total of 133Mil worldwide as of this moment.Now let's move onto the movie itself. The writers and creators of this project had dozens of ""Tomb Raider"" games to seek inspiration from as well as millions of myths and legends from all around the globe, they picked the weakest concept to be converted into a movie. They chose the 2013 Tomb Raider relaunch of the game series, which focuses on a young Lara Croft going out into the world for the first time and becoming the legend that she is. NOBODY want's to see this as a movie, (I'm assuming) most of us who saw the movie are familiar with the game lore to at least a minimal extent. The developers of the game had to start fresh and make a new Lara without outrage, this movie didn't have to worry about that. Audiences wanted two hours of an epic action-adventure set in exotic locales, following the story of the most badass female hero in the world. Instead, we got to sit through an excruciating and cringy two-hour drama about a whiny, entitled, dumb ""teenager"" who is repeatedly humiliated at every single task that she attempts on her quest to find and save her daddy. It's not ""relatable"", it's just bad and sad. Personally, the casting of Alicia Vikander was the first disappointment while the movie was still in production. Why not use Camilla Luddington who the new Lara Croft is based on, played by and voiced by? Why go for a C-List actress in hopes of a higher box-office? Those choices are beyond me. Alicia's Lara reminds me of Kristen Stewart's performance of Bella in the ""Twilight"" series - lifeless, bland and annoying. Perhaps, it's just the horrendous writing and she's a good actress, I honestly can't tell, however I know for a fact there is lots of wasted potential in this movie. Take Walton Goggins for example, fantastic performance in The Hateful Eight, sub-par performance in Tomb Raider, however, I don't think the script gave the actors much to work with, no room to act or express themselves/their characters in this adaptation.Literally, everything about the writing in this movie is depressingly bad, characters often speak their motivations, emotions and plot exposition through the blandest, most boring, unnatural dialogue you can possibly imagine. This movie feels like it was written by somebody who's never written a movie before. Oh wait, Geneva Robertson-Dworet who wrote this movie has never worked on a single other movie before. Shocking, I know! You know what's more shocking? She's set to write Marvel's first female-led superhero film ""Captain Marvel"", as well as ""Sherlock Holmes 3"" and the upcoming live-action adaptation of ""Dungeons & Dragons"". I pray to the studio executives and the ""big mouse"" that they take those movies away from her because they will be a train-wreck otherwise. The other contributing writer of this movie, Alastair Siddons is almost equally inexperienced with 1 movie behind their belt (which sits at a 27% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes).If you've ever though some movie checks off every single cliche and trope of its genre, whatever movie you have in mind has a new competitor. Tomb Raider is one of the most painfully predictable movies to a point of hilarity. Literally, I was laughing my entire way through this film because it follows it's own formula beat by beat leaving nothing behind. I would honestly say it's as bad but also equally entertaining as ""Suicide Squad"". To be fair, I would assume that most average moviegoers who are programmed to enjoy their mindless entertainment made by a formula won't even notice anything off and shrug it off as a ""decent"" movie. However, if you have any amount self-respect and prior knowledge of films, I think it's safe to say this will be a great new addition to your ""so bad it's good"" collection of movies.Moving on from that, the action is honestly as boring and predictable as the writing, with some of the best scenes being lifted directly, frame-by-frame from the 2013 video-game. The fighting choreography is equally ""meh"". The cinematography is also not this movies strong suit, nor are the special effects or acting or production design or anything really. In fact, the movie consists of maybe about 15 minutes of tomb raiding, meaning if you cut this movie down by about an hour and a half, it would make a perfect short film. Also, most importantly, even though nobody wants to see an origin story, that being the crucial part of this movie and it's plot, I'm afraid to say it fails on that promise and there is absolutely no character development at all. Maybe with the exception of cheesy lines such as ""You messed with the wrong Croft"" and ""I guess I'm not that kind of Croft"" and Croft this and Croft that and ""I'll take two guns please"". Get it? It's a reference for nerds like you! This movie beats it's gaming audience in the head with pointless Easter eggs and makes sure to point them out and scream about it as if we're all dumb babies.My conclusion is that even ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was significantly better and had its moments unlike the 2018 adaptation of ""Tomb Raider"". So, if you like learning from ""bad Hollywood"" or just want to have mindless fun or maybe need to fall asleep on a flight, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise, be it the games or the movie franchise starring Angelina Jolie, you'll be severely disappointed. If you're a fan of the action-adventure genre and want a thrilling escape from reality, desperately trying to scratch that itch, wanting to feel the way you did when you watched movies like ""Indiana Jones"", ""The Mummy"" (original trilogy), ""National Treasure"" or even ""Sahara"" then once again, prepare for disappointment.",Tomb Raider,9717

negative,"  Anyone else notice how every positive review of TLJ is some vague, boring-ass variation of ""it was bold! It was different!"" that manages to avoid any meaningful justification - whereas the legion negative reviews are scathingly precise, passionately written and chock-filled with specific examples of why the movie sucked. We all know the truth - TLJ was a confused, poorly executed film that was more concerned with potty jokes and lazy ""gotcha!"" plot beats than actual storytelling. Any critic worth their salt knows this too, but they can't say anything for fear of going against the prevailing social justice groupthink of hollywood. Critics are facing a major credibility crisis (as is Rotten Tomatoes). More of them are becoming bought-and-paid-for corporate shills scared to ""toe the party line"". They prize ideology over art (storytelling) and that's a VERY dangerous place to be. Hope they're prepared to be not taken seriously anymore. Lastly, I'll say I have ZERO problem with socially progressive themes in sci fi - after all, that's always been a hallmark of the genre - however Rian Johnson presents his social justice themes with all the subtlety and nuance of a fifth grader (disposable C-plot with a black and female asian, disproportionate number of strong female characters, weak or buffoonish male characters needing the guidance of said females). Come on Rian! These feel so obvious and forced that they insult your audience's intellect - and ultimately serve to distract, not enhance, your story.",The Last Jedi,532

negative,"  Anything that had to do with the journey of a warrior-king was well done, but it was sullied anytime it got too contemporary or inserted cringey jokes. I'd actually really love to see what Coogler could do with a straight fantasy story.For an MCU movie in 2018, the CG was way too inconsistent, and when it was bad it was real bad. The general design of Wakanda was great and the costumes design was good, but Wakanda did not feel like a living breathing place. It felt like maybe a couple hundred people lived there, most of which were the nobility and the warrior castes. They really missed an opportunity to convey to us in some way what life was like for the average Wakandan.Overall, overhyped and overrated basic entry into the MCU. They should have played up the fantasy and put more effort into world-building and CG quality.",Black Panther,2303

negative,"  As a Catholic, I am a bit ashamed that I do not know enough about St. Paul and the Acts of the Apostle enough to review the movie based upon the original source material--the New Testament itself! However, I can access it based on its merit as a film, and it is, I think for the faithful Christian, recommended viewing.First, I merit the film based on the recent turgid, Hollywood, non-faithful/ ignorant-of-the-faith recent films with faith-based themes, like Ben Hur, Moses, Samson, and Noah--all made by major Hollywood studios and with well-known directors behind them. That they focused solely on mere spectacle divorced from its underlying and most important message of faith is astonishing. Maybe I can say that they all floundered in the box office precisely because of its agnostic message (if there was any) divorced from faith but I think that would be acceding to ignorance. They were just poorly made films, I think, and, divorced from its faith-message, no reason for the true devout Christian to see them.Any faithful believer and adherent of Christianity would recognize that rare movie made by well-intended, well-informed Christian. This film is one of them. (Not to keen on who the director of this film is, nor its writer, the faith message in this film is clearly felt if not clearly intended).So take heart Christians and heed-not the poor reviews that appear from non-Christians for, being ignorant of the faith, they cannot access what's truly important in this film, which is Saul's last attempt at the Good News during the last year of his persecution. It may not be wholly faithful to the Acts of the Apostle but I think God would forgive that and bless its good intentions nonetheless. Recommend viewing for the Christian and the overall general public.I give it two and a half stars for its merit strictly as a film and merits as a film medium including its production values, but to be true, I give it three stars for its success as a faith-based film, which I think merits a separate rating.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7689
negative,"  As a catholic, there are no problems or issues with the story elements and plot details since it was based on the story of the Bible but how it flaws is the depicting and storytelling of the story and also the inaccurate script and writing of the characters.

Hoping to see my childhood hero Luke Skywalker again. I am beyond disappointed. The story was terrible the character development was all wrong. I am sorry but this does not feel like a star wars movie. Sad what Disney have done to it.",The Last Jedi,394
negative,"  As a fan growing up watching the original trilogy I was so disappointed with The Last Jedi. The film rips up every plot line from The Force Awakens and totally destroys the character of Luke Skywalker!An amazing achievement. Looks like they are writing stories for a different audience now, congratulations Disney, I'm out!",The Last Jedi,267
negative,  As a fan of Veep I did not find this movie very funny at all. No one in our theater was laughing much at all.,The Death of Stalin,8224
negative,"  As a huge Star Wars fan I left the Cinema after watching this feeling really disappointed. The last Jedi basically threw out every story arc created by JJ Abrams in the force awakens. Who Reys parents are, Snoke, Knights of wren all thrown in the bin for whatever reason. It was all an up yours to JJ Abrams and his story from Force Awakens, making that film pointless. Every turn this movie took I felt was a let down, trying to be different for different sake.The humour I found to be off, the film basically starts with a prank call ending in a Your Mother joke!The story is the slowest space chase in history where some random resistance leader appears instead of say Ackbar and takes over as leader while a main character is out of action, but instead of letting anyone know what her plan is, keeps it a secret for whatever reason. Making Poe the resistance hero look like a moron the whole movie as he questions what's going on, thinking a traitor is aboard.Finn was off on a pointless side quest with a new character where we can learn that animal cruelty is wrong, rich people are bad, oh and so is child slavery if you didn't know. Ending in a terrible escaping on back of animals cgi laden scene.Rey doesn't get taught anything from Luke which was such a let down. Luke was wasted badly in this film, this was not Luke we all knew from the original trilogy. Of course he would change over the years but not become what Rian Johnson created.The ending for the middle of a trilogy was bizzarre, focused on a random kid staring into the stars insinuating a new hope is born rather than focusing on the heroes of the story. It deffinately didn't have me excited about what is going to happen next in episode 9.Effects were good as you would expect and I found everyone acted well with what they had to work with. I would class this as the worst Star Wars movie so far. Because Im weak I will probably buy this on Blu Ray at some point because I'm a Star Wars nut, but I wont pre-order like I did say Rogue One which was a great Star Wars story. My negativity is coming from someone who read all the EU books before they were just legend, so my thoughts on how great the continued story could be were high, with Force Awakens not dissapointing. Unfortunately my expectations for future Star Wars has really nose dived.Rian Jonson really blew it with this one, Im not sure how JJ Abrams can pull this back for episode 9 unless he retcons multiple things from this movies story some how.",The Last Jedi,824
negative,"  As a lifelong star wars fan, this movie is an abomination, RIP STAR WARS.",The Last Jedi,175
negative,"  As a movie critic, my chief responsibility is to tell you whether a given release is worth your time and money. While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie.",Black Panther,2524
negative,"  As a moviegoer, I am not hard please. However, I haaaaated this movie, as did my mom, brother, and husband who were with me. It was incredibly boring, and the story made little sense.

negative,"  As an avid star wars fan, I've been waiting 2 years for this sequel to finally happen and after leaving the theater, I was a little bit disappointed in what the end result we got with this long awaited sequel. J.J. Abrams set up that cliffhanger at the end of The Force Awakens only for Rian Johnson to take it and throw it off the cliff (literally!). every scene on the island was terrible and now ""force skype"" suddenly exists between rey and kylo ren supposedly. however they did add a new interesting new ability about the force where you can hologram yourself from thousands of lightyears away however using it too much can kill you. I hate how they handled the characters in this film and the film itself didn't quite have the same tone as it did with the force awakens except for the first scene on the island playing the music from the previous film during the scene. the humour was abit off especially how they kept using general hux as a punching bag in almost every scene he is in. I thought the whole Canto Bight Casino scene was pointless and too long. Out off all the time they had to exclude that whole scene, they could've answered the questions that us (the audience) had when we left the theaters from The Force Awakens such as who are rey's parents? who is snoke and where did he come from? (which by the way don't get your hopes up because he gets killed off with no story and his death leads to probably one of the best most unlikely lightsaber partnership duel massacres in the entire franchise only when you think kylo ren has finally reached the light, he decides hes bad again after literally helping a foe fight off his own side. Plus there were moments that. And Luke Skywalker was not the Luke a Skywalker I remembered from the Original Trilogy. He was grouchy and every scene he felt obligated and forced (no pun intended) to be in the film. I found the Rose character to be extremely annoying and she would not leave finn alone and give him space to breathe ever in this film. I understand this movie is meant mostly to kids but even films like this can appeal to adults (especially adults who grew up during the original trilogy). I don't hate the film because of the direction they were trying to go (I did like how they were trying to do something different and i'll give them props for that) I just hate how this film was poorly thought out and written. even mark Hamill said that he hated and disagreed with what rian Johnson did with his character. especially how considering in the original trilogy how despite how evil darth vader was, he knew and saw a little bit of good still left in him. however in this film he senses the dark side in kylo ren (who was ben solo at the time of this scene) and he tries to murder him in his sleep. that's not luke skywalker. anyway since jj abrams is back in the director's seat for episode ix, I hope he corrects all the mistakes that rian Johnson made with this film and redeem this franchise before it gets any worse. anyway I hope they learn from this film and move forward. I haven't lost all faith in star wars (yet). I cant wait to see what episode ix has in store in 2019 to conclude the trilogy",The Last Jedi,568
negative,"  As big long time sifi fan, IMHO this flick is awful, simply awful. No character development. I could not have cared less about the fate of these opaque characters. Story line riddled with numerous holes, absurdities and inconsistencies. The moldy sponge ball alien was laughable. A boring pointless sex scene that the director was so proud of that he used it not once but twice during the movie.

At best, this decision is poor marketing; ignoring the fan base that made Star Wars as popular and iconic as it is, and at best, it's a spiked-bat being used to bludgeon politically-correct ideology down the throats of a public, unwilling to spend upwards of $100/family for the privilege of being preached to for 2.5 hours.

Star Wars operates on the level of archetype, it's why it has such a broad cultural appeal, it's why the characters are beloved and celebrated. It's about the hero's journey, the noble sacrifice, good vs evil.The writing and direction utterly failed in this movie. Disney, and particularly JJ and Rian, lack the creative vision to do Star Wars, they're just milking it for money at this point.This movie is downright offensive to the Star Wars universe.

I remember leaving feeling empty, kind of in shock and tried to justify it, after the second viewing I genuinely hate this movie. It's not just this movie but the direction Lucasfilm is going with Kennedy at the top, we need a SW fan running things not someone who is going to push a political agenda on everyone. Kennedy is incompetent look at all the directors she has fired for example.

negative,"  Being an enthusiastic fan of the Tomb Raider games, a movie that looked like it was pulled straight out of my favorite of the games had me nearly vibrating in anticipation. The trailers and teasers used scenes carefully chosen to mimic iconic 2013 Tomb Raider game moments, bursting with promises of an incredible live action debut of the fantastically written reboot of Lara Croft's story. The resulting movie, however, proved nothing more than a vast disappointment and a waste of two hours that would have served better in the game it was pretending to emulate.",Tomb Raider,10156

negative,  Best cinematic qualities of all Star Wars films. Story lines were weakest of any SW film. The character development was very weak and unconvincing. The actors and actresses were excellent but the chemistry between each was in my opinion worse than the original trilogy but much better than the prequels. This should have been a standalone movie and separate from any particular trilogy or saga. Did not have the feel of a Star Wars movie. Sad. Wasted the character of Luke.

negative,"  Black panther can be an interesting superhero, but in this movie he is a male Mary Sue charecter with an equally boring plot. The Action scenes were boring, and the protagonists felt like villains with the actual villain being the only interesting character in the movie. Other than that there were a few other things in the movie I disliked, like the race-baiting jokes like ""And who are you, the colonizer"" and the special effects being cartoony or unrealistic. Overall, this movie was a disappointment considering I wanted to see it, and ending up watching a boring and rushed movie",Black Panther,2376
negative,"  Black Panther is a deathly serious superhero movie that attempts light-hearted comedic moments and fails entirely. As far a marvel films go it is incredibly average in terms of action. Compared to other recent marvel movies, the social references we're out of control, especially with a what are those reference, and it falls flat comedically and breaks the serious tone the movie sets about delicate social issues. The movie tries very hard to add real world social issues into a fictional universe, somewhat succeeds but ultimately falls a little flat in terms of actual solutions to those problems (the social issues can play into the fictional world but the solutions can't come from the fictional world to the real one). Some positives, Jack Kirby was given credit for the character in the credits. The CGI to me almost looked dated and out of place for a marvel movie, especially in 2018, with some scenes reminding me of early 2000s animation. The music in the film was interesting, most if the kendric Lamar songs did not the moment it was used, but was there just to create links to our world in order to trick the viewer into making real world comparisons, which is interesting. Some of the accents in the film we're closer to fake African accents, seeing as most of the actors don't carry the African accent in their daily lives. Overall, Black Panther is an alright film that certainly did not deserve the praise it received from critics and is ultimately going to be remembered not as a cultural milestone, but the 20th or so movie before Infinity War. Not as exciting as Captain America Winter Soldier, but not as boring as Thor: Dark World as far as action goes. Overall okay film, very average but enjoyable for fans of superhero movies and the MCU.",Black Panther,2664

negative,  BLACK PANTHERwas good but not the be all its being made out to be.There was very little action and the messaging was very heavy handed and it also felt like the people who made this relied on a lot of African stereo types i.e the plate lip thing that was a practice that was started to put off the white slavers they didn't want unattractive slaves and in this wakanda has been isolated for millennia so why would this have been part of there culture because it sure made talking an issue lol the film was over long and they didn't film any of it in Africa wtf,Black Panther,2606

negative,"  Blotchy transition. The cast has no acting ability except the ones playing Lu Ren, the man coughing in the jungle, the Croft business partner/ friend, the workers and some of the fighters. Lara Croft's actress can't pull off the lines albeit the lines are often so basic, cheesy, and virtually cut-pasted. She's just not suited for the role though she tries. She did have some good action sequences. The father seemed to have potential but upon meeting him at the jungle that seemed lost. I know that Tomb Raider games and movies are so fantastical it's exciting, but there is always that element of "" Ok if I were there I would have done this...or this..."" It's fantasy that allows us to feel as though it could be true if only for 1.5 hours. But not here. The jungle vines seem fake. The temple door has such a perfect circular cut in the stone after it was bombed open?!? And it couldn't be open with the bombs? And the people are on an island for 7 years when all they had to do was what they did in the end.... ? No one thought of that? The smugglers were going in and out often bringing in equipment and bombs lol... The father is some intellectual but a Moses looking dude while everyone else is pretty neat and clean? The queen comes up in a random Halloween booby trap... THAT was supposed to be the wow factor....Some of the computer effects: the boat crash, the airplane, the end run scene where fine but again not believable. Also couldn't the father just have cut his arm off???",Tomb Raider,9524
negative,"  Blue Sky Animation is the home of the truly mediocre in modern animation. The house that the awful Ice Age movies built is back again and apparently attempting to hide their latest bit of sub-par animation by opening Ferdinand opposite Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Smart move, Blue Sky. Burying Ferdinand is definitely the right call. No, the movie isn't terrible, it's just mediocre. And in a world where Pixar still rules, it's not a bad idea to drop your more modestly ambitious products where few audiences will see it. https://geeks.media/movie-review-ferdinand?_ga=2.260866509.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710",Ferdinand,5976
negative,"  Blue Sky, we need to talk. So based on a children's book from the 1930s, this is about an oversized bull with a gentle heart, Ferdinand (John Cena). All he wants to do is smell the flowers and live with his family in Spain, but it seems that destiny is determined to pull him into the bull fighting life that he has tried so hard to get away from. Now if there is someone out there that can give this movie a fair chance, it's me. I love family oriented animation, and more often than not, I tend to connect with movies of this type to the point of defending them, sometimes undeservedly so. This got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature, but that's not saying much, as it is no secret that the Academy doesn't take animation seriously (see: The Boss Baby). So how does Ferdinand stack up? Well, I think kids will like it fine, but I can't say that there is really much here for adults. Now to this movie's credit, this actually starts off stronger than I expected. I did sincerely enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes of setup where we learn about Ferdinand's backstory and get introduced to the family that adopts him. It is rare that I can pinpoint when a movie ceases to work, but it is precisely when Kate McKinnon shows up as a comfort goat. I think she is a talented actress, but the only purpose she serves here is just to be the zany sidekick, and they don't have really much of anything written for her to do. It is just a lot of weak sight gags, and none of them really have any payoff. It then starts to become more generic for the following second act... and then something unexpected happens. I do not consider this to be a spoiler because it has absolutely nothing to do with the forward movement of the plot, but right around the hour mark, this turns into Bring It On with no warning or reason. I mean really, all of these bulls have a dance off against these three horses that inexplicably have German accents, and it ends up being highly surreal and out of place. I don't think Cena does badly with his voice acting, but I do think he still has a ways to go before he reaches the status that Dwayne Johnson is currently at. I liked Ferdinand as a character as well, as he is basically like a giant dog who doesn't know his own size, but all of the side characters got on my nerves as time went on. It's watchable, but it is just very DreamWorks, if you follow me. I would say show it to your kids, but then again, kids have no idea who this character is, so they probably won't be excited for this. If this didn't get lazy after the first act, I might have been able to give this a low recommendation, but as it stands, it ends up being a bit of a misfire.",Ferdinand,5836

negative,"  Cinematography, lighting, costumes all wonderful. But this film did not preform good in believable character development, continuing a story smoothly, holding true to established rules from the new cannon, answering any questions established prior, and giving the audience a real reason to care about any new characters. The story falls flat with M. Night Shyamalan style twists that do not make you believe them. It is obvious that the director wanted to flaunt artistic flair but this flair was shallow and skin deep. If you take this film as an infinities of Star Wars it might be ok but in cannon it is utter trash disregarding everything but it's self. Bringing you incredible landscapes and scenes only to destroy them in order to shock you with lazy writing or cop outs. Plot demands personality changes that are unnatural for characters well established. This film really does just throw away everything you care about worse than Game of Thrones. Though Game of Thrones actually has a cohesive story and arcs most of the time where the last Jedi fails to even do that. . I recommend this film to anyone who want to know if they should bother with Star Wars anymore. The Last Jedi will give you a very loud in your face reason to never touch our beloved Star Wars again.

negative,  Creature from the Black Lagoon with a big budget. Two hours of my life wasted. The best part of the experience was that ads before the feature. The movie's plot is as subtle as a brick. The bad guys all wear black hats. You have to completely suspend disbelief but for no good purpose. Hollywood has lost its mind. I can't imagine how this drivel garnered as many Academy Award nominations as it did.

negative,"  Death and taxes are not the only certainties in life, as Benjamin Franklin famously asserted. Another certainty is that video game movies are always bad, but that is not a lesson Hollywood has learned. If anything, they seem to be doubling down on video game movies by giving Tomb Raider yet another shot. The result is by no means the worst video game movie, but it's still a pretty bad one.The inescapable core problem of Tomb Raider is the same as every other video game movie: going from the interactive experience of a game to the passive one of a movie is inherently a step down. Sure, Tomb Raider features the same mechanisms, visual style, and sound effects in its puzzles and death defying stunts as the game. One scene in particular was ripped right out of the game. Watching Lara Croft pulling them off, however, is nowhere near as satisfying as doing them yourself. As is, the action is pedestrian, but compared to the game's combat, it's downright boring. That the movie intrigues me more with the fast-paced lives of London couriers than the actual tomb raiding is an early bad sign.If it's unfair to judge this film by video game standards, then allow me to inform you this movie isn't that much better from a pure film-making perspective, either. The lighting alone is atrocious, especially during night scenes. They are so poorly illuminated that they strained my eyes. Worst of all is the thunderstorm scene. The filmmakers' idea of simulating lightning is to rapidly flicker the lights on and off. This extremely uncomfortable technique drags on for so long, there should be a warning in case it triggers an epileptic seizure. At least the movie's unconventional camerawork manages to impress. Each shot rarely gets followed up by the logical next camera angle, while the 180 degree rule shrinks to more like the 120 degree rule. For a style that plays fast and loose with the rules of cinematography, it is quite a feat that the action remains visually coherent.Granted, video games are about much more than game-play, and this movie, based off of the 2013 reboot, has a story to tell. If Tomb Raider was an earnest attempt at adapting that story for a wider audience, it would probably be a much better movie. Instead, it ends up another attempt to kick-start a sequel, so the most interesting elements of the 2013 Tomb Raider's story are replaced with franchise tropes. The entire supporting cast is swapped for a pair of less interesting characters. To the movie's credit, each character is well-acted enough to distract from how two-dimensional they are. Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina) definitely looks the part for Lara Croft, and she brings the tough, quick-witted attitude Croft is known for, but her Croft lacks the character arc that made the game's story so good. She begins the movie close to mastering her talents, getting all but the bare minimum character development out of the way. It's hysterical that one of her nameless friends what appears to be a Mass Effect jacket, because the writers reduced an interesting journey of a sheltered college student thrust into becoming a hardened survivalist into Daddy Issues: The Movie. The main plot begins with a pair of cliches that only get compounded. While this movie commendably portrays what kind of punishment the human body can take better than most of its peers, it only does so to a certain extent. A named character can take a gunshot to the back of the shoulder, but the exact same injury kills an extra instantly. The game's twisted villains are now part of a generic shadow organization. Tomb Raider is such a transparent reenactment of Indiana Jones, that the main villain is even named Vogel, just like the Nazi in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Moviegoers who never played the game might not notice a lot of this movie's flaws, but if you want to experience Tomb Raider in the best way possible, the game is still the superior version in every regard. It has more content than this 2-hour film. Its interactive nature makes the action more enjoyable. Visually, the game is far more stunning, especially the remastered version. The story, by Rhianna Pratchett, whose father was the late great author Terry Pratchett, is quite well-written, too. Plus, the game has been out so long, you could easily buy it for the same price or cheaper than a movie ticket, and get so much more bang for your buck.",Tomb Raider,9666

negative,"  Definitely some dumb cheesy scenes, but besides that it was pretty spot on about being gay and the struggles of coming out. However, since when are clich√© teen romance movies good? Or all we just pretending to like it because it's a gay love story? Yes, I appreciate movies like Love, Simon for opening up the film industry for more casual LGBTQ films; but that doesn't make this the ""BEST"" movie. Jennifer Garner was pretty great though, she was the only one casted well. That being said, it wasn't as bad as other bad teen romance movies; there wasn't an overwhelming amount of over exaggerated dramatic scenes, which is good.",Love Simon,7251
negative,"  Definitely the worst one. Being part of a saga demands to have come continuity between the movies before this one and in this case, it feels right from the first 5 minutes of the movie like an intent from the director to scratch over the movies before and try something new, even if in the process it could burn all the good stuff from before. It has just too many plot holes that can't be forgiven. It suggests viewers to go on an argument to leave it behind like trash consuming a lot of screen time. This movie has a lot of bad moments that don't fit in what you can consider a good movie, because frankly it's not.",The Last Jedi,161
negative,"  Definitely very boring and too long, but the unacceptable apects are the loopholes in the plot and the poor character arcs. As a Star Wars fan, it's sad to see the way Disney has gone with the new films. The Force Awakens tried to be a carbon copy of A New Hope thus opening large gaps in the story, while this film doesn't fill in any of the plot holes and doesn't even follow the plots introduced in Awakens. Who is Snoke? How'd he come into power? Nevermind - he's really dumb and is now dead. How do people think the Jedi are a myth only 30 years later? Why does no one know about ""The Force?"" Nah - anyone can tap into the force at will without training - especially people that are nobodies, go to arguably the greatest Jedi for training, get denied said training, decide to go meet two of the most powerful people of the dark side, and are equally as matched to them and manage to kill everyone and escape unscathed. I'm not going to mention anything about Luke Skywalker's character arc because it's so ridiculously off target there are way too many things to even break down. So basically, it's a disaster and the writers should be embarrassed with their efforts.",The Last Jedi,114

negative,"  did it communicate with you..AnnihilationThe far fetched idea is not only visible miles away before its station but even the priorities seem to fade off quite early before the scrutiny even begins. A smart adaptation with strict editing on writing section by Alex Garland is possibly the only reason why someone might survive this feature. But unfortunately as much as to-the-point and gripping the screenplay is, the execution lacks better editing as it chews on this slow pill for almost an extra half an hour (the runtime could have easily been of 90 minutes). Natalie Portman is devastatingly good and there is no flinching on that and on her supporting side Oscar Issac justifies its presence on the screen. Even though the genre depicts horror; which is on a head-scratching level (the ""help me"" cries will be enough for your nightmares) where even the elders might cringe on the seat, there are some genuinely good visuals that brightens the tone a bit. Annihilation is without a doubt no short on execution (Alex Garland hits perfect mark on executing the paper on screen) then whether it is to project a heart breaking action sequences or horror chills or even creative creatures but what it fails is on offering a newer perspective, better plotline and a good old tale.",Annihilation,4305

Oprah can't act to save her life, but her performance is Oscar-worthy compared to Mindy Kaling's, which has all the dynamic expression of a wet log.

negative,"  Disney really came up short with A Wrinkle in Time. There was so much opportunity with no follow through. The worlds that could have been created where endless but the worlds that were created where mundane. Although there was a lot of star power, it could not make up for the inexperienced acting of the three protagonists. This is a challenge with any film relying on child actors, but it was especially brought to light throughout this movie when big emotional scenes were missed due to poor acting.Similarly, the movie missed the mark with the messages it was trying to convey, getting lost in creating nice sound proverbs that main the film feel a fake deepness to it that most children would not understand. I am not a child, so I am not sure how children respond to the film. However, I feel it lacks any true imagination and does not give children anything solid to grasp on to.",A Wrinkle in Time,2993
negative,"  Disney really killed the Star Wars series by creating this movie, as well as the 7th. Please tell me that you can see that the 7th and 8th are exactly like the 4th and 5th, there is even a snow planet in the 8th, just like the 5th. Furthermore, the terrible humor made me choke on my popcorn, meaning I chocked many times. This isn't a dumb animation like the fucken Emoji movie, which by the way was terrible. Luke, Poe, Finn, and Ray's funny lines were fine, but what made me want to commit harakiri was when Lea started talking about her hair when she saw her brother for the first time in at least 10 years. Also, I know star wars is a SiFi and also has the force, but I think that someone surviving outer space and not dying from that blast like Lea did is really pushing the boundaries. To be honest, It would have made more sense if she had died there. Snoke's death was very anticlimactic and you can see the similarity between his and Palpatine's death in the 6th, where they both trusted their followers to do their work. You would think that the new Supreme Leader would have been smart enough to figure out that he connected Ray and Kylo too close so that their bond was strong. The French guy who turned on Fin and Rose, who by the way didn't really do much in the film, was probably the most creative character. We can't celebrate for Disney just yet, because the smuggler guy turned Finn and Rose in just as Lando Calrissian did to Han Solo in the 8th. I believe Disney messed up by not killing either Rose or Finn in the final scene where she saves him. Rose was a useful character up to the point that they were in battle, and there are too many main characters to live. The fact that Captain Phasma may have fallen to her death is unlikely, but if she did, that is really stupid on your part Disney. In final, I could get a bunch of guys who just do dumb Coca Cola commercials and have them make a more creative star wars than disney. First, they even kept the snow planet from the 4th, how can you be that much of a dumbass? Second, the repetitive death of the Supreme Leader, which came from the 6th. Hey, Rain Johnson, did you just copy the script from the 5th, add some its of the 6th and then use higher budget animations? Because if you did that, you did it right. I hope Karry Fisher, bless her soul, didn't see her scene with the hair thing, because I think she would have quit on the spot. Finally, I can't believe you dumb ass movie judges rated this movie a 91% and rated Jumper only 16%. At least that movie is original.",The Last Jedi,501

negative,"  Dissapointing. ""A Wrinkle in Time"" suffers from a lot of flaws. To be honest, I'm surprised the script got passed by the producers. It's weird but the exhibition in this film is either too much or not enough, so I was at either ""I get it, move on!"" or ""Wait, what!? Explain!."" The dialogue among the humans just doesn't sound like how regular human beings speak. It doesn't help that the kids who play the three main characters aren't good actors. The two boys in particular are wanting. Between the acting and the dialogue, the love interest kid is a wedged-in, purposeless dummy, and the super-intelligent younger brother is obnoxiously precocious and a bit hard to understand sometimes.The film does have some strong parts. All the big name actors who play the alien beings did a great job. In fact, this was probably my favorite performance by Reece Witherspoon as a weird, unintentionally rude alien. Visually, the effects, the costumes, and sets are all a joy to watch. Lot of creativity there.In fact, I liked the second act. The focus on the aliens and other planets are when things got good. Unfortunately, the third act focuses on the human characters again and falls into the mistakes of the drawn-out first act.Kids may enjoy the visuals here, but If you're a parent be prepared to be bored for part of this.",A Wrinkle in Time,3778

negative,"  DUMBEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME ""Annihilation""This highly praised movie from professional movie critics makes me wonder if they literally saw this film on drugs. Annihilation was boring, stupid; and oh did I mention - boring?They advertise this movie as a horror flick, but I thought horror flics are supposed to not put your audience to sleep - literally.I knew the film started off on the wrong foot when Natalie Portman's character, Leena, explained to a small room of university students, that ""one cell turns into two, then two into four, and four into eight."" Of course, these students are surprised because apparently, the elementary school they attended never taught them basic biology. I mean, is that really how you want to show how smart your main protagonist is? Could you imagine watching Ghostbusters and having Egon explain to you that water is wet because it's a liquid?Ugh.The movie just gets dumber and dumber by the minute from there.I'm going to give some spoilers here because it's really waste of time to watch. There are so many logical loopholes in it, the plot shouldn't exist..The premise revolves around a comet that crashed into a lighthouse and created a rainbow bubble around it the military called the shimmer. The military sent soldiers into the shimmer for the past three years, of which none returned alive. That is of course, until Leena's husband returns, dying, and not himself. The shimmer is seen as a threat to civilization by the military as it is expanding, and in a few short months, it could swallow nearby towns, cities, then the United States.So of course, the logical thing to do would be to drop a bomb on the lighthouse, right? Not in this world of snowflake filmmaking.The logical thing to do for these screenwriters is to send an all-woman team of scientists, not soldiers, into the shimmering, to see what's going on. Because sending in alpha-male soldiers didn't work before.....And bombing the alien lifeform that threatens civilization is just out of the question. Because, you know, this is all about woman power.The women literally walk into the shimmering, it's not a forcefield, and it gets even more ""treehuggerish"" from there. One by one, they get picked off by the alternative reality they walk into. Apparently, the shimmering is your ultimate GMO, blending human DNA with plant DNA, and possibly other animal DNA. Everything is crossbreeding in the shimmer without any hanky-panky. Two of the girls get killed by some type of oversized bear-dog that can literally roar, ""help me."" Another girl submits to the shimmer and turns into a flower tree. And the last woman goes into the lighthouse, evaporates into a colorful rainbow.In the end, Leena finds out her husband killed himself with a fire grenade and that the guy who came back is a clone. She also confronts a clone of herself in the lighthouse, that is so good at duplicating her looks, it actually even duplicated her clothes too, not a nude version. Usually, clones can only duplicate bodies, not clothes, right? Leena and her clone engage in a modern dance struggle/fight. I'm not even joking there, it's really stupid. Then she kills her clone with a simple fire grenade and runs out of the lighthouse. The clone incinerates, along with everything the shimmer created.Leena is later interviewed and asked if the aliens were here to hurt us, she answers,""No."" Even though for three years, soldiers, her friends, and her husband, went in and all got killed. She then is asked if the alien is carbon-based, and she answers, ""No."" Again, stupid.... because apparently, everything the shimmer created burned down.The if the movie doesn't get any dumber, Leena meets with her cloned husband. Apparently, everything the shimmer created was destroyed when it died, except for the cloned husband. And when she hugs her cloned husband, both their eyes glow and the screen fades to black.And that people, is the dumbest movie of the year.Annihilation is based upon a book that apparently sold pretty well. So well, that hardly anyone lined up to see the movie.",Annihilation,4418

negative,"  Edited review. Sorry, for some reason everything is coming in caps??? sorry!!Firstly, to the guy who keeps saying make it one star or more... If it was going to make a difference that 48% would have moved by now. Frankly, the RT % is falsified, it is not a real number. Which says all sorts of things about the authenticity of this site. Simply put: Shame on you RT.This foolishly made film was more a transparent join the dots political manifesto than a coherent story. while one can understand someone with a political agenda making a pitch to 'sell' the feminist / anti capitalist concept, the fact that it was green lighted, and then the fact that it was accomplished so ham-fistedly really makes you wonder about those with decision-making responsibility at disney.I am one that thinks TFA set up the rest of a trilogy on a shaky footing (why make han and leia estranged, for example / why kill han / why make another giant space gun / why cast an emo as a villain). Be that as it may, rian johnson ruined any chance f this trilogy having any kind of satisfactory pay off. iconic characters were disposed of at a whim, new and stupid laws of the force were introduced, and what could have been a subtle addressing of diversity and gender equality in the SW universe were handled in a laughably embarrassing manner. it fells like it was written by an angst-ridden 18 year old gender-studies student with a chip on their shoulder.Oh, and when circumstances dictated that we had the perfect way to farewell poor carrie, that can was just kicked down the road.Rian Johnson should be ashamed of himself and if he was railroaded into making a political statement by kennedy, then he needs to grow a paid and defend himself.I am ashamed of everyone involved in this movie with the exception of mark hamill.

It completely drifted away from what made Star Wars great and it feels like we're being fed a social justice diatribe on screen. Every villain is a white guy and every hero is a feminist or minority fighting against the 1%. I get that we should be trying to be inclusive, but this was so obviously forced. It's as if it was written specifically for the Hollywood elite to stroke their own conscience. I'm not saying we shouldn't cast minorities or women to be the hero's, I'm all in favor of that.

When Mr. McGregor dies of a fatal heart-attack, Peter thinks that his troubles are over for good. But when the old farmer's snooty nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) moves into the house with bigger and better rabbit-traps than ever, Peter vows to drive him out forever, especially when Thomas starts falling for Bea....Before J.K Rowling brought Hogwarts to life, before J.R.R Tolkien took readers to the mystical land of Middle-Earth, hell even before Michael Bond introduced a lovable bear with a passion for marmalade, the most iconic series of children's literature that ever existed were the stories published by Beatrix Potter. One of the most important contributors to the conservation of the Lake District and the National Trust, she was best known for the publication of her animal stories between 1902 to 1930 with her most well-known creation being the mischievous Peter Rabbit. Since then her stories have been adapted multiple times over the years, from a 1971 ballet film, A CGI show on Nickelodeon, the autobiographical film in 2006 Miss Potter, which told the story of her tragic relationship with her publisher Frederick Warne and finally The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, a 1992 animated mini-series that, in this reviewer's opinion, is one of the most beautiful, underrated examples of British Animation which isn't suprising as it was created by Dianne Jackson, best known as the director of the more famous short The Snowman who sadly passed way in the middle of the show's production.Making a live-action adaptation of these timeless stories was admittedly going to be a hard task to do in this day and age where adaptations are the norm and trying to remain faithful to the spirit of the source material while also doing your own spin on it can make or break a task like this. But as Paul King's excellent Paddington films have shown us, it isn't impossible. So what do you after watching those examples........................................................................................................................you give it to the same Dick-heads who thought twerking Nativity doves and a movie about Emojis was a good idea!Of all the terrible live-action reboots that have disgraced the silver screen over the years such as Josie and the Pussycats, Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas, this may be the worst example of those films ever made. Taking Sony Pictures Animation's worst traits which include desperately trying to be hip and cool with kids, obnoxious comic-relief and adding in so many dated pop songs in their soundtracks and amping them up to eleven in this modernized train-wreck is an insult not only those timeless stories, but is a giant middle-finger to adaptations in general. Look, I know that directors and screenwriters have to change things up from time to time, but they at least either try to keep the spirit of the original story intact or tell an equally timeless story themselves that can stand on it's own as an excellent film on it's own right, like Disney's Animated films.This does neither as it's story is so cliched, predictable and boring that one can even notice that Sony has blatantly taken the entire plot from their own Hotel Transylvania in it's narrative structure of someone finally getting rid of his enemy, only to discover that another enemy has decided to live on their land and fall in love with a female relative of the protagonist.Aside from Sam Neill's amusing cameo as the classic Mr. McGregor and Domhnall Gleeson getting a few funny moments as the overly snooty Thomas, the cast ranging from James Corden's obnoxious Peter Rabbit, Daisy Ridley's annoying ""weird"" sister Cotton-tail, Rose Byrne's awful ""Pixie-Dream Girl"" stereotype Bea and the cameos of other Beatrix Potter characters ranging from Sia's Mrs. Tiggy Winkle who encourages theft and vandalism, Ewan Leslie's Pigling Bland, once one of the politest and nicest characters in Potter's stories whose now reduced to a bad running gag in which he has an eating disorder and screams all the time, and the once terrifying Mr. Tod (Fayssal Bazzi) whose now obsessed with streaking and parties, are all so painful to watch that it, (I can't believe I'm saying this) makes the Transformers from the Michael Bay films look more closer to their own source material than these examples.Animal Logic's skill in creating some of the most incredible character animation as seen in the Lego movies and Happy Feet is sadly wasted here, as aside from one sequence that uses some beautiful hand-drawn animation drawn in the art style of the books that shows Peter's backstory and the death of his father, most of the realistic character animation is not suitable for a film like this.Overall, Sony Animation's Peter Rabbit is a travesty of a film that spits, shits and vomits on the legacy of Miss Potter and serves as further proof as to why Sony has one of the worst mainstream animation studios out there. You'd think that their recent Razzie Awards for The Emoji Movie would teach them a lesson, apparently not!",Peter Rabbit,7879

negative,"  Everything good in this movie (and there is some) is from the book. Everything bad is the new material for the movie. They made an iconic scifi fantasy trite with lengthy speeches that just didn't work. The scary bits from the book that resembled The Prisoner or Twilight Zone episodes were cut down to make room for more self-help speeches and more material about the bad science and poor world building. The humor referenced modern stuff and didn't land. The music was ill fitting and the audio was terrible. Oprah Winfrey is a huge distraction from the role she's supposed to be.The good parts were that I haven't read the book since I was a child and the movie suggested what didn't occur to me at that time. It helps if you have a background in Dungeons and Dragons Planescape, because it seems obvious now that that is essentially what was going on. The guides are celestial angel-types, the traveling is actually through afterlife type worlds where your mind and morality mean more than physics, which is why so much attention is paid to feelings rather than the pittance paid to real world science.

And my dear Carrie Fisher was turned into a joke. Rian Johnson has no respect for fans or the universe that was built. He was handed a golden canvas and wiped his ass with it. Oh my god the schtick comedy was over the top and out of place, cringe at best. Trying way too hard to force comedic moments, and i swear there were a few times they obviously paused for laughs. Nothing Luke did in this film in character, it was so far out of character you were left scratching your head. Easily the worst piece of SW canon ever conceived. I encourage all to watch at least once to form your own oponion, but expect to be disappointed. This is where Star Wars dies, and aside from from re shooting and re writing 75% of the movie to release a ""directors"" cut or whatever you want to call it. Episode IX can't reverse this.

Admittedly, a very difficult movie to make based on the immense amount of cultural references, but it would have been better if they gave up on this project in the planning stages. Very bad experience.",Ready Player One,1183
negative,"  For anyone that is mildly interested in this movie as an adaptation from the book Simon Vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda, it fails miserably in most aspects. The only things that I feel this movie adapted correctly from the book are the character's physical appearances-- which are mediocre at best (they didn't even make Bieber a Golden Retriever). The rest of the movie, in my opinion, is so extremely subpar that I could barely follow the storyline and I've read the book multiple times. My roommate, who hasn't read the book, and I went to see it today and-- I kid you not-- they mention Bram's name, Nora's name, Garrett's name, and Nick's name a total of two times each at the maximum. The end of the movie rolled around and the big reveal for Blue (which failed miserably because everyone already knew who Blue was because the writers of the movie literally made Blue and Simon have a conversation about Halloween Oreos and then Bram turned around not even 3 minutes later and commented on Simon's Halloween Oreos at lunch) and my roommate literally turned to me and asked me who Blue was because Bram has so little screen time. The characters personalities also fall so incredibly flat that you find yourself liking Martin Addison only because he's the only character that develops any kind of personality. No, wait, I take that back. There's a character names Lyle (Yes, I know that name sounds incredibly unfamiliar to you. That would be because Lyle doesn't exist in the books.) that Simon believes is Blue for a short time-- which is utter bullshit because Simon knows that Blue goes to Creekwood and Lyle works at the Waffle House-- until they have a conversation and Lyle asks if Abby is single. I kid you not when I tell you that I think Bella from the Twilight movies had more character than Bram/Blue.Now, if you're thinking ""that's not too bad. I'm sure I'll understand the characters. I read the book and the movie probably stays true to the book"" no. You're wrong. I can count on one hand all the ways the movie stays true to the book: the characters names are all the same, Martin blackmails Simon (but he's much more aggressive and outright about it being a blackmail than he was in the book and doesn't try to deny it), Bram posts on the Tumblr page (but he does not write an ocean metaphor, instead he talks about a ferris wheel because the movie had to make a big deal out of a ferris wheel at the end when Bram and Simon ride together. Yeah, you read correctly, they ride a ferris wheel. Not a Tilt-A-Whirl.), Simon finds out that it's Bram when they meet at the carnival (but again, ferris wheel) and Simon and Bram have the same math class. That's it. That is all the accuracy you're going to get from the book.Now, let's talk inaccuracy. Not only does the movie make pointless changes like making Nora a baker (what?) and never holding the talent show, making Simon a senior in High school with a dream of college in LA (what?), and introducing a random Vice Principal that is unneeded and only there so everyone in the theater can laugh at how stupid he is. It also changes major plot elements. Leah, the anime loving, gay obsessed friend that is in love with Nick? Nah. She's in love with Simon and doesn't give two craps out anime or yaoi. In fact, she's not even emotionally repressed like in the book. Nah, she tries to tell Simon that she loves him. In fact, she gets mad at Simon (not for going to hang out with Abby and Nick without her because the whole gay bar scene/getting drunk and going back for the shirt scene/ getting grounded never happens) because Simon (who is incredibly off character for the Simon I loved in the books) gets her a date with Nick to try and keep Abby and Nick apart because HE IS ACTIVELY MESSING WITH HIS FRIENDS' LIVES IN THE MOVIE. Which is why Abby and Nick are mad at Simon in the movie-- because he was a major asshole and lied to his friends to keep them apart and help Martin. Speaking of Martin, he's the only character in the whole cast that I ended up liking, which is entirely wrong because he's a blackmailing asshole. They give him this big redemption scene with Abby and Simon at the Waffle House where he makes Abby believe that she deserves a ""superhero"" for a dad instead of who she got and then they make him a bullying victim because when he asks Abby to date him on the field at homecoming (You read that right, he steals the microphone from Taylor Metternich at homecoming during the National Anthem and asks Abby to date him with doves and everything) the entire school picks on him for failing. That's why he outs Simon in the movie-- because he got shot down and needed something to take the negative attention off of him. Now, you might be wondering how Simon and Blue stop talking if Simon never gets grounded for getting drunk (""But he gets drunk in the trailer?"" you say? Well, his parents apparently don't care because he didn't drive and is home before curfew.). Well, let me tell you, BLUE BLOCKS SIMON AFTER HE'S OUTED. You heard me. Gentle, kind, loving Blue blocks Simon's email because he's afraid of being out, but don't worry he's already told his family. So, I guess he just doesn't want the school to know until the very end when he rides the ferris wheel with Simon while the whole school watches because Simon posted an open announcement on the Tumblr page to get Blue there and apparently no one in the city had anything better to do than stand there for hours and watch Simon ride a ferris wheel while he waits for Blue. Okay..... sure. Now, let's talk Cal because surely they had to get one character right, right? Nah. Cal has like 5 speaking parts that amount to ""I'm going away for Christmas."" and ""No. I'm not Blue. Sorry, Simon"". The scene where they push each other on rolling chairs down halls? Never happens. The scene where Cal tells Simon he's Bi and asks him out? Never happens. Every scene with Cal ever? Never happens. Then how does Simon think Blue is Cal, you ask? Well, because he says he's going away to the middle of nowhere for Christmas and Blue also CONVENIENTLY is going away to a lake house with no wifi (which doesn't happen, but whatever.) It's fine though because he only thinks it's Cal for approximately five minutes before he's told otherwise. Whatever. The emails? They're about as long as texts and equally as irrelevant. Simon and Blue discuss little to nothing and, because of this, their entire relationship falls flat.Now, let's talk specific details they missed. Simon doesn't wear glasses. Bieber isn't a golden retriever. Nora isn't in a band. Alice doesn't exist. Blue doesn't ever mention his nauseation. There is no Tilt-A-Whirl. Garrett doesn't like Leah. There is no Mr. Wise and no english class. Ms. Albright is not redheaded, but African American. Nick doesn't play guitar. Abby doesn't take the bus to school (Simon picks her up because she lives in town). The cute shopping/eating Oreos scene never happens with Bram and Simon. There is no Orange Frost or alone time for them (in fact, their onscreen relationship time amounts to about 5 minutes). They do a production of Cabaret, not Oliver! Elliott Smith is never mentioned. Simon's email address is ""outmywindow1."" Nora doesn't ride to school with Simon. Simon's parents let him drive 4 other kids to school. Simon apparently has a Panic! At The Disco love. Leah has a dog. Abby doesn't dance and isn't a cheerleader. Leah doesn't draw. You never seen Bram play soccer or in a soccer uniform. Simon emails Blue onscreen, not before the movie starts like in the book, so I can only assume they've only talked for a few months by the end of the whole movie.Honestly, I'm sure there are more, the entire movie is a long, painfully horrible adaptation of a wonderful book. So, don't go see it if you want to actually watch Simon and Bram fall in love.",Love Simon,7587

I read the book a long time ago but didn't recall it being like this. They made the father quite cowardly and I didn't feel any attachment to any of the characters. The pacing either dwells too much on a lengthy dialogue full of cheese or just jumps all over glossing over plot. I was shocked upon learning this had a 100m budget.

negative,"  Grade: BRating: PG, 1 hour 46 minutesIn a Nutshell: I lived in Spain for a couple of years in my 20's, so I was curious to see Blue Sky Studio and 20th Century Fox would represent that beautiful country I fell in love with. I especially wanted to see how they would make what is normally a very brutal ""sport"" into a kid-friendly movie! I attended one bull fight in Spain. Once was enough. The truth is that bulls in the ring die a bloody, violent death. Does that sound like a kid movie to you?Honestly, I couldn't decide how I felt about this movie. The animation is colorful and sweet, but the backdrop for the entire story seems almost inappropriate for kids.Uplifting theme: We all have different dreams. Live yours.Control your fears.Flowers make the world a better place!Hate vs. love.Pets are family.Things I liked:Beautiful animation scenery and landscapes. Detailed animation brings richness to straw, dirt, water, chipped paint, and moisture on the bulls' nostrils. Based on The Story of Ferdinand , the original Disney short was first shown in 1938 and even won an Academy Award for Best Short! I thought it was funny when Ferdinand accidentally breathed in a caterpillar and then snorted out a fully-grown butterfly. Ha haThe film introduces kids to a few Spanish traditions which make the country unique and magical, such as flamenco dance, the flower festival (Feria de las flores), and white-washed streets lined with baskets of flowers. I liked it when they showed the old-fashioned, classic windmills of Spain and then the modernized windmills to contrast the rich tradition with the new Spain. It doesn't quite do for Spain what the movie Coco does for Mexico, but it was a nice start.Bull in a china shop. It had to be done.John Cena does a great job as the voice of Ferdinand.The dance battle scene was pretty cute.I never knew there was such a thing as a ""calming goat"" used around bulls. Kate McKinnon is a fantastic comedic actress, really bringing life to Lupe, the goofy goat.The Austrian horses may seem out of place in the movie, but the Lipizzaner show horses are actually really famous in Spain.Segways. Man, I love those. So much fun.It's amazing that they could build an entire feature film around a very short story.Nick Jonas' song Home has been nominated for a Golden Globe. The Ferdinand (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is sweet enough.Things I didn't like:It's not super funny with lots of quick laughs. The audience I watched the movie with was pretty quiet and didn't react much to what was happening on the screen.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles, but nothing important is said that would make those lines crucial to the story. They're just added in to enhance the flavor of Spain. The names of some of the characters are words in Spanish: Guapo (Handsome) and Valiente (Brave). The chase scene went from entertaining to completely ridiculous in about 2 seconds.Some movie critics complain that there are too many characters in this movie, but I didn't mind. Three great actors voiced the hedgehogs, yet I didn't even notice: Gina Rodriguez (I love her in Jane the VIRGIN), Gabriel Iglesias, and Daveed Diggs. They don't get that many lines, and you pay more attention to their antics than to their voices.Funny lines:""I've fallen and I can't giddy-up!"" - Austrian horse""I'm Una! I'm Dos! I'm Cuatro!"" - Hedgehogs""What happened to Tres?"" - Ferdinand""We do not speak of Tres."" - HedgehogsInteresting lines:""Why does not wanting to fight mean I'm scared?"" - Ferdinand (Great question! It often takes greater courage NOT to fight!)""If we don't look out for each other, who will?"" - FerdinandTips for parents: If your kids are sensitive to the horrors of killing animals for sport, this is not the movie for them. There is also a disgusting ""chop house"" scene that might turn your kids into vegans.It's a fairly long animation, and I noticed some of the younger children in the audience I sat with getting bored and fidgety.There is a scene where some characters sing and dance the ""Macarena."" Wow, young kids are definitely not going to know what that dance craze was. That was a LONG time ago!Your kids are probably going to want a pet hedgehog now. They may be shocked to learn that the adorable, little creatures don't come in pink and blue.There is sort of a gay undertone in that bulls are supposed to be manly and macho, yet Ferdinand just wants to play with flowers. In a trailer interview with wrestler-turned-actor John Cena, he explains that he can relate to Ferdinand and being judged, saying, ""Don't judge a bull by its cover."" Always a good lesson for your kids to learn. @trinaboice",Ferdinand,6022
negative,"  Grade: B-Rating: PG, 86 minutesIn a Nutshell: With original music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this gnome animation is a gentle introduction to Sir Arthur Conan Dole's classic story of Sherlock Holmes. It has action, comedy, good music, and uplifting themes, making it an entertaining movie for kids and watchable enough for parents.Tips for parents: Profanity like ""Cheese & Crackers!"" and ""Fertilizer!""You see quite a bit of a dancing gnome in a thong. If you saw the first Gnomeo & Juliet, you've already been introduced to Mankini, a character kids will laugh at, yet one who is pretty inappropriate for young children, in my opinion. The first Gnomeo & Juliet was rated G, but this one is PG for using some rude and suggestive humor. Mankini's appearances definitely bumped up the rating. There is some potty humor that will make most parents squirm.Some subtitlesAll British accents and landmarks in London.Uplifting theme: ""We all have our good and bad sides."" - Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor)""A man doesn't make you strong, but the right partner can make you stronger."" - Juliet (Emily Blunt)""We took our best friends for granted. We stopped listening. We stopped giving them the respect they deserved. They were the last thing we were thinking about and they should have been the first."" - JulietFamily and friendshipsThings I liked:Star-studded, award-winning voice talents include James McAvoy, Johhny Depp, Michael Caine, Emily Blunt, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Maggie Smith, and Mary J. Blige.The animation is very well done with impressively expressive characters.Lots of physical gags and entertaining visuals.Fun soundtrack of popular hits and new songs.It uses several different types of animation, which I thought was cleverly done.A couple of twists. I love twists.The sound effects were really good, allowing you to hear the clay pots and hear the weight of the gnomes.Stay to the end of the rolling credits to see a few more little things.Kids will like the use of modern technology in the story telling.Things I didn't like:Sherlock Gnomes is pretty annoying and not very likable. If only they had gotten Benedict Cumberbatch to play the voice! He does a fantastic job in the TV adaptation. That would have been awesome and hilarious. Don't get me wrong, because Johnny Depp was fine, but Cumberbatch as Sherlock...come on!There are a lot of jokes that kids simply won't get because they're references to older generations, like the River Dance gag.I started to get bored. It felt like a video I would put on for my kids at home to keep them occupied while I got some work done.Funny lines:""To be fair, it was needlessly complicated, but that's what super villains do."" - Moriarty",Sherlock Gnomes,8174
negative,"  Grade: C+Rating: PG, 1 hour 49 minutesIn a Nutshell: Despite its best intentions, A Wrinkle in Time is disappointing as a film, although kids will probably still like it.Based on the very popular book A Wrinkle in Time (Time Quintet) by Madeleine L'Engle , it doesn't quite deliver the magic I hoped for, especially since screenwriter Jennifer Lee had done such great work with Disney's Frozen , Zootopia (DVD) Wreck-It Ralph and even Frozen Fever. Tips for Parents:LOTS of moral lessons kids and parents can feel good about.Kids in perilMrs. Whatsit uses the word ""prodigious."" In case your kids ask you what it means, you can tell them ""remarkably or impressively great in extent, size, or degree."" Your kids will be so impressed that you know. BullyingNo profanity. Thank you!Multi-racial familyUplifting theme: The only way to defeat the darkness is to become the light.Love rescues""Be a warrior."" - Mrs. Which (Oprah)Center yourself. Become one with the universe and yourself.""The wound is the place where the light enters you."" - Mrs. WhoThings I liked:Chris Pine! I love him in anything.Storm Reid is adorable and did a pretty good job, although a bit straight-faced during most of the movie. Her best scene, by far, was with Chris Pine towards the end.It's a colorful ride. The gossiping flower scene was the best part of the film.Fun hairstyles on the Mrs.'s.Zach Galifinakus was pretty funny and did a lot with the very small role he was given.I think frequencies and energy are so interesting. If you're fascinated by science, check out A Wrinkle in Time Book of Fun, Facts, and Science Energy is everything.Some of the scenes were shot in gorgeous New Zealand.Things I didn't like:While director DuVernay was very enthusiastic and creative, her vision was probably overly ambitious, resulting in a choppy mess.A lot of the green screens look fake with some special effects that don't really work. Some weird moments with missing details. Sometimes I really wish directors would let me see their movies before they released them so that I could point out some of the mistakes that could be quickly fixed.Deric McCabe as Charles Wallace is super cute, but sometimes it was hard to understand what he was saying.I couldn't understand a word Storm Reid was saying during the tornado scene in the woods.Cliched scene where someone says, ""Do you trust me?""Mindy Kaling looked so awkward trying to run in her ridiculous dress. What was her character's purpose? She didn't actually do anything to help. Over-the-top make-up. The costumes were creative, but they looked like costumes.The ""Mrs's"" looked more fake than magical. You don't need to pay extra money to see this in IMAX. It's fine on the regular screen. Better yet, watch it when it comes out on Netflix.The dialogue may sound good in the book, but it's awkward in the movie.Lots of close-ups that don't really work.A scene in the second trailer was completely cut out of the movie.I actually looked at the clock on my cell phone. That's never a good sign.There's no real villain. There's only a wispy, menacing ""it."" Kids who haven't read the book might think that Oprah's character's name is Mrs. Witch. While Oprah really is bigger than life (I laughed when Mrs. Which was gigantic), her acting is not good. I heard her speak to a room full of 10,000 a number of years ago at the California Governor's Conference for Women and she was mesmerizing.Surprisingly, some of the acting was not good by quite a few of the other actors too. It felt forced and contrived.Interesting lines:""You can do this.

negative,"  Great concept poorly executed. Warning: Spoilers.Okay so the idea of an alien mutating and combining DNA is pretty cool. I wasn't a fan of the special effects (twist some plastic flowers around some treetrunks anyone?) but could have ignored that. However there were just too many plot holes that I couldn't ignore. I mean, just to list a couple off the top of my head:- Everything gets mutated. Sure, I get that. But then why did they lose track of time?- Why didn't the army hang-glide into the lighthouse? Or wingsuit? Or boat in? Or at least go in along the shoreline? Why send them in through the path of most resistance - i.e, the jungle?- Why didn't they firebomb the area once their teams stopped coming back, and they noticed the shimmer growing? - Why didn't the previous crew leave something *actually useful* on the video camera, instead of creepily cutting someone up. Like, a quick warning - ""hey guys, we're mutating, you probably are too, maybe you should get out and tell someone instead of going to the lighthouse. Also, be careful of the giant bear..."" would have been pretty damn useful.- basic army training: ""great work on finding a tower for us all to sleep in gals. Now, let's set up a watchperson on the ground where anyone can attack them, and have a massive lantern shining so we attract predators and ruin our night vision.""- why didn't the military units ever make it to the lighthouse? I mean, a team of scientists did. And it's not like their 'science powers' actually helped them. The thing that helped the most was guns. And you know who had guns and knows how to use them properly? All the previous military teams.I could go on, but I'll stop. this wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't great. I wouldn't watch it again.",Annihilation,3903

The plot tries to do too much; e.g. we are barely introduced to one important character before he get captured and put in a chain gang (and from then on really doesn't affect the story in any meaningful way). The back-to-back ""cliffhanger"" scenes also get tiring; it even seems that Lara's character acknowledges this when she says, ""Really?!"" after one particularly egregious example of having to escape a cliffhanger sequence 3 times in a row.

You may have heard it all before but it is a remake of the origanals. The battle of Crait was like the battle of Hoth (the rebellion, as it is now being called again, are being punished by the bad guys and they need to escape). Snoke makes Rey watch the Resistance be demolished in space (like Palpatine with Luke at the battle of Endor). The only new things was the casino which makes it feel like a Dinsey film not a Star Wars film, Luke's character and Star Wars trying to be comedy. Rey hardly has any training and still kicks ass (because of all the feminists today trying to say women are better), Ackbar, a great rebel leader loved by many fans, dies and nobody cared, Holdo takes over and cant be bothered telling her crew what her plan is, causing a huge fight between everybody and waite until most of the Resistance escape pods have been destroyed. Poe turns from a strict pilot who knows what to do to becoming a joker and making decisions he knows that are wrong to blow up a dreadnought, causing most of the fleet to vanquish.

A scientific theory known around the globe. That's the thing with movies. If the creators/directors just go from Point A straight to Point B, it is the fastest but also least captivating.

Sadly by the third act it becomes a mess of CGI and we do not even get a decent end battle between the Boseman and Jordan. Is it really to much to ask for some real fight choreography and stuntwork?Performances are great however from the cast , Boseman does well but feels like he's not given enough time to shine in his own film.Jordan is fine but far from the fantastic villain other reviewers have proclaimed killmonger to be.Serkis is great as always and chews up the scenary.Freeman is pretty much pointless and should have been left out of the film.",Black Panther,2575

Not only is the lead character a female (again I don't have a problem with this) but also saturated this film with females taking the lead on something because men are "" power-hungry misogynistic pigs."" So in an attempt to eradicate sexism, the film just welcomes it as long as a woman is speaking up. Also the love story between Rose and Finn felt rushed and unnecessary. I'm just saying, if Finn dies in that scene saving people, the movie would have been way better.

negative,"  Horrible acting, plot has too many holes. Seems like a social project in Political Correctness. ALL Women entering a dangerous region, carrying weapons. And they don't know how to use them. If fact they often choose not to use them. (HINT: When fighting monsters, use the bullets to kill them!) This was such a terrible movie, that if I were not with a couple who invited us to join them, my wife and I would have walked out. I lost all intrest 20 minutes into the movie. It became a very painful experience, and in the end made me question our friends judgement in picking movies. I'll never go to the theatre again! Now I remember, why I stopped going to the theater back in 2016. (I hate the Liberal elites who want to tell the majority of the country we voted for the wrong person, when they can't even make a good movie anymore. They should concentrate on acting, and not politics. They stand a better chance at being successful if they keep perfecting their craft. Because they suck at giving their political opinions to people who could care less about their pathetic, rich, drug fueled, pedo driven lifestyles in a fantasy world, that most intelligent people want nothing to do with.)

negative,"  Horrible adaptation. They removed the christianity from a Christian fantasy story and replaced it with daytime pop psychology. THey gutted the characterizations of both Mrs. Whatsit and the happy medium. Mrs. Whatsit's attitude towards meg was so annoying! It wouldn't be that hard to make a good film from the book. If they could do it with Harry Potter, they could do it with a wrinkle in time. They would just need to make a longer movie that focused on plot and character, not eye popping cgi! I want a version of A wrinkle in time that includes the twins, the star-gazing rock, and Aunt beastie! I know some changes would be inevitable, but this film actually complicated scenes that could have been simpler and therefore more powerful. The least they could have done to show respect for L'engle and her christian fans was to let them list jesus as a light. He is so much more, but they couldn't even do that. The talented and diverse cast is the only positive thing about this movie.The reason for making a beloved book into a film is having a ready audience in the fans. Why make the book into a movie, then drain it of everything the fans love? Why dumb it down for the sake of CGI?

Then the guard who gets two fingers bitten off by the hokey ""creature"" sees his kids off to school then we get to watch him hump his wife in bed. The narrative was classy too, such as ""You know corn flakes were invented to reduce masturbation."" And, ""as long as you have a finger left to put in her vagina."" The thing is, none of this narrative or vulgar scenes had ANYTHING to do with the plot.

They succeed and the animal goes into anaphylaxis and has to use his epi pen. How disgusting that they would put this in a kid's movie, not only making fun and light of kids with food allergies (and food allergies that are deadly no less), but it also gives bullies the bright idea to use deadly food to bully a kid with an allergy.

negative,"  How dare the folks creating and producing children's entertainment that normalizes brutality to those with a food allergy? Why does this film include a scene where the identified character with a life-threatening food allergy and is targeted to die by others ""shooting"" that allergic food into the mouth of the allergic character? This is a hideous message for all children, let alone the very young who struggle to understand how they fit into society where they might be killed by accidentally eating the wrong thing, but now, they might also be intentionally killed by a bully? The entertainment industry needs to have a food allergy ""Time's Up"" moment, as well. Especially when it comes to the messages we are bombarding our children with. It is absolutely wrong to normalize bullying a child with a life-threatening health condition they neither asked for, nor wanted, but will have to spend the rest of their life trying to deal with. To include narratives where bullies go after those with an anaphylactic allergy just for laughs is nothing short of sociopathic. Writers, producers, directors, comedians should raise the bar when it comes to food allergies, because making fun of someone, usually a child, who can die from, say eating a peanut, is the same kind of cruel humor we longer tolerate anywhere else because it's just plain wrong. Didn't Punch and Judy in the Victorian age do comedy where ""the baby"" was constantly killed? Why isn't that done now? Well, because it's a crappy message, frankly, and targeting kids with life-threatening food allergies is the same thing. Stop using children's entertainment to normalize any bullying. Especially toward children who suffer great depression and enormous anxiety, and loneliness about the dangers of their allergy. When I was very young my mother took me to the Lake District to go see where Beatrix Potter lived. We owned every copy in print of her lovely, gentle, sweet books (Tales). I find it tragic that almost everything her work was about is being hacked and twisted into some angry, sociopathic war movie with messages of bullying and harm and anger being the driving force of the film. Not sure which writer came up with a film with hostility toward Potter as it's core engine, but it should appeal to those who don't care a bit about raising healthy children.",Peter Rabbit,8118

It felt a lot like the prequels because of that. The tone of Rogue One was good and it's one of my favorite in the series. They need to try to stick to that tone. I don't know where Lucasfilm every got the idea that fans want comedy in Star Wars. Is it because Han Solo was sarcastic in the original trilogy and fans loved it? When the OT started to derail with the Ewoks, there was fan blow-back.

negative,"  I almost forgot that Disney Films has a branch devoted to kids. A Wrinkle In Time is aimed narrowly at a pre-teen female demographic. This is a pretty weak story wrapped in some heavy production design. The 3 Mrs-es, played by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, and Oprah Winfrey don't really stretch anyone's acting chops. Zach Galifianakis is along for the ride. That made me say, ""uh ... hmm?"" The movie rests heavily and somewhat uncomfortably on the shoulders of its young stars, Storm Reid and Derec McCabe. Director Ava DuVernay failed to bring out subtley or clarity in Reid's young girl who wants to reunite with her father. McCabe is miscast as an awkwardly named Charles Wallace. The performance is further damaged by bad sound mixing for his vocal range, such that a number of his lines get lost in a mumbly undertone. He has to turn evil for a while, and it's just a mess. There is another young actor playing a character of Calvin, who seems to be along for no reason whatsoever, and whom the screenplay seems to forget about for a really long time about 2/3rds in. This movie needed to be either more completely realistic or more completely fantastical. It could be that this movie is just lost to my AARP age bracket, but sadly I say that despite the pile of Disney money on screen, it lacks the magic of something like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is clearly best example of what it might have been aiming for.

This movie is about as anti-American and insulting to black Americans as any I've seen. It suggests that blacks in the US are so pathetic as to be unable to do anything for themselves, and that America is so lacking that spaceship flying Africans have to bring aid to help them. It is anti-capitalist. It presents a society in the middle of Africa that looks like any US city with US type tastes and activities and language. The only thing African about it is the superficial dress and kitsch hanging on stalls. It's insulting to Africans. It suggests that blacks all over the world are somehow linked to one another when the opening sequence contains blacks enslaving blacks, killing blacks, and separated into multiple factions.

negative,"  I can't believe how bad this movie was. I've been a huge Star Wars fan since I was 6, and this movie was horrible. The characters we've come to love are exploited in what is essentially creative expression gone wild. It ignores established character traits, and attempts to create emotionally charged connections with new characters we don't even hear speak. Creating very awkward distractions. Star Wars has always tweaked the laws of physics to a certain extent, but the opening battle is ridiculously over the top. Not to mention the first orders ridiculously poor performance. Worst yet the plot try's to reference today's political atmosphere in not so subtle references to feminism, racism, and Marxist references to social inequality. An all to familiar pattern now of the bad white men was quite oblivious. The only exception (Poe) essentially acting like a child who won't listen to his mothers. That is when he wasn't killing everyone by himself. Seriously it was like watching someone play Mario cart at times. I'm going to try and forget this movie was ever made.",The Last Jedi,95

My greatest disappointment is that no worthier movie will be possible for the Annihilation series for many years because of one flagrantly disloyal adaptation. A cool aesthetic?

I thought it was a fun movie that gave just the right amount of respect to the original cast while introducing us to an engaging cast of new characters. I had high hopes for the future of the franchise until I saw this flaming bag of dog doo. After leaving the theater in shock at the total disrespect of the characters and the source material, I took a step back and decided that maybe my initial reaction was too strong. Maybe I needed to give it a second chance and accept that sometimes change is necessary to advance the overall narrative of a story. Unfortunately, after a second viewing my aversion to this movie has only deepened. It is painfully obvious to me that the powers that be who created this disaster of a movie sacrificed quality story telling to advance a political agenda(s).

Luke has been turned into a morose, cowardly, murderous douche-bag who looks like Sam Kinison. Finn is still an unfunny, bumbling, coward that brings nothing to the story. Rey's character was improved in my opinion however overall the story is a downer, the whole side story of Finn and Rose running off to Casino Royale was dull and ultimately stupid, introducing Benicio Del Toro's character was pointless, those little pog things were annoying and a vein attempt to create new merchandising for Disney. Snoke and Rey's backstory's being shrugged away as nothing was lazy and... stupid! The space battles were cool but there's little to like in this smelly nugget of sci-fi fantasy.

NOTHING FROM THE BOOK WAS UTILISED i swear to god i had my hand in my head throughout the movie thinking about how i paid real money to watch some cgi playground with no meaning at all. I don't even know how people are praising this movie?

I am just extremely disappointed in this movie the movie doesn't even suck it's just a mediocre movie that will probably be forgotten as ""that movie about video games and 80's stuff"""" instead of being remembered as a thought provoking movie like inception.The reason i gave this movie a one star and not like two is because i was expecting a lot form Spielberg especially when he was one of my favourite directors until well you know this thing came out. I don't know what he was thinking was out of greed and pure laziness or is it because he didn't know how to approach a movie like this. It's like he ripped out pages of the book dumped them into a bag picked out 5 random pages and said ""Yeah let's put this in the movie"" and dumped the rest of the pages.I am just gonna end this review/rant of how the movie sucked and say just read the book and skip this movie.",Ready Player One,1445

negative,  I find this rating hard to believe! Hated it!,The Shape of Water,8800
negative,"  I found it hard to care about a country whose existence made very little sense. If such a country with such recourses existed for millennia, world history would not be as it is today. How would the Atlantic Slave Trade have existed as it does in reality if such a material as 'vibranium' offered the possibilities it did? How would it be possible to hide such a recourse within a made-up boarder? Yes, Wakanda is supposedly mountain-locked, but I doubt the native people would have been unable to get in and out of the Wakandan region. Furthermore, I highly doubt they would want to keep such a material for themselves - if it is so amazingly good that it can fuel countries and heal people as it does in the film, why on earth would the Wakandan's not want to trade the material for wealth? They clearly must have and did, as 'Killmonger' (a terrible name that seems to have been thrown in for the sake of it, as this is still a comic-book movie) reveals that vibranium had travelled in the form of an axe-thing outside of Wakanda. Speaking of 'Killmonger', I am surprised as to the praise that has been given to such a character. I do not mind Killmonger's absurd racism, as characters - especially villains - should be allowed to have flawed opinoins. However, 'Killmonger' simply wants to take over the world with the ridiculous war-technologies created by Wakanda's princess (even though I do not see why an isolationist and secretive Wakanda would ever bother to have made such weapons. Wakandans would be facing no competition from foreign innovators, and so surely they would prefer to remain in stasis, much like Japan did during its isolationist period. The desire to cling on to backwards traditions, such as electing a King through combat, or even just a monarchy in itself, is seen to be held by the aristocracy and T'Challa himself, but this doesn't fit with the additional facts that Wakanda employs spies across the world and lives with gadgets only dreamt of. Are they involved and competing with the world and the times, or not?) because he tells us that he feels that he has been owed more from the world. If we are told of Killmonger's desires in one scene, rather than shown what Killmonger wants out of life through the way he lives it, how can he be considered a well-developed character? The idea of destroying the world isn't that interesting, either. I'm confused as to why 'Killmonger' wouldn't simply stick to wanting revenge on Wakanda for betraying him. Martin Freeman's character seemed a little out of place, as I did not understand why a CIA operative would voluntarily help out the Wakandan King, even though he is willing to make business with Wakanda's most wanted criminal, played by Andy Serkis. The problems with Andy Serkiss' character was simply his forced comedy - it made it ridiculous to believe that this is the only outsider to evade capture from the overly high-tech Wakandans for so long. Not to mention that I did not find any of the jokes funny. Of course, humour is subjective, but the comedy here seemed to mostly comprise of half-baked references to things in popular culture as well as the standard avoidance of catharsis in key scenes. I may retract that last complaint about the humour getting in the way drama, as during T'Challa's talks with his father, he is uninterrupted in chastising him. This brings me on to my complaints about the Wakandan culture and the conspiracy about T'Chacka and his brother. The death of T'Chacka's brother was not as emotional as the film seemed to want it to be received as, because the audience does not know T'Chacka or his brother. Why should I care about the death of some terrorist who I do not have a connection to? Furthermore, T'Chacka's blunder in not dealing with his nephew was distractingly stupid - he could have easily had the boy killed or better yet, just brought up in Wakanda. He definitely know about his existence, as the Wakandan's seem to know everything when it benefits them. The culture of the Panther god is thrown in and unexplored, which begs the question as to why it was included. The ability to speak to the dead was not in itself a flaw, but I would merely personally prefer it if the film did not look at the beliefs of the Wakandans as objectively true. The princess directly says in a line to the Ross that Wakanda's achievements are not made by magic, but it seems like they truly are, as their God seems to exist without a shadow of a doubt. Wakandans are unchallenged in their world view, even though there is clearly room in the film to explore the shortcomings of the backwards society which seems to hate foreigners unfairly.Lastly, I'll say that the action scens were not satysfying, largely due to their lack of importance. The challenges for the throne of Wakanda had no stakes, as it was obvious that T'Challa would be king and that T'Challa would be defeated but not killed by 'Killmonger'. T'Challa is thrown off a waterfall by 'Killmonger' instead of being brutally hacked to death ,which is what I would have wanted from such a villain who has 'kill' in his name. Yet why would the film end without T'Challa fixing everything? This is part of a series of films, only really involving one important character - The Black Panther. Was 'Killmonger' going to replace T'Challa as The Black Panther? Perhaps he should have, but of course not. I would have hoped that in working with the necessities of having T'Challa as the Black Panther at the film's start and end, so that other films are not affected by the Black Panther film, T'Challa would learn to become a villain in order to rule over his selfish Wakandan people, who turn their backs on the world to live in their own fantasies. The film would have worked similarly, though this would have allowed for a more interesting character in T'Challa, who actually changes more severely from hero to villain. The bloodless nature of the action, as well as the filming choices of the action scenes baffled me. One of the earlier fight scenes in Creed had severely impressed me, however I could not coherently take in some of the scenes with the Panther in the dark, and laughed out loud when one of the bald ladies supposedly had her throat slit. Also; spears are objectively inferior to guns, no matter what metal they are made from. I know it was probably supposed to be a joke when the lady calls guns 'primitive', but her combat prowess seemed cheated on screen, as she was effectively protected from harm by convenience and not killing efficiently enough to redeem such luck. Thus, watching her fight did not contain much interest to me, as I was effectively told that she was not supposed to lose a fight. Similarly, T'Challa was given so much technological advantage that there seemed to be little reason to worry about any of his fights. Thus, at the end of the day, what was the point of this movie? To entertain? That was hindered by the assurance that T'Challa will be The Black Panther for many films to come, and thus nothing too bad will happen to him. To educate? Wakanda is a ficitonal hodge-podge of African aesthetics (and even Indian ones, as to me it seemed that T'Challa was wearing kurtas and his love-interest was ineffectively wielding Chakrams. I don't know if these are also native to some African tribes as well) so I didn't really believe the supposed sincerity held within this comic book story. Oh, and the gorilla people living in mountain caves felt a little too much like a Tolkien rip-off for me - they even suddenly join in to turn the tide of the final brawl. Tolkien did not invent these ideas, but his over-use in the past century would make me additionally precautions in including ideas which can easily be found in his works.",Black Panther,2283
negative,"  I found many aspects of Black Panther to be copied from other Marvel films such as the Thor Trilogy such as dream sequence where both Thor & T'Challa interact with late fathers etc. Also Similar to Thors brother Loki assuming command of Asgard after Thors fall from grace similar to T'Challa's cousin assuming command of Wakanda after his fall from grace!Then we have T'Challa reluctantly on both parts teaming up with an outcast tribe similar to Thor teaming up with Loki & rebels to save Asgardians.Then we have T'Challa having secret relation due to his uncle having a kid who returns home after the old ruler of Wakanda dies to claim the throne just like in Thor 3 when Odin dies, Hela comes along & does the exact same thing!I even saw similarities between Thors Asgard protector Heimdal & Black Panthers Wakanda protector Okoye... both loyal to royal blood line!Had I not have seen & loved Thor films then I would have been blown away by Black Panther!",Black Panther,2476

It's rewritten version has a good message for young girls about claiming their value and developing self-esteem. I just wish they'd made it a new movie with its own storyline created just for it and left WRINKLE IN TIME for some group like a combination of Peter Jackson (finally managed to do Lord of the Rings, also believed something that couldn't translate to film) and the Wachowskis (whose amazing body of work shows, I think, they could capture the essence of the special affects to support the story.)",A Wrinkle in Time,3393

The excessive use of hand-to-hand combat in a society that is supposed to be advanced seems to imply that it is OK to fight. Nice message to minority kids. The use of war Rhinoceroses instead of mechanized weapons also makes no sense and would be met with outrage if this were any other movie set in modern times. Why are they selling baskets on the street in what should be the worlds most advanced city? And why is everyone wearing pimped out versions of ancient African ceremonial garments? Wouldn't that be like putting modern Europeans in powdered wigs and colonial clothing? The plot is a little thin, too. For example there is the small matter of T'Chala being alive, which means that he is unequivoqually still the king, everyone except warmonger should immediately recognize this and the big battle at the end should have simply been the completion of the sanctioned fight for the throne. Oh, except that war monger murdered Zuri in cold blood, which should have resulted in an immediate tribunal. Sorry, that whole portion of th emovie was justs rediculous. Then there's the whole James Bond rip-off complete with a casino, remote controlled cars and Felix Leiter, oops, I mean Everett Ross, the CIA agent. All pretty trite. In the end, a movie that could have been culturally transcendental ended up being about an angry boy growing up and taking revenge on the son of his father's killer. Stupid message.

negative,"  I grew up with the original trilogy. After an initial 32 year waiting to see luke and getting ripped off by force awakens, then another two to see him in his full glory, we get the last jedi. not only were there no big space battles, let a lone a bona fides lightsaber fight or two, but luke is, to put it too politely, underwhelming. This movie elevated the prequels, and vaulted return of the jedi to the best one of the eight episodes simply because of the missed opportunity with luke. what a shame. it did have some good individual moments and a good soundtrack. my interest in episode iX & beyond is minimal because of this movie.",The Last Jedi,283

negative,"  I guess I'm a bot. I don't review much, but I felt I needed to say I didn't like it. The movie urself wasn't the worst movie of the series, but at the end you're left with less you be excited about for the future than ever. There were scenes that may have been exciting, but for every one good scene, there were 2 bad ones. The reason posting this is because of a thought I had of why I didn't like it. Phantom menace was a worse movie, with less redeemable moments in the movie, but at the end, there was still stuff to look forward to like the eventual grown up Anikin Skywalker betraying the Jedi, obi wan, Yoda, mace windu, the Emporer's rise.... what you just saw was bad, but it'll lead to something good. Here, it's less bad, but I'm not looking forward to the future. I find the characters of Rey and Kylo to be bland. Finn is pointless, Poe is bad, Carrie Fisher is dead RIP.... there's nothing left. Kinda wish I never saw it too be honest.",The Last Jedi,832

negative,"  I had a hard time following this movie. The first hour is unbelievably slow. the whole movie is clunky and feels like each act was written by someone different. and does mrs. whatsit really turn into a giant lettuce leaf?! I haven't read the book, but I had to do some research and make sure that wasn't in the book. Thank God, it wasn't, which is why my kids enjoyed the book much more than the movie. The acting made this movie watchable, which is why I gave it an extra star than I would have. Chris Pine pulls off some a couple of good emotional scenes that had my wife tearing up. The visuals were also amazing, but good acting and beautiful imagery can't save this mess.",A Wrinkle in Time,3391

If you like the book at all, the 2004 version (also by disney) is much, much better, despite fewer bells and whistles. I suppose for someone who hasn't read the book, it would be ok. Otherwise, don't waste your money, go hunt up the older one.",A Wrinkle in Time,3486
negative,"  I had high hopes for this movie I was completely disappointed. This movie was a missed opportunity. They pick up the movie at the end of paul's life in prison in rome before his execution. they should have started the story when he was saul, a jewish Pharisee, his conversion, his preaching, travels etc. this movie depicts Christians as weak martyrs. James Faulkner is miscast for the role of paul as is Olivier martinez as Mauritius. he can barely speak a word of English. we needed subtitles just to understand him alone. they give the character of paul a condo for a prison cell, large, spacious, clean as a whistle lighted by torches and not a rat, snake or cockroach in sight. reality was that paul was kept in a prison cell where the sewage of rome ran through it and where he was forced to stand chained chest high in it with rats etc. swimming all around him. when mauriitius asks paul ""can your god heal my daughter"" paul's CONFUSED AND WEAK ANSWER IS ""I DON'T KNOW"" WELL, thank God for luke who comes in and saves the day. seriously? We need a movie showing the real power of our god, our savior and our gospel, not this.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7657
negative,"  I had high hopes that this reboot might have found their way through the video game to movie trap but that was wishful thinking. For a film that obviously had a good budget, the directing and story-line choices were abysmal at times. Worse though was the completely misguided casting of Lara Croft. Not once did I connect with Alicia Vikander which is too bad because she normally is a likable actor. It was an uninspiring performance of a character who is supposed to be extremely charismatic and a modern day Indiana Jones.

negative,"  I had no idea what I was getting into. I saw ""Disney"" and figured it was a safe bet to be a well put together and entertaining movie. Now I'm trying to figure out what was worse, the hurried clunky storyline that just felt like the director was checking off a to do list of scenes, the B flick level acting or cheesy makeup and effects. This may actually be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I feel like Disney owes us an apology for this monstrosity. Skip it and take the family out for a bunch of dental work or maybe spend 2 hours shopping in Walmart. These are more pleasant ideas than sitting through this ""film.""",A Wrinkle in Time,3225

I loved the book and i was hoping for a stunnig movie from the directer of the Ex-machina (one of my favoriete movie from 2014). What i get is one visual good movie but with the content of one pseudo-intellectual bullshit movie. That ending was a fucking mess. For the people who didn't read the book (which was completely set aside by Alex Garland), you don't have any idea of a great movie you could have had. The character of the biologist is so great in the book, but in the movie it was a fucking cliche of a character. All the structure of the book, and the misteries of the area X are but better that in the movie. I know my opinion is greatly influnced by my apreciacion of the book, but, i assure you, that if most people had read the book the score of this movie was way lower.ps(sorry for my english)",Annihilation,4067

negative,"  I have long ago learned that rotten tomato reviews are extremely unreliable. This movie had two huge problems. Number 1, the storytelling was atrocious and almost nonexistent. Number 2, the filmmakers treat the audience like idiots.

The movie was cute and decent until Kate McKinnons character, the most annoying ""side kick"" character ever, made the movie almost unbearable. Then throw in the German horses that only speak in memes and 10 year old slang, and you realize Fox animation was never going to learn from Disney to make their animated movies actually bearable for the parents being dragged into it. They can't even copy Pixars generic plot without screwing that up. Glad Disney bought them out.

negative,  I have not seen this film.,Jumanji,7066
negative,"  I have read the book. I am attempting to separate the two for the purpose of this review. tl;dr - It's a fun movie with lots of action. The main character is boring and the plot is a series of Dues Ex Machinas and straight up plot holes coinciding to form a resolution.Pros: Movie is fun. It has genuine laughs, thrills, and chills. The references are cool without feeling like advertising (mostly) and the acting is solid. The Oasis is gorgeous to look at and the action is amazing in 3d. Definitely see this in 3d if you can spring for it. The race is exactly as cool as the trailer implies and a Gundam fights Mechagodzilla with the Iron Giant which is pretty dope.Cons: Not clever at all. Wade is a generic everyman protagonist with the motivation of One Punch Man played straight instead of for laughs. Cooke shines and the movie should have been about her. Art3mis is more interesting than Wade by a wide margin. The final battle is cool, but there is so much more that could be done. Instead we see Wade driving around in his Delorian shooting various weapons out the window while seeing glimpses of other characters from various worlds who are probably doing much cooler stuff. Also in that previously mentioned Iron Giant + Gundam Vs Mechagodzilla fight the protagonist is none of those which should really disqualify him from being the protagonist. In the interest of spoilers I'm not going to go into detail about all the plot holes that exist in this movie, but there are a lot.Also if you haven't read the book, wait until you've seen the movie. You'll probably enjoy it more.",Ready Player One,1397
negative,  I have seen it. it's not that bad but its a bit of a let down,Peter Rabbit,7977
negative,"  I have to say, releasing your movie on the same weekend as the new Star Wars takes guts. It doesn't seem to take being a good movie, however, because Ferdinand isn't that good of a movie.For what it's worth, Ferdinand isn't a horrible movie. At the very least, it has a positive message to put out. The only complain I have against the animation is that the animals often look too human and the humans don't look human enough. Other than that, the animation holds up pretty well against other animated movies. The sound also stacks up well, but it sometimes falters. Inexplicably, the movie can lose its sense of audio balance. Dialogue or music can occasionally have too soft volume. Unfortunately for the movie, this happens at the worst possible moment: the climax, killing any emotional impact it could have had. The climax also suffers from a poor choice in soundtrack, which does not match the mood of the scene at all.Maybe Coco has spoiled me, but I was disappointed that a movie that portrays Spanish culture features almost no Hispanic actors in its main cast. There's not much cultural authenticity in this movie at all. In fact, for a movie that's all about defying stereotypes, it sure does feature a lot of benign stereotypes, notably David Tennant's (Doctor Who) Scottish bull. While I definitely would not call The Last Jedi a kids' movie, it probably is the better choice for kids right now.",Ferdinand,6021
negative,"  I have waited for this kind of movie for years. As a gay high schooler, I had really high hopes for this. It had some good parts. But it was written for a straight audience. I never felt myself within the character, despite Simon and I being almost the exact same person. I cried with disappointment on the ride home than I did while watching the movie I'm not saying that this movie isn't for anyone, it serves as a great stepping stone for straight people to understand the struggles of coming out.

At first I thought it may be good for small children (some of the characters were too cheesy to take seriously) but there are parts that may be too frightening for children. There is too much focus on weird psychedelic experiences and not enough character development. The touching parts weren't touching because it was all a joke. Surprised they got so many famous actors/actresses to participate.,A Wrinkle in Time,3443

negative,"  I honestly don't get the praise for this movie. The basic logic of this movie is completely unbelievable and down right dumb. Now I'm very cool with weird fantasy movies and honestly a maybe fish girl falling for a fishy, amazonian river god doesn't bother me. What bothers me is ever other dumb aspect of this movies story. The main plot focuses on how the U.S. want to study and disect the creature because it some how will give them an edge in the space race. That premise is flimsy at best as its never really explained why fish guy is important other than he can breath for a while outside of water. How that translates to traveling in space is beyond me, but thats the main plot. So the story focuses on a mute maid, who works at a top secret facility with the worlds worst security. The main bad guy gets two of his fingers bitten off early in the film, but the maids are apparently allowed to work alone in the room with the creature, so long as they only spend twenty minutes in there. The mute girl manages to form a relationship with fish guy and smuggles eggs and a fuckin record player in to the room where she loudly plays music and dances and nobody notices except the secret russian spy. Come on! They dont even put a cover on the damn things tank, thats a basic requirement for a home fish tank, let alone a creature that just bit a guys fingers off. And then of course there is the russians who want to kill the creature, so americans cant use it to win the space race (it justs so fucking stupid). Also our mute maid girl is an orphan found on a river bank in mexico and has weird scars on her neck which surprise, surprise turn into gills at the end of the film. The movie is in general just an uneven mess, much of the plot doesn't really matter and the characters are constantly questioning why their life sucks and they feel out of place. And hey, I get that the message of the movie is about feeling out of place and unloved, but the characters don't go anywhere, or evolve. Mute girl spends the movie in a constant child like fog where she eventually bangs a fish guy. Her gay artist friend is a failed artist, looking for love in all the wrong places and is the same guy at the beginning of the movie that he is at the end. Mute girls maid friend, just complains about being in a unloving relationship and just seems to be there as mute girls stereotypical black Jimminy Cricket friend. This movie simply does not deserve an oscar nomination.",The Shape of Water,8811
negative,"  I honestly don't understand the hype for this movie. While the cast is phenomenal, and the setting of the movie is beautiful,, this movie at best is an average Marvel movie, and a suckfest at worst. T'Challa might be the worst superhero of all time because he clearly doesn't care about human life throughout the movie, all he cares about is a resource that he supposedly owns until the villain shows up. And if that's not bad enough, he's character is just bland compared to his portrayal in Civil War. No nuance at all, his character just goes through the motions and does exactly what you expect him to do. His nation Wakanda is also awful. They are nothing but a bunch of rich elites letting everyone else in Africa starve and die. I guess this a commentary on how the government neglects black communities, but the parallels aren't the same at all. Plus when T'challa says Kilmonger is no better that the enemies, which clearly are suppose to be nations that colonized other nations, the movie is somewhat backwards in it's message because Wakanda is no better than it's enemies either. Sure by the end T'challa learns his lesson and begins a new era for his people, but it's only because the villain was right the whole time. Something which i haven't seen in a superhero movie since The Dark Knight.The villain is definitely the bragging point of this movie. Kilmonger is not only a humanized character that you sympathize with, but he is also a perfect foil to T'challa in that he is a physical threat, and a moral enemy that counterbalances T'challa throughout the movie.Whatever themes this movie was trying to get across were shoved down your throat until you asphyxiate, or come suddenly out of no where to the point that it shatters your suspension of disbelief. If you decide to skip this movie, you're not really missing anything except a great villain.",Black Panther,2044

Apparently, I wasn't the only one interested as the theater was near capacity (although the 20-screen complex was only offering this on one screen on opening weekend). Slow (and boring) start to the movie, but eventually the movie starts to pickup steam 35-40 minutes in with some exciting/scary/grotesque scenes and then the movie quickly falls flat again, with more boring flashbacks. The ending was anticlimactic which had the capacity audience leaving in silence (as in ""that's it?""). Natalie Portman is a talented actress and her skills were just wasted here.

negative,"  I love art house movies! But not this one. Being arty just for the sake of being artistic works to get Oscar nominations, apparently. It does not work for me. The story is an indirect copy of the amazing French movie 'Amelie' with a sea monster added. If characters are not well introduced they will not get sympathy from the audience. I didn't feel anything for the fake love story between the protagonist and the monster, because it was based on nothing. Great cast and of course great acting from experienced actors, but if the story is not right it doesn't elevate, it doesn't move and it will not inspire you. Let's be honest, that's what we all look for in a movie. The committee of the Oscars must have had a hard time making choices. The selection seems to be a confusing one, from intense love dramas to fantasy stories without depth. If this movie wins more than 1 Oscar the credibility of the ceremony will be under fire, as it is every year. @Korben_Dallas on Twitter",The Shape of Water,9000

This, while definitely original, is just a very bad film in general. Creating a sexual romance between a human and a fishman just.. did not work for me at all. I felt absolutely nothing for either of these characters because we're given nothing to care about, other than the fact that they feel alone. A+ writing right there!

Luke would have never have attacked a young Ben, and would have definitely left his planet. There was a lot missing from Leah's character as well. She obviously had some kind of training, but there was no mention of this at all. Rose was Underdeveloped and unneeded. What About Laura Derns' Character? Didn't like her character either. And this has nothing to do with the fact that they were women! Captain Phasma was awesome, but again, no character development and overwhelmingly unused.

negative,"  I loved this book (and trilogy) as a child and thought I would take my kids to see it. It reminded me of a bad Nickelodeon TV show. EVen with the big budget effect.

negative,"  I loved this book so much I read it 3 times. It is one of the best sci fi books to come out in years. The story is fresh, the characters are complex and 3 dimensional. This stakes are high in a life and death struggle against amazing odds with a faceless corporation bent on dominating the world. It's all set in a dystopian future with tons of 80's nostalgia. The movie has NONE OF IT!!! This is the worst adaptation I have ever seen! Until this point, M. Night Shyamalan's adaptation of ""The Last Airbender"" held that honor. Nearly every aspect of what made this book special is gone. All of the tasks to get Halliday's ""Egg"" have been completely changed. There are not even ""Gates"" to pass. Just collect the Keys. And if you loved the strong female lead of Artemis, Be prepared for a gut punch as she is put into a submissive roll where she literally says to Wade, "" you are more important than me.""

negative,"  I read the reviews before seeing it, so my expectations had been lowered and I'm glad they were. The visuals were amazing, but the story was just a bit thin, yet complicated at the same time if that makes sense.One recurring line in the film is ""I'm underwhelmed,"" which is ironic because that is exactly how this film makes you feel. They do all this work with the visuals, but the story line and the payoff are not worth it. As a result the film feels like a bunch of loosely connected scenes that you end up wanting to be explained or elaborated on, but they never get explained. For example, the scene we've all seen in the trailer of the suburban neighborhood where the kids are bouncing balls, lasts for just a couple minutes and we never return there. It is never explained. It is even curious why they would even cast an actress like Bellamy Young to play such a pointless character. There are scenes like that throughout the film.I never read the book, but I've seen movies that stay faithful to the book have this problem, so my guess is that's what happened: In trying to stay faithful to the original story, they created a movie that was just too thin and overly complicated and weird. Weird is okay, but you've got to add substance to justifiy it or at least make it make sense to the audience, which this film never does. By the end of the film, you're just like ""HUH?...Is that it?....2 hours and this is where we end up?""",A Wrinkle in Time,2949

Annihilation started off similarly, but couldn't get out of its own way.At a certain point - I just gave up on the characters. There was nothing there that tied them together, nothing that made them compelling for me or made me care for them or their plight. The attempts to to try to add a bit to Portman's character just fell flat for me. It's a shame, because there are some great actors there that just didn't have the characterization or script to make it work for them.I like science fiction and this could have been great science fiction firmly rooted in a little bit science fact (with the needed wiggle room). Instead we get a slow build with no real payoff and more questions and answers. In the end those questions that we are left with are just questions that I really didn't care about.The effects are well done and the movie looks great. But, that couldn't save what just became a mess to me. I hope Garland can rebound with his next movie.",Annihilation,4532

negative,"  I remember reading ""The Story of Ferdinand"" when I was a kid and enjoying it. Me remembering the story which is the basis for this movie (And also having a free pass and a coupon for a free popcorn.) motivated me to see this movie. While it is tough to expand a short children's book into a full length movie, I found myself not all that impressed with this movie. It is not terrible by any means, but it is just dull, formulaic and for the most part forgettable. The whole scene of Ferdinand and the bulls escaping in the trailer was recycled right out of ""Finding Dory"". There were also come comedic moments that were just as unoriginal. There are a few laughs here and there, but overall ""Ferdinand"" is just another by the numbers animated film.

negative,"  I saw this film based on the strong critic and audience ratings. For me, it fell flat and I came close to walking out. There was no depth or heart in the story or the characters, even though they tried. And it was classically predictable. On the plus side, Nick Robinson was well cast and did a good job in the lead role. Jennifer Garner's role was a walk-through and her performance was a B-. Worse was Josh Duhamel, who seems like a nice guy in real life and was appealing in Las Vegas in 2003-2008 and has done nothing of substance since. The rest of the characters were incredibly white-bread, a collection of cute kids with nice smiles. Based on the reviews, I suspect most people will like it.

This would have been a better animated movie, some of the dialogue and writing is very cringe worthy but might have been saved by animated characters. .",A Wrinkle in Time,3167
negative,"  I should preface this review by stating that I am not a gamer. I've never played the ""Tomb Raider"" video games, but like many, I'm familiar with the character of Lara Croft given the two previous movies. The video game got a reboot in 2013, which apparently means that a movie reboot was the natural next step. This iteration finds Academy Award winner Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl) as Croft. We learn that at a young age, her father (West) left his family to go in search of a hidden ancient tomb belonging to the Japanese Queen Himiko. It's been years since her father has been seen and is now presumed dead. Lara is strapped for cash, yet is leery about signing over the death papers, which would in turn give her his inheritance. She ultimately decides to sign the Declaration in Death papers and as part of the process is given an ancient artifact leading to a hidden basement of clues, texts, papers, and notes her father left behind. Her father's dying wish was to have his files on the Himiko case destroyed. She's too intrigued by what she finds, and disobeys his orders. Her inquisitive nature leads her to Hong Kong to finish her father's work. Lara learns the hard way that he wasn't the only one looking into Himiko's tomb when she's taken hostage by the Trinity group led by Mathias Vogel (Goggins).If the premise seems a bit generic, that's because Tomb Raider has that general quality about it. This isn't the Lara Croft type of movie we're used to as this iteration decides to tell the origins story of the character. Do we really need this? I'm so exhausted by origin stories. The new DC Extended Universe made the same poor choice with the Ben Affleck Batman. I think we could have rebooted the Lara Croft franchise and gone the James Bond approach by just casting a new actress and given her a fresh mission to go on while incorporating the father angle.The casting of Alicia Vikander is a daring choice as she doesn't quite fit the design we're used to seeing of the character from the games. I want to be clear though that it's not a bad thing despite the image people may have of her in their heads. Angelina Jolie originally played her and has the stature and masculinity typically associated with the character. We see Vikander's Croft trying to find her strength throughout this film. She's not quite the fighter we've come to expect. Vikander brings a softer edge to the character, which fits the origins/pre ""Lara Croft"" side of the character. She's a strong enough actress to carry this version of the character representing the everyday woman who, in this case, has distanced herself from her family's past but is now forced to confront her legacy. Vikander can also pull off the intelligence of the character as we find out her father's knack for solving clues and riddles has been passed down to her.A big film like this should be an action juggernaut. The first initial sequence follows Croft in a ""Capture the Flag"" style bike race through the narrow streets of London. It's a pretty slick chase that's one of the more exciting moments in the movie. Croft is a speedy character whether it's by bike or by foot. Too much of the rest of the action relies heavily on CG effects, poor CG effects to be exact. It begs me to wonder if the film's budget wasn't high enough to pull off what was asked for or if the stunts and tricks are too elaborate in the first place. I had the same conundrum while watching A Wrinkle in Time. It feels more aligned with The Mummy than say Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's missing the fun and humor that came with Indiana Jones. I get that they're different characters, but I want to feel the exciting thrill factor. Tomb Raider takes itself too seriously and isn't deep enough to find the mystery or urgency present.This is the biggest film to date for Norwegian director Roar Uthaug. I can't tell if the movie is attempting too much or too little. Is there too much going on with trying to reboot a franchise with an origins story and a new actress? Everyone involved is trying to make an exciting action film to be respected by the gamers who have invested countless hours with the character. At the same time, there's too little going on as the story and the characters are lacking any sort of creativity. I'm not a gamer, and I barely know Lara Croft from any other game, but even I don't feel a need for an origins story. Tomb Raider has a few good things going for it mainly with the leads. Alicia Vikander has the potential to make for a whip-smart Lara Croft. Walton Goggins, who was excellent in The Hateful Eight, is always reliable as the bad guy. He's sleazy and vial and just what is needed for this kind of movie. The ending leaves the impression the studio wants to create a new franchise as Lara realizes there are more secrets and skeletons in her father's closet. We start seeing that shift from innocent Lara to vengeful Lara. I'd be curious as to what Vikander will do with the character, but I wouldn't be saddened if a sequel didn't happen.Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies?

negative,"  I think that Star Wars fans should demand a remake of this film. Why not? If you order food at a restaurant and its not served the way you like you send it back to the kitchen. Well, this film is no different. To be fair, there were some good scenes that were interesting and enjoyable to watch. However, there were just too many mistakes made in this film. Many of the dramatic and emotional moments fell flat while other elements of the story were rushed and left unexplained. Its obvious that the writer/director didn't like Luke Skywalker. It showed throughout the depiction of the character. In addition, it feels as if the saga was hijacked in order to provide fans with a way out to make way for a new and different story line. Its not that new story development are a bad thing, but it was too much too fast. The film simply took too many liberties for a story as loved and cherished as Star Wars. So i'll repeat:, it was a nice try, but try again. I think the fans deserve a remake.",The Last Jedi,449
negative,"  I think the ""professional"" critics haven't read or watched enough good Sci-Fi to know what good mystery horror sci-fi should be like.

One thing is certain, Sci-Fi fans will watch this, because you have to watch, just in case it's one of the few rare gems you might find these days.If you love science in your science fiction, this movie will disappoint.

negative,"  I thought The Shape of Water was OK. Not amazing. Not great. Not mindblowing. Just a basic OK.Yet it won 4 oscars. Why?Complete story with all spoilers: The Shape of Water is the story of a lonely mute woman working as a janitor in an army facility during the 1950s, who falls for a weird sea man creature who's kept captive there by a heartless army man. With the help of her old gay neighboor artist friend who happens to have a lot of free time on his hand because photographs have rendered his work for the advertising industry obsolete, a russian spy scientist, and her black janitor lady friend, she manages to save the weird sea man from being killed and dissected away. As our mute hero takes care of the beast she somehow falls in love with it and reaches orgasmic bliss. The army man tries to find out what happened, and after first being cluesless eventually manages to figure it out and catches the heroic couple as the beast is about to be released back into the sea. They fight, they all die, but turns out the beast has magical powers that can bring himself and his new lover back to life. They both escape into the sea. The end.The visuals, the actors: all great.The story: kind of OKish.The creepiness level: quite high at times.Is that enough to win an oscar? Apparently it's enough to win 4 of them.Why?Well.This movie is about a team of broken people sticking it up to the man, all to save, and fuck, an alien, who somehow happens to have great magical powers.You can't really get more progressive than this.The traditional white man, with his stay-at-home wife and his 2 kids, is portrayed as a sadistical tyrant with no redeeming quality other than his effectiveness at his job (and he's clearly super triggered when that only quality is being questioned), while the team of mute lady, gay old dude, and fat black girl, are super strong super nice and super good. The alien, a creepy and dangerous cat-eating savage beast, is actually a wonderful lover and some kind of God who can bring back the deads.Add the husband of the black lady who's just useless and pathetic, and the guy from the restaurant that the old gay character is in love with who turns out to reject the gay's advances while at the same time clearly signaling he's a racist intolerant asshole, and you end up with a pretty clear message: kill the old traditional western culture as it has no value whatsoever, and chose instead to embrace savagery because it's actually magical and fucking hot.That is a message that Hollywood loves. Hence the Oscars.And I don't even think this message is *entirely* wrong, but where is the nuance here? There's no nuance at all. And zero nuance is almost always entirely wrong.",The Shape of Water,8646

If you have to cut major plot points and scenes out because they ""are not filmable"" then maybe you shouldn't film at all.

negative,"  I understand liberties have to be taken when converting a book to a movie, especially one that requires so much licencing. But it was hardly the same story. Why was this movie even made? Boring and disappointing. It felt rushed and incomplete. It had a lack of mystery, imagination, and adventure, as well as character development. Everything felt undeserved. Plus, though the OASIS scenes were cool, I really wasn't that impressed, and they still often felt like a clusterf.

negative,"  I waited until the movie came out on DVD and only watched once. I am not a hard-core fan, but I grew up with and loved the original trilogy. I had mixed opinions on the prequels, Force Awakens, and Rogue One. I critiqued Force Awakens for being somewhat of a re-hash with silly progressive maneuvers in tokenism. 1.) The progressive agenda that I mildly disliked in Force Awakens and Rogue One was doubled-down in this movie to an intolerable degree. The identity politics in casting became distracting, as if the director wanted to emphasize just how many women and people of color are in the Resistance. 2.) On a separate note, the desire for ""a twist at every turn"" and subvert fandom became jarring. Established elements and tropes of prior movies were discarded, much like a ""laser sword"" with and elitist disgust. 3.) The use of BB-8 and Porgs became increasingly less clever throughout the movie and were clearly watered-down advertisements. 4.) If the 3 or more story-lines were episodes of a Netflix series, the audience score would be much higher. However, instead of episodes, the disparate plots were thinly connected by a handful of scenes and billed as a single movie.",The Last Jedi,503

negative,"  I wanted to like Ready Player One more than I did. I've owned the book for a while, but just never managed to read it - based on reviews I've read, that might be a good thing as the movie seems to let some readers down more than I was.It's hard to not be more enthused about a Spielberg movie. This just never really felt like a Speilberg movie to me. It just seemed too rushed and too flashy... don't get me wrong, Uncle Steven can - and has done flashy and movies that made you feel like you were on the edge of your seat. This just felt overdone and more concerned with sensory overload than it did anything else.Ready Player One could be a new Willie Wonka - however, rather than the lessons we learned in from Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca and the rest - we get a basic badguy with basic badguy army looking for (cyber) world domination.Ready Player One tries so hard to get us to care about this fake world by delving into the history of the its creator. Unfortunately, those are the most human moments we get out of this one. Our leading characters don't have a hint of that type of a character arc this movie needed.I am hopeful another viewing might help like this one a little more than I did. Ready Player One is still a roller coaster ride with some great moments that is a lot of fun at times and well worth watching in a theater for the shock and awe value alone.",Ready Player One,1568

The casting was unbelievable, the celebrities playing over the top dress up was distracting, and the dialog *somehow* made even less sense than in the book. I was really disappointed.

negative,"  I was disappointed while watching Annihilation in the theater last night. My friend watching with me apologized for suggesting it, as she was unhappy as well. With 24 hours of thinking about it, still disappointed. The film meanders, yet doesn't hit enough points to make the degradation of the team apparent. This interfered with my suspension of disbelief, along with the supposed seriousness of the situation. 3 years of missing exploratory teams? No communication once inside? One would suspect the Southern Reach project was run by bottom feeders. I could see the movie compared to 2001 and Apocalypse Now, but the descent to madness isn't plotted out, and the transcendence of the final act isn't impactful. It doesn't work. Ex Machina worked, but I won't spend any more time on this failure.",Annihilation,4218
negative,"  I was excited about this movie and I wanted to like it despite the cheesy trailer, but it fell short. Love, Simon very much felt like a movie created by straight people for a straight audience so they could feel all liberal and progressive about themselves. This didn't feel real to me. Everything was generic. Everything was so generic that nothing about this movie felt specific to the queer experience-even coming out was framed as merely an example of a universal experience. Most infuriatingly vapid was the film's central metaphor, that being gay is like a ferris wheel because life has its ups and downs. The film's creators were clearly trying hard to make their straight audience identify with Simon, which is all well and good, but this easy identification comes at the expense of any truth or complexity in the story. Straight people may watch this and feel that they understand the gay experience because they too have their ups and downs and they too sometimes find it difficult to open up to people, but the gayness in Love, Simon is incredibly superficial. Most gays are not white, upper-middle class, suburban boys with two progressive parents and a little sister. I am all of those things, just like Simon, and yet I still found myself utterly unable to identify with him. There was nothing to identify with. His character had no substance. The other characters were no better.I'm glad that Hollywood has finally decided that it can sufficiently profit off gay people and allies for gay films to be a profitable endeavor, but the film industry can do better.One final note-I've heard this referred to as a romcom, but this film was neither particularly romantic nor a comedy. The jokes are sparse and seemed to be designed for a straight audience, just like the rest of the movie.",Love Simon,7306

Many of the plot lines from the book are are either skipped or done away with all together. The characters are misrepresented e.g. in the book Aech is described as a ""athletic Caucasian heterosexual male""(ch. 33) but in the movie he is some sort of robotic ogre person In the end despite the movies over 2 hour run time it felt rushed.

I love the prequels, I love almost everything star wars related, and even with all it's flaws, I enjoy Force Awakens (it was a rehash, and Rey was to perfect of a character, but it had promise). With this though, it's the first time that I didn't want to rewatch it, I didn't want to go back and see it again, I don't even want to go see Solo or 9. That's a problem if a fan such as I, who eats up almost everything star wars doesn't even want to see it or other things from this current trilogy any longer.",The Last Jedi,110
negative,"  I was excited to see Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft and Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, the supporting actor... Despite their performances, the movie was disappointing. The plot was straightforward and dull with forcefully added ""exotic"" moments where the enslaved island workers tried to communicate with Wu in cantonese with a weird accent. At the beginning of the movie, the representation of Hong Kong was outrageous; from the string of little red lanterns at the back of the cab to the ""fishing village"" in Aberdeen. If the director chose to show the present modern image of London in the movie, there seemed to be either a mismatch of time or Croft didn't only travel to Hong Kong, but also time travelled back to the 80s to search for Lu Ren and his boat albeit showing an equally present aerial shot of Hong Kong before all the nonsense happen.All in all, glad to see a diverse mix of actors and actress in the movie and Vikander's Lara Croft was not objectified in the movie.",Tomb Raider,10307

There's only one explanation: someone just finished reading the book and summarized it to Spielberg while they were both drunk, then while still hung-over Spielberg made a movie out of it. Forgot the order of things, mistaken one character for another and forgot half the things that made the book great, so he made something up as he went to fill the gaps.

negative,"  I was so disappointed by this film. A cast this solid in its acting strength (at least among the adult cast), a director this talented, a production so visionary in its use of color and style, and a source material as innovative as madeleine L'engle's seminal novel should have all come together to create a stellar film. somehow, as mysteriously as the mechanics of tesseracts, almost all the magic disappeared in the conversion from print to film. There are a few moments here and there that serve as inklings of the movie that this tried to be: Mrs. Which comforting Meg upon their arrival on Orion, Mrs. Whatsit's adorably verbose absent-mindedness, and the undeniable chemistry between the actors playing Meg's parents all leapt off the screen. But amid those brighter flashes was poor child acting, a distracting barrage of extreme close-ups for no discernible reason, obvious inflation of the run time through transparent plot devices (Calvin falling off Mrs. Whatsit as she was flying, some forest-tornado thing erupting on Camazotz, etc.), rushed lines that should be interesting but don't land due to the way they are filmed, and a host of other nuts and bolts issues that unforgivably weakened this film.

This doesn't sound like the Luke Skywalker we knew from the previous 3 movies.5) Leia had the ability to execute an unexplained force power without any training at all.6) The casino planet seemed completely unrelated and did not fit into the flow of the movie.7) Rey stsated that she already knew where she was from, and yet, was being called by Luke's lightsaber and the Jedi tree, which didn't really explain anything.I would strongly recommend against seeing this movie.",The Last Jedi,300

I did not realize how over-the-top the delivery would be from experienced actors. The 3 Mrses delivered their lines with an unnatural almost preachy zeal. I wonder if this was intentional, what the director was looking for. The young actors did great, Reid, Miller and especially Deric McCabe. Galifianakis' gives a good performance. Perhaps being a 'Happy Medium' he did not have to over-state like the other experienced actors. I think PeÒa is a great actor. His character lacks real antagonism but I suspect that is to keep it friendly for small children. The ending/climax happens quickly without proper setup/build, but this is good, because you will want to get out of there quicker. The movie was very corny, even for younger audience. We went for the visual effects, as much of the $100 million budget was spent in that department. Saw it in Real3D, thinking this would be stunning/mesmerizing.

The cinematography is beautiful and the effects are great, but the story and characters (other than Michael Shannon's) are just kind of dull. The choices made in the film are very odd and what could have been an interesting and possibly touching love story between outcasts is overshadowed by gratutitous nudity and sex scenes that seem out of place, sudden gore in an attempt to shock, and lack of any meaningful development between the two lovers. Although the time period is mildy fitting, it also seemed plagued by the typical ""White / Christian men are all evil, dumb, sexist and racist (or some combo thereof) and minorities, gays, people with disabilities and freaks of nature are all opressed but generally good-hearted and kind.

Scenes of masturbation in a bathtub, torture (of animals? Or a god? And of a mortally wounded man), oozing wounds, and the ecstatic consuming of junk food.... all distracted from the very thin story.

negative,"  I will say that I didn't enjoy this movie that much. I have to acknowledge there are some meaningful lines said from the characters, however, the plots are not attracting that much. Because the producer need to combine the jungle story with the teenager story, you need spend some time to introduce the teenager background, which is, in my opinion, a little bit redundant. This reduce the overall pace. If it is a pure jungle movie, action and adventure type, I will say it deserve more popcorns. But I do remember some meaningful lines (may not be exact the same ones because I cannot remember that clear):When you have only one life to spare, you have to treat it very seriously. You need to trust that you have this ability to fly the helicopter, just like I have the ability to become a dance fighter. If you dare push me again, I am gonna push back.Rely on each other and don't blink a second.The missing piece is not an object, it is you, pilot.

negative,"  I... kind of hated this film, and I feel bad saying that as there are not a lot of films I end up actively disliking upon viewing them. ""It was different from the book"" is no excuse because it's a film adaptation and some of the best adaptations I've seen take the heart and SPIRIT of a book without strictly following it line to line! This film, however, does the opposite--it removes the best parts of the book and keeps the most weak parts, adding to the weakness and even dragging it out.You know the ""happy medium"" that has been pretty universally terrible in every version? Well the actor himself is thankfully more tolerable here but I hope you enjoy watching people struggle to stand on one foot for half an hour (this scene drags on and onnnnnn). Similarly, the magical creature ride on the first planet they get to... in the book at least they had a reason for the ride, to see the darkness and watch light literally fight it off giving you further insight into what sort of wonderous creatures the 3 lady's are and how important the battle is... in the film that is ALL gone and you're left with less than stellar CGI with our characters stupidly grinning in ""wonder"", omg, how magical! Except we're flying for no reason. And there's an action sequence because we were dumb, and that's REALLY what I wanted to see-- Our characters (who are all supposed to be extremely smart) doing STUPID things.I'm going to have to bullet point the rest of this because I have so many complaints:* The witches are introduced and are stunning and beautiful the entire film. This is a problem because they're supposed to be seen as quirky homeless-types at the start (the sort of person you might genuinely be concerned your 7 year old is talking to) which makes their later glory/wisdom all the more surprising and meaningful.* Talking/moving flowers. Puke.* Calvin is useless in this film. The actor does fine (though all he really has to do is smile and praise our protagonist at weird moments). I would have cut film Calvin entirely, he contributes nothing plot-wise or theme-wise.* Meg is not portrayed as actually smart, she's just a normal high schooler dealing with the stereotypical high school bully problems. Charles Wallace isn't smart either--but they TALK about how smart he is and we see him drawing so that must mean he's smart, right?! No, that just means he likes doodling like every other kid.* Bouncing ball Camazotz scene: not terrible, actually. But it could have been a lot more unnerving and creepy. It was way too short and transitioned into my next complaint--* Beach scene. What the actual heck. Charles Wallace just gets brainwashed... because. Why not In the book he gets taken control of because he CHOOSES to go to IT, his hubris and feelings of superiority gets the best of him and leads to his downfall. So much more interesting than ""number number, okay, I'm bad now for no reason.""* Meg and her father. I admit that I loved the scene of them reuniting, that was well acted and sweet. But god almighty the movie deliberately chose not to address him leaving Charles Wallace behind and Meg being furious at him because of it. In fact, Meg isn't given a moment of bravery and sacrifice CHOOSING to return alone to try and save her brother, instead she just screams and refuses to get whisked away in the first place. Look, I get time restrictions and all but couldn't you have cut 10 minutes of rock balancing and green creature flying to actually give our characters a meaningful arc?In this movie people are special just because people say they are, not because they actually say or do anything special. The whole time I watched it I just cringed or groaned. Heck, I'll even say that the crappy tv movie was better than this one because at LEAST they got some of the arcs right (and I can forgive some bad effects since they obviously didn't have the money).",A Wrinkle in Time,2933

negative,"  If Star Wars: The Force Awakens left you intrigued over its mysteries and cliffhangers, lower your expectations now. Watching The Last Jedi, it's unclear whether Rian Johnson has never seen The Force Awakens, or was simply uninterested in the foundation it built for the new trilogy. Either way, nearly every plot thread and mystery established in TFA is at best ignored, and at worst given the most disappointing resolution possible.Even beyond its disregard for its immediate predecessor, The Last Jedi is so poorly written it's hard to believe. Plot holes, lore inconsistencies, and absurd conveniences abound. The entirety of the story hinges on a well-established character acting in complete contrast to his/her well-established personality, with almost no explanation. Future Star Wars films will have to work desperately to patch the holes blown into the fabric of this world and its workings, as The Last Jedi irreversibly changes the series' mechanics of space travel and combat. Further, the movie's shoehorned morals are at best nonsensical and at worst sociopathic. If you see the movie with a crowd, you will likely be able to hear the sound of eyes rolling in tandem at one particularly preachy scene, as Star Wars' new worst character delivers Star Wars' new worst line and demonstrates the film's creators' incredible lack of self-awareness.That said, some small amount of credit must be given for the film's striking visuals and a few standout performances. In particular, Mark Hamill gives perhaps the best performance yet in any Star Wars film and demonstrates his incredible professionalism in the face of a very poor script. Unfortunately, his talent, presence, and gravitas are dramatically underused.Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a nihilistic, depressing, and straight-up dumb story that squanders its nearly every opportunity, and leaves the Star Wars canon broken likely beyond repair.",The Last Jedi,113

I was hoping this movie would be as good, as charming, as wonderful as Pixar's earlier stuff. It's just plain not. And even when not comparing this movie to Pixar's earlier work, this movie still wasn't very good. The boy is not charming enough. The laughs aren't funny enough. The story isn't inspiring enough. The plot isn't captivating enough. Kids will of course like this ok. But overall, it's just not worth the reviews it got, plain and simple. Watch at your own risk.",Coco,4923
negative,"  If this wasn't ""Peter Rabbit"" but some generic animated film, I would have had far less problems with it. It is funny in places, and entertaining, but in the first half of the film displays an almost malicious under current with the rabbits dialogue more akin to some feral gang. I didn't really want my kids (5, 7, 9) to be watching it and siding with the rabbits. It's clearly been written with an American market in mind. By the end, the tone has changed and I don't consider the film a complete dead loss, but it's such a waste of potential. Paddington showed twice that you can retain the heart and charm of the original characters and themes. Peter rabbit is a lazy lowest common denominator effort that exists on the brash and lairy and a delight in violence that simply wasn't part of the potters original characters. Hence, in watching this I feel more like something was stolen from me rather than I wasn't intentional something new - a new worthy interpretation. It's like going to see the next terminator film only to find out it's about how humanity and skynet worked out their differences after a terminator fell in love with a resistance fighter, and most of the film unfolds in Shakespearian parlance. I ordered a hotdog, why did you bring me a falafel? I mean, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this felafel, other than the obvious fact it's not a hotdog. And that's real pity because I really wanted to like this film much more than I did, and really didn't have huge expectations, it was just so very far from the mark.",Peter Rabbit,7870

Here is a short list.1) Rey, although she may be a bit overpowered, I can look past that. Suspension of disbelief and all. She is a great character although the ""mirror of erised"" in the chamber of secrets scene tested that with me.2) Yoda schooling Luke. Even Masters have something to learn.3) Poe and the opening scene proving how great of a pilot he is. Everything after that in the scene is utter garbage. Nice slow moving bombers that get wiped out.4) Got to see a character that looks like Luke Skywalker on the screen. Does not act like Luke in any way. Even though he has been disenchanted, after years of exile, he would have decided to do something about it.There are a few other things.That being said...Those are FAR outweighed by the amount of canon destroying garbage that have been blended into this work. It has Star Wars THINGS in it, but it is NOT a work that positively contributes to the SW universe.Utter garbage. Here is the short list.1) Canto Blight. THE WHOLE THING. Especially broom ""boy"", but I will come back to that.2) DJ. Dumbest character ever.3) Maz Kanata's shoehorned ""appearance"". A VERY strong character wasted.4) Wasted Finn. Is he still FS?5) Holdo. Despicable character.Leia ""taught her everything she knew""? Really? Leia is a strong character that CARES about people and acts like it. Holdo cares about her authority and protects it instead of sharing what is going on. Waited until almost the ENTIRE flotilla of escape shuttles was wiped out before doing the ""Holdo Maneuver"". Really? What is up that that name?

negative,"  If you have not read the book of Ready Player One, you will not be disappointed with this movie. It's a fun, colourful and often funny adrenaline packed adventure, stuffed with nostalgia and references, sure to please movie lovers everywhere. HOWEVER, if you are like me and have the read the book and enjoyed it (the book is my all time favourite), you will be very disappointed. THIS IS YOUR OFFICIAL SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! From the first moment Wade enters the Oasis, one of the most iconic parts of the book, and the source of the book's name, is absent. By this I mean that the retro 'Ready Player One' starting screen that is described to happen before a player enters the Oasis is nowhere to be seen. But believe me when I tell you it gets worse. There is no Ludus (the school planet), the first challenge that in the book is the Tomb of Horrors and the copper key is a match of joust with the Lich King is replaced for an unexplained car race through New York that holds no reference or apparent connection to Halliday's life. And guess what. There are no gates. No gates whatsoever. Oh and I forgot to mention that Wade and Art3mis meet in real life just after the stacks are blown up, when they aren't supposed to meet until THE VERY END OF THE STORY The second challenge is substituted for a Shining challenge, which is unlikeable to say the very least. This is when we get some semblance to the book, with the final challenge being relatively accurate, apart from the fact that Daito is killed in the real world in the book, a moment that pulls on the heartstrings, is omitted from the movie.

We are shown that the husband has been copied, befriended his copy, and told his copy to find his wife. (which seems to be really, really stupid to me.) 3. Why did the cancer-ridden Doctor not also get copied? What was the point of the whole light show we got? 4. Once she knew that the husband was an alien copy. what was the point of the hug? Was she just happy that she got SOME version of her husband back?5. During the hug, why do her eyes change color? What was that supposed to tell us?Honestly, after overlooking most of the bull that was served in this film, I find myself begging for an ending that was, if not creative, then cliche; anything would have been better than what we got!I cannot recommend more that all humans that require some intellectual stimulation to enjoy a movie, avoid the crap out of this one.

negative,"  I'm honestly confused that this movie is getting the high marks that it is. I thought this was one of the worst movies Pixar has ever put out. I'm debating writing a big full review of this to explain exactly why, but for now - the music sucks (the songs and Giacchino's score which is one of his absolute worst), all the characters were the comedic relief, the acting was bleh, the story was shallow and formulaic, the jokes were all like Dreamworks level of ""satire,"" and even the character animation felt stock and lazy. I dunno, I didn't find much to like in this movie.",Coco,5279
negative,"  I'm just gonna keep this review short and sweet, just read the book. This movie doesn't explain about this world and what the hell happens, the only way to know what's happening in the movie is to read the book first. I watched this movie three times, with people with and without knowledge of what has happened in the book, and we all got the same conclusion, and that would be that this movie explains nothing, and does a lot of telling but not showing. I also feel like the first 2/3 of the movie was just rushed, and the character acting was just horrible, however the last 1/3 of the movie seemed like a entirely different movie, because the quality was actually really decent.....although I feel like there was just a lot of filler, which is strange because we they didn't explain a lot or even show the character personality that much.",A Wrinkle in Time,2988

negative,"  I'm not a major Star Wars fan. I came into this movie with some knowledge on the universe but not enough for me to care about continuity errors or many of the characters. Even then, this movie was not only a bore to sit through, given that the story could have been told in 50 minutes, but it offers nothing that other Star Wars movies don't already do. Many of the characters are incompetent and one-dimensional, the special effects, for the most part, aren't anything snazzy and border on bad, and the story is so padded you'll be glancing at your watch wondering when the movie will be over. At least ""that one scene"" (avoiding spoilers but everyone should know it) with Admiral Holdo is gorgeous. It's a filler movie, and a bad one at that.

negative,"  I'm not going to lie, I skimmed through it. I didn't even stay for the ending. The plot, the characters, and the romance were so badly constructed, it was torture. Only the cinematography (though the coloring could have looked less sickly with a little bit more orange or coral) and the premise were interesting and for those, I am going to give it 1 star. The acting was ok, so here is another 1/2 star. I recommend you to do something better with your free time (e.g. watch Pan's Labyrinth).",The Shape of Water,8469

negative,"  I'm not thinking I should just avoid movies whose title is one word that starts with the letter ""a"" - because this movie ... is literally the second coming of 2016's ""Arrival."" So there are a few things to understand. First; the company that makes the trailer is not associated with the movie production studio. The trailer led me to believe this was an awesome Jurassic World-esque action movie, though Annihilation seems to be intent on being a thought-provoking exploration film. In actuality however, it was a death-paced crawl colored by hollow and worthless tropes of characters and filled with pointless flashbacks about a dead husband that has no bearing to the overall story. The second thing to understand is that just because someone has a great idea, doesn't mean that lone idea is enough to populate a movie. Such is the case with Annihilation. You're watching this thing, falling asleep, actually sleeping, remaining asleep, and then 80% through you're like - oh hey, that's fairly clever. This is what happened with Arrival as well. Having a single good idea does not a movie make. Movies consist of a plethora of good ideas woven together to tell a story. If you only have the punchline of a joke, but not the setup, no one will laugh. Annihilation fails to succeed because while it contains a clever premise, and beautiful visuals, it lacks any sense of pacing, structure, and characters that can drive the film. What results is a film you leave thinking ""Maybe, if i stretch the limits of my imagination, I could conceive a world where this might make a good book"" but as a movie, this didn't work at all. ... IT COULD HAVE WORKED -- but they didn't capitalize on any of the things we wanted to see.

Every movie requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, but the screenwriter really abused that with glaringly unintelligent actions by characters that were supposed to be intelligent. Examples:In the years that it's been there, no one that has gone in to the shimmer has returned (including highly trained soldiers)? Well then, clearly 4 scientists should be able to do it with no escort.A GIANT mutated alligator attacks and takes a full magazine from an assault rife to kill? Taking boats instead of walking on land sounds like a good idea.They are smart enough to set up camp in the tower, but then set up watch on the ground 50 feet from the tower with a bright light on it?

While the Jolie Tomb Raider movies are not memorable in terms of story, there is no denying that she made a memorable character. Alicia Vikander's turn at this origin story leaves much to be desired, not in terms of acting, but in terms of caring. We simply don't get to care enough about Lara because there really isn't much there to care about. As a result, we don't really care that much about the story, her relationship with her father, or whatever secret shadow organization is pulling the strings for the inevitable sequel.

It's honestly been a long time since I've seen such an immeasurably dumb, narratively tone-deaf movie backed by a studio with such confidence. There's such an impossibly small amount of sense in this story that it's actually hard for me to believe some sort of snafu didn't happen between the Disney executives and the creative minds at hand.

negative,  In trying to make a Star Wars film that subverts the fans' expectations Rian Johnson seems to have forgotten that he is making the second film in a trilogy series. The Last Jedi forgets or disregards many of the seemingly important plot points set up by its predecessor and where it does link up to The Force Awakens it does so with a brazen capriciousness that gets to be predictable in it's own right. From mishandled characters and inconsequential sub plots to jokes that seem out of place in a galaxy far far away Star Wars fans deserve better.

negative,"  Infuriatingly, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" is far worse than I had steeled myself to expect based on various reviews and trailers. Granted, there are good points: excellent casting, good acting (in spite of the actors having little to work with), tactful modernization of the nearly 60 year old story, some clever original scenes, and (surprisingly) one or two well-executed scenes straight from the book. But a terrible screenplay and atrocious editing basically ruin the film (the last scene is a glacially-paced torture of cringe-worthy treacle). They made numerous ill-considered decisions about the narrative that weaken most of the characters in ways that seemed to me completely unnecessary, and - the greatest sin of all, to my mind - they simply do not appear to have trusted the book. And there is too much straight up exposition where one or two hints would suffice. The film's version of the story was flat... it lacked the depth, awe, reverence, humanity, compassion, and ""true-ness"" in the characters' reactions to the supernatural/spiritual forces they encounter that permeated L'Engle's story. The word ""universe"" is thrown about constantly but instead the focus is tight and myopic; not universal at all. I'm so disappointed.

I don't know why critics assumed fans would like this film; I can only guess they're not savvy to the Star Wars fandom. I'm also not sure where they get the idea that the story telling is decent as it is easily some of the worst I have seen in a movie. This is a sequel allegedly but you could easily not watch the Force Awakens as it throws all of the established plot threads and character personalities out the window to do its own thing. Its own thing being gaping plot holes in the star wars lore, badly written characters and pacing that baffles common sense.Visually it is stunning. But cleaning a toilet doesn't change the fact it is still a toilet. It is watchable, but I cannot watch it without shaking my head in frustration. This was the film that needed to answer questions so we could be excited for the final instalment in this new trilogy. Instead it wastes time and gives answers that carry little weight. Somewhere between the stolen motifs of the original trilogy and thoughtless meandering, the film lost itself.

Theres no excuse now. How does wakanda work? Now really? Why are some of the people ok with living in huts and stuff, while the rest of the country lives in a hyper futuristic city? But, even the hyper super duper citi, isn't that much hyper super. Why do they have a big main street with a market that looks like it was taken from a third world country? Why do they decide how is going to be king with a fight to the death? The cgi in the last fight scene between purple black panther and golden black panther is really bad.Really not a good movie and it creates a big number of problems for all the other films in this universe. Some of it was enjoyable, but then they had to talk about memes, or call someone a whiteboy, or a colonizer. Oh and if you need to do something, like stop a car, or save someone who was shot in the spine, or just have a holo-chat with your friend, you can use these super futuristic hyper technical vibranium balls that everyone wears as a bracelet. Yeah, just stick it in his spine and he is all fixed up. Who-hu. ugh.And I'm not even gonna talk about how the villain's plan to take over wakanda is just plain stupid for no good reason.

If they had left that out, the whole love scene with the creature would have been less gross and disgusting. And more innocent and beautiful. This backfired of them. - The animal cruelty. I cannot believe that they got away with having the creature eat the cat. And that they showed the cat's half eaten body. This was just wrong. Why couldn't they have stopped the creature before the cat got attacked?? Once again cruelty and images that were simply UNNECESSARY. - The way the sex scene with the security guy and his wife was filmed was also just really pointless. They couldn't have been under the blanket? Come on!It's always sad to see how all of the things that made the movie rated R, also ruined the whole experience.

The most important reason is that I saw the story coming from miles away. I know, it's a movie for kids and families, not an Agatha Christie. So I invite all those kids and families to come here and give a 4 or 5 star reviews. But from my point of view, if I see the plot twist coming from scene 1... then the film is ruined.

The hyperrealistic depictions of deep-space planets inspire awe at the wonder of life itself, and never for a second cast doubt on the reality of these other worlds.However, the visuals is where it stops.

negative,"  It's a rather rudimentary adaption of a book that is anything but. While the film lacks the tone and messaging that makes the book unique.

negative,"  It's been a couple of hours after watching Sherlock Gnomes and I still have alcohol working through my bloodstream (a byproduct of having to watch Sherlock Gnomes) and so I thought why not begin the review writing process and see where this goes. A little pretext first: I had no intention of watching this movie. Every time its trailer came before a movie I was watching, I cringed harder than I ever have. I cannot remember another movie trailer that I would describe as soul-killing as this one, with its emphasis on butt humor and an extended joke about a thong-wearing gnome farting in the mud. To watch this trailer was to look into the empty abyss and have it look back into you. It was this repulsed reaction that entertained my friend Ben Bailey so much that he insisted that we watch Sherlock Gnomes one fateful evening (he paid for my ticket and my suffering). I loaded up at the theater's bar and the bartender made the easiest upsell he ever did in his life, and I took my tall adult beverage, sat in the theater, and awaited the end, like a man heading toward execution. Then a funny thing happened and Sherlock Gnomes was not the film advertised in its abysmal, life-questioning trailer. It's still not great, though.Following the events from the 2011 original, Gnomeo and Juliet, the garden gnomes have relocated to a new home in London. Gnomeo (voiced by James McAvoy) and Juliet (voiced by Emily Blunt) are entrusted with the gnome-specific responsibilities of the garden by gnome leadership. I guess it's about making the place look nice. Anyway, Sherlock Gnomes (voiced by Johnny Depp) and his trusty sidekick Watson (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor) are looking into the disappearance of gnomes all over. One unfortunate day, while Gnomeo and Juliet are away from their garden, the rest of the gnomes have been kidnapped. Sherlock Gnomes and the others vow to find them, believing the culprit to be Sherlock's longtime nemesis, Moriarty (voiced by Jamie Demetriou).Remarkably, a solid 80 percent of the trailer for Sherlock Gnomes is not in the finished film. The fart Jacuzzi? Gone. The ""no ship Sherlock"" bit? Gone? The thong-wearing gnome twerking? Gone. This fascinates me. We've long been plagued with trailers that ultimately have moments not in the final product, but I've never seen a movie, let alone an animated feature, where the clear majority of its trailer does not exist. Animated films takes many years in development and are generally costly. If a live-action film cuts footage in its final edit, it lost those days of work. If an animated film cuts footage in its final edit, it lost months if possible years of toil. How does this happen? Was the trailer an intentional ruse meant to advertise a far more juvenile, base, and dispiriting movie? The trailer features several jokes or references that, I assumed, were never intended for the final product because these scenes involve the other gnomes who were kidnapped. That means they were animated and either radically changed the story or these jokes were cynically constructed to produce a misleading trailer to appeal t children with farts. This truly fascinates me and befuddles me, a worthy mystery for Sherlock Gnomes.The actual Sherlock Gnomes film I sat through wasn't actively painful but it wasn't particularly engaging or rewarding either, a mediocre children's movie that will vanish from memory upon the ride home. There were a handful of moments where I rolled my eyes but no joke, no pun, even approached the pain of that trailer. On the flip side, there was perhaps two jokes that drew a mild chuckle and that was it. For the majority of the 86-minute running time, I just sat and took it all in, never really engaging. It was boring yet inoffensive, colorful yet unimaginative, and derivative yet silly enough to be a trifle. The look of the animation as a bit more polished than I was anticipating. The use of lighting and scale is well balanced. The voice acting was acceptable from the star-studded cast and I didn't feel any great sadness for anyone's involvement. The lessons and plot twists will be predictable enough for someone over the age of eight, but hey, everybody needs to learn some time. The use of the Elton John song catalogue (he is a primary producer) is the most forced element in the film, elbowing in one song or another, including ""original songs"" that you won't even remember. Much like the rest, John's contributions are mediocre and easily forgotten.I kept wondering about the lazy world building and its implications. This is a clear application of Pixar's oft-used formula of the secret-life-of, this time with garden gnomes. Except there's a segment where Sherlock and Juliet go to a club populated with dolls, stuffed animals, and toys of all sorts. So it's not just garden gnomes that are secretly alive, it's also children's toys. Which means this is essentially the same universe as Toy Story. For whatever reason, and maybe it's a misplaced sense of novelty, we stick with the gnomes. These creatures worry about being smashed, though can they be put back together much like Humpty Dumpty (except he couldn't be put back together even with the help of all the king's men and horses, no never mind this references. Also, what good are horses going to do putting together the shattered pieces of an egg-man? Do horses have thumbs to pick up the broken pieces? I feel like this entire aside might be attributable to the alcohol still in my system). If breaking is their biggest fear, why do these gnomes take such unnecessary risks with their safety and well-being? When Gnomeo is tossing Juliet in the air atop a ladder, I worried for her little gnome life. This cavalier attitude prevails amidst the larger gnome community, and my only conclusion is that these creatures are either thrill-seeking junkies or masochists. Then I began thinking of the life of other garden gnomes. I assume most gnome-owners don't exactly have an entire menagerie of these things, and so the majority of gnome existence must seem awfully isolated and lonely. Their communities must be few and far between. Then I started thinking about transforming past Best Picture-winners into gnome format, and let's just say that 12 Years a Garden Gnome was not a good idea for anyone.This is a sequel and combined spin-off for the animated gnomes world, so the holdover characters often feel superfluous. This is clearly more of a Sherlock vehicle and there are even references to the Hound of Baskervilles and The Final Problem, among others. This is trying to establish a Sherlock Gnomes franchise first and foremost. The Gnomeo and Juliet subplot feels rushed and foolishly resolved. Now tasked with running the garden, Juliet feels overwhelmed with pressure and Gnomeo feels like he isn't getting attention. Rather than support her, or see things from her perspective, he pouts and accuses her of taking him for granted. To conclude this storyline, she actually apologizes, and I shouted, ""Apologize for what?"" A better rendition of this storyline is realized with Sherlock Gnomes repeatedly being indifferent to Watson's contributions. When the main theme, character arcs, and plot points involve new characters, you might as well get rid of the holdovers and go all-in on Sherlock Gnomes. Was there a picky audience that would have said, ""I will only accept another gnome-related children's film if it has the tiniest connection to the last gnome-related children's film""? Also, there's another garden gnome children's film on the horizon, Gnome Alone, so stay tuned, gnome aficionados.The victory is that Sherlock Gnomes is not the seventh-seal-breaking apocalyptic event that its reprehensible, punishing, life-sapping trailer suggested. Hooray for you, Sherlock Gnomes filmmakers. The finished product is still a mostly middling time-waster that feels like a Gnomes relaunch. I fully admit this movie was never intended for someone my age, but I attempted to see its merits for its intended audience. If you have young kids, this is a reasonable 86-minute time waster while you, presumably their parent, can do something, anything better with that time. Go back to that novel you keep pushing off. Have some alone time with yourself or another person. Or simply close your eyes and enjoy the silence. Whatever you do, Sherlock Gnomes is an adequately forgettable comic adventure that will afford you time to think.Nate's Grade: CUPDATE: Thanks to the amazing connectivity of the Internet, someone closely involved with the Sherlock Gnomes production contacted me to inform me that my theory about the trailer discrepancy was correct. Paramount;s marketing team wrote the trailer and insisted the production spend valuable time animating it. The more juvenile jokes were designed, as this source indicated, to put as many butts in the seats opening weekend, and that the marketing department knew best, and that was that. The production spent time creating scenes for a trailer they had no intention of ever being in the finished film, scenes that badly characterized what kind of movie it would be. You can blame Paramount's marketing department for the soul-killing trailer. Thanks, Sherlock Gnomes source, for reaching out and clearing up that mystery.",Sherlock Gnomes,8177

I'm honestly shocked it would get anything over 70%.This says a lot about critics being afraid to honestly review this movie.

negative,"  It's not the worst Star Wars installment, but it is close. From the space-chase context that lasts less than 24 hours, to Luke's enological character arc and incongruence to TFA (why the heck was Lors on Jakku with the map? Why was R2 shutdown until the map was presented?), and his ultimate pointless suicide, to Rose's last minute crash, monologue, and cliched kiss, to the structurally unproductive Canto Bight tangent and the waste of characters like Admiral Akbar, Snoke, Luke, Leia, and DJ, to the introduction of new, flat characters (Hodo, DJ), the Last Jedi offers great examples of how not to write and execute a screenplay. It will be taught as such in MFA programs forevermore! It simply misses the mark in its storytelling and doesn't smoothly fit within the larger trilogy and cannon. All this movie had to accomplish was to create a chemistry between Luke and Rey (pass the torch), one that is mutually beneficial and coherent. It failed and all these other issues are exacerbated by that failure. You can like the movie, you can think its funny, or unique, you can like the characters too (I love the new characters), but you can't argue its good writing, by any rational measure. And that is why this movie fails.",The Last Jedi,437
negative,  It's not without some breathtaking sequences but I think the whole thing plays it a little too safe for my taste.

It actually took a lot of plot points from Thor Ragnarok which is why I can't give it more than a 4.

This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.. it really was that BAD. Poor directing, poor acting, poor writing...

negative,"  I've often contended that ""boring"" is the worst thing a film can be. Wrinkle in Time makes me rethink that. An exercise in doing, saying & being too much, Wrinkle... certainly isn't boring, but it is bad. It has a lot in common with Tomorrowland: live-action, visually-heavy Disney fantasy-adventures, headed by lauded filmmakers, which celebrate braininess. But where Tomorrowland was simply misguided, Wrinkle... is a straight-up disaster. It gets credit for being Disney's most enigmatic, eccentric experiments in years, taking visual and philosophical cues from Jodorowsky and Kubrick. Unfortunately, all intended awe and wonder is swallowed up by good, old-fashioned ineptness.The story of a girl having to ""tesser"" across the universe to find her long-lost dad gets some things right, including the critical casting of the lead girl. Unfortunately, this engaging young actress can't quite right this time-traveling ship. The rest of the oddly-casted actors certainly don't help. Galifianakis plays a god-like being doing modern, self-aware schtick for some reason (""I like earthtones.""); Witherspoon's comic-relief is more annoyingly repetitve than funny; brilliant ad-libber Kaling is forced into delivering constant platitudes; and deus-ex-Oprah leans into stoicism instead of inspiration. These obnoxious side-characters disappear eventually, and the film gets better for it, with potent descriptions of the evil ""It"" and some great, creepy suburban set-pieces. But it's really too late at that point. So much has gone wrong in so many ways (clunky editing, awful exposition, abrasive music, unearned emotions, prescription drug commercial graphics, ill-timed humor, laughable performances, etc), blame must be placed on normally stellar director DuVernay (Selma) for how unwieldy the final product feels. A forgettable, messy waste of a great cast and iconic source material.",A Wrinkle in Time,3433
negative,"  I've waited a long time to write this review and probably do not have anything to say that has not already been said. I'm terribly disappointed in this movie and in the critical response to it. Critics look at films for such things as relevance, plot, structure. We study critical theory and look closer at a film than the general audience, priding ourselves for understanding such things as narrative and context. Critics look at every scene for often ridiculous pieces of evidence to apply to ambiguous theories and this is why critics are so often out of touch with what an audience enjoys. When people are enjoying a great story, critics are delving into the subtext and looking for inapplicable symbols to express their theory; whether its an insane focus on phallic and yonic symbolism or Freudian stretches to an Oedipal complex, or forcing the characters into a Marxist clash that doesn't exist in the script. Then you have a trainwreck of a film like this which audiences are immediately turned off to and somehow critics jump to the other side and praise the film for all of its worst attributes. Suddenly narrative does not matter. That the majority of the film was wasted on a subplot that made no sense somehow escapes the notice of critics. Those of us who criticize the film are lambasted as disillusioned ""fan boys"" or heckled for wishing the film was just like Empire. This is nonsense. This whole film was nonsense but what is particularly upsetting about it was its missed potential. Johnson introduced a number of compelling ideas, gave us a taste of them, had us lean in for a second, and then snatched it away for no reason at all. People say that the fans who disliked the film are holding on to the Skywalker legacy or some other nostalgia, but that's not true. I wanted new Star Wars. Nothing would have made me happier than having something new and exciting, but that's not what this film did. It kept making itself look like it was going to do that and then just pulled away and killed itself...every chance it got. There is no way that anyone watching this film can make sense of it because if there is a theme to this movie, it is that nothing matters. Nothing that happened before matters, and everything will just work itself out in the end so nothing that happens now matters, either. SPOILERS AHEAD: This film builds on J.J. Abrams' Episode VII which, while there were some issues with the film, was in retrospect a fairly solid platform for this trilogy to build upon. Abrams introduced some very compelling characters and integrated the familiar faces from the original franchise very well. There were some plot holes and a few inconsistencies and errors of logic (such as Han looking up at the sky and seeing the republic capitol planets exploding when he should not have been able to) but some of these are to be expected in Star Wars. The original films are full of logical fallacies that we can easily ignore. Johnson, however, took logical inconsistency to a whole new place. One very large problem that maybe other people aren't bothered with, are the issues with time. Previous films have also taken some liberty with the concept of time. Empire has Luke running to Dagobah and spending what seems to be months in training with Yoda in the same time that Han and Leia are spending a few hours running from Vader's fleet (which can be accounted for with the amount of time it might have taken them at sublight speed to reach Bespin). Episode II had Yoda assemble and transport an entire army of clone troopers from the outer rim to Geonosis in the couple of hours that Anakin and Obi-wan were held captive. The fleet in Rogue One manages to respond nearly instantly to an air strike call and the large battle at the end of the film despite that the supported characters were several hours ahead of them. In Episode 8, however, we're made to believe that a fleeing capitol ship containing the remnants of the resistance is given 16 hours worth of fuel (worst ticking clock device ever), and in that time, much of which is already consumed by Finn's recovery and attempted escape, Finn and Rose are able to flee the ship (which also made no sense with the device of the ship moving too fast for fighters to be able to attack it), jump to another star system, search a casino city, get arrested, spend a night in a jail cell, flee from the police, be ""rescued"" by another person, and get back to the place where the resistance is being pursued. This is a minor problem when you consider that nothing they did on that planet made any sense or had any real purpose. They had to find ""code breaker"" (spend two weeks coming up with that name, Disney?"", but they get arrested instead...but that's okay, we don't need code breaker anyway. He was the only person who could sneak them onto a star destroyer, but doesn't matter because there's another person in the jail cell with them who can do the same thing that he was the only possible person to do. Rey needs a teacher, but Luke won't do it...but that's okay, because she doesn't really need a teacher anyway. But then Yoda tells Luke that they can't lose Rey, so Luke does absolutely nothing to help her anyway. Luke dies, leaving no one to train Rey, but that's okay because the books that Yoda burned somehow made it onto the Falcon. The resistance is trapped in cave with only one way out and they lose the fight, but that's okay because there's another way out of the back that didn't exist before. Then you have Finn doing the one thing that gave his character real meaning. A decision that Finn made to put his fear aside to be the real hero and he commits himself and it's real and it's meaningful, but then Rose crashes into him and prevents it. And then somehow they make it from the middle of the plain surrounded by imperials with both of their vehicles completely destroyed, but somehow they beat the First Order back to the base and manage to escape with everyone else. Everything that was compelling and moving in this film was wasted with LAZY, LAZY, LAZY points of convenience. You can't throw that many ""coincidences"" into a film and expect anyone to find it meaningful. Everything that happened in this film cheapened the characters and their choices because nothing matters... some convenient coincidence will always be there to save the day. This is a mere fraction of the problems with this film.",The Last Jedi,131

negative,"  Jesus H, that was the most bizarre film I think I've ever watched. It was like a mix between Amelie and Beauty and the Beast, which might be acceptable, at least, were it not for the fact that a) the beast looked like a mutant lizard fish out of predator, b) Amelie didn't have the good sense not to have intercourse with it, three times c) we were reliably informed by the lead actress (who had to use hand gestures because she couldn't speak) that the predator's 'funangulator' sprouted from behind its pelvic bone. Call me over imaginative, but a 'funangulator' sprouting from a space more commonly designated (in humans) for a female's 'trunundular' is surely never going to be pretty, heaven forbid 'sexy'?! If you can magnanimously put the beastiality that gradually blossoms between these two creatures to one side - which, call me old fashioned, never seemed to quite go away (but rather kept haemorrhaging, perhaps in syncopation with the beasts throbbing funangulator) - I don't think I can say I've ever watched a film that has moved me so violently back and fore between gripping humanity to such disturbing depravity so quickly within the space of two hours in my entire life. It was like experiencing life with a split personality disorder. I couldn't watch the grizzly bits either, but it was clearly a powerful movie and well acted. My only wish would be to see some of the outtakes of the actors describing the funangulator. It must have caused a few laughs; if not made them question whether anything in the film was 'right'? America concerns me sometimes. How did they even..? Ugh",The Shape of Water,9063
negative,"  Jolie dodged an arrow with this oneTOMB RAIDERWe continue to hope that this ""video game curse"" will be lifted by some divine spell that will come from the skies and change the whole panorama of this kind of movies but let me tell you that the only part that this has to do with witchcraft is the craft (or lack there of). You can't fake your way out of a lack of vision and a good eye, just as you can't fake your way out of a horrid screenplay. Tomb Raider belongs in that category of bad which comprehends any other movie you've seen and, granted you have the ability to percept repetition, you'll eventually forget. It's an extremely dull, mind-numbing piece of wannabe entertainment who falls into this modern pretence that tension isn't found in character, story or camera but in cutting 5 times faster than an audience's beating heart. And when you've seen many movies your heart starts to beat solely when a movie breaks out of the mold, when it shows me something exciting. In the end, when there isn't even an attempt to be original, you'll end up with a story which me, an experienced viewer, and even the general moviegoing audience will know by hard, bit by bit. Cinema, amongst other things, is about mystery, what you hide from the audience, so when you display all you have at once and all you have is an exact copy of the movie that preceded you, my compassion won't be won. Tension doesn't come from cutting but knowing when to cut. Action isn't a direct result of turning on a camera and shooting from 6 different angles and joining them together later, but from making decisions (tough ones). Maybe, when Lara is taking out a shard off her leg, instead of cutting 6 times, choose just one shot where the impact is unavoidable. If it's entertainment you want, make me feel entertained! I'll just end by saying that these are not the movies that will survive in a decade or so, these are the ones forgotten. And that is the only thing that is reassuring to me.",Tomb Raider,9514

The way people act, especially toward a man with a gun at the end as so unrealistic that it takes you out of the movie entirely. People say this is a throwback to young Spielberg, but young Spielberg was all heart and soul. Now he is all politics and political correctness.

A snarky dismantling of what you enjoy about Star Wars in the first place. Rian Johnson may be a capable director, but as a writer, as a Star Wars curator, he's a smoking disaster.

negative,"  Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: for all its flaws, I loved the book. I went into the movie fully prepared for major changes; 75% of the book would not translate well on to the screen. The book was for people like me. The nerds, the people who are unapologetic about their adoration for things. The movie was not for nerds.All I've seen are reviews about ""too much nostalgia,"" but honestly? There wasn't enough. The characters' obsession with all things 80s wasn't in the movie and it really wasn't integral to the plot anyway. It didn't do anything for them, except a bit in the final challenge. That nerd-normalization that felt so good in the books just wasn't there. This wasn't a movie for me and I'm okay with that. It was a big blockbuster with a lot of references to pop culture.It was a bit boring truthfully; a lot of splash with no real plot and one dimensional characters. T.J. Miller's I-R0k was a highlight, which is actually a pretty sad commentary. Ben Mendelsohn' s live action scenes clearly show he's better than his character's over-the-top villainy.

negative,"  Let me save you two hours. The movie, while having the same title as the book from Van Dermeer, is not based on the book. It may broadly share some similarities with the book - but it got every single thing that made the book distinct and turned it into pure Hollywood sewage. I don't even know where to begin, but I'll just point out the big ones:* No lighthouse keeper - those insane sermons written on the wall of the tower? Gone. Replace them with HR Giger bulls**t, because clearly, that's what Hollywood sheep can compute.* The lighthouse, itself - It's too complicated to have the tunnel/tower separated from the Lighthouse, just smish those two together* The lighthouse, again - Just smash a meteor into it, we don't want to bother explaining the dormant alien in a hundred-year-old reflector* Biologist, Psychologist, Surveyor - Nope. Just call them Becky, Annabelle, Juanita, or whatever disposable vapid name that the screenwriter crapped out. Names were a luxury that Area X didn't afford.* Journals in the Lighthouse - We have cameras! Let's just leave a single SD card behind for no goddamned reason.* Journals in the Lighthouse - part the deux - Everyone was writing journals, that is how the main character is even portraying the first book. If they had even bothered to read through to the second book, they'd still only be getting the story from the clone. Maybe they were going for the Unreliable Narrator trope?* Biologist, part the deux - We can't have some squiggly little researcher, let's make her a PROFESSOR! WHO KNOWS HOW TO ARMY UP SOME ASSAULT RIFLES! No. How about you give a hat tip to the little people that make the machine run?* Hypnosis - HAHAHAHAHA! That is a fancy science word that the normies won't get. Let's just leave that out altogether. (From the back) How do we fit the word Annihilation into it? Just have the psychiatrist, Becky, offhandedly belt that spew out as an afterthought a la Darth Vader shouting ""NNNNNOOOOOOOO!"" because that is super classy.Apparently, white phosphorus make the big bad alien go away. The Southern Reach were slobbering windowlickers who didn't think of just sending in a nuke.

NOT due to lack of action, special effects or stupid Jar Jars... it FAILED miserable as it completely RUINED ALL of Star Wars mythology, Jedi force, the conflict of Sith and Jedi and made Luke Skywalker, my childhood hero a weak, old, useless past his time Jedi, NOTHING like how Obi One was portrayed! Similarly, while Luke had to get extensive Jedi training to be good at anything, and so was Anakin, Rey simply beat Kylo and Luke and others by just random forces! It's beyond pathetic! The whole going to the island was a waste of time, no training, no Jedi teachings, nothing! Stokes kill was pathetic, the whole Kylo Ren being a spoiled kid was weak, the SJW socialists non-sense was too much, Princess Leah somehow FLYING in the space back from explosion was stupid, dropping BOMB in the middle of space with no gravity, and WEAK unlikable characters were horrible and would NEVER generate any interest in the long run like the old movies did when I was a child. Also, the last scene was an EPIC FAILURE, it was a complete insult to all of Luke fans that he did NOT participate in an actual light sabre fight, and it was his ghost. It was literally icing on the cake! I watched Star Wars as a child and have followed it ever since like nothing else in my life and Disney, Hollywood Elite and SJW culture RUINED IT FOR ME... FOREVER. I will skip the last movie as there's literally no character worth watching is left on the franchise. I personally don't mind Rey, but they have butchered her character and her story is weak beyond belief!

Even if they overdid the CGI, and the charisma between Anakin Skywalker and Padme was terrible on Episodes 1-3, the rest of the acting was better and the story was solid.I always preferred Episode 4, 'A New Hope', because it stood on its own. Everything else is a sequel or a prequel.Even Rogue One was superior to this muddled mess. They should have made this one before Episodes 7 and 8.Now we have a wondering repetitious story line, poor editing, a budget that did not allow any retakes, a few cute but fakey puppets, a number of locations that were underused, AND original cast members that looked like they had Alzheimer's, with dull eyes and speech impediments.A sophomoric attempt at sci-fi.Notice how much lower the audience score was compared to the critics?Let me help with the story: Yoda is Darth Vader's father or grandfather.

Rey is Kylo Ren's twin sister or his daughter sent back in time.And Darth Vader is their love child.Interesting how Star Trek keeps getting better and Star Wars just gets worse.",The Last Jedi,734
negative,"  May the farce be with you...It's not the ""divisive"" choices taken with Luke's character. It's not the terrible sub-plots with Finn, Rose and Po. It's not the disregard or wasted potential of Snoke, Rey's parents, or Leia doing a Superman impression.It's the insultingly placed humour that undercuts the emotional impact of every. fucking. scene. I mean seriously. The opening with Hux and Po on loudspeaker is really funny... if it was the Lego adaptation?! Hux is a wasted character, seemed a bit off the hook Hitler style in 7, now he's just that really angry guy who provides comic relief. Oh wait, EVERY character in this film provides comic relief! Yay!... The jokes and gags weren't not funny, they were just so out of place and ultimately has ruined Star Wars. Wonderful. I love it when things become a parody of themselves.Yes, everything I listed in the first paragraph absolutely grinds my gears. I'm all for taking Star Wars in new directions, exploring more aspects of the force, new characters taking the story forward. But not when the aforementioned is executed in such a way that it pillages, burns and rapes the entire canon back catalogue.Can I believe Luke would act the way he does? No. However, if that's the way Rian Johnson wants to take the character, cool - but justify it to me. Make me actually believe Luke could take the path he did. Of course he could act out of character, but he was written in such a way that the only thing he had in common with Luke is that Mark Hamill played him...Here's my luke-warm response to Rians decisions:Fast foward to the end of TFA. The emotional weight and reward of finally seeing Luke, both Rey and Skywalker welling up as much as the John Williams score. Snap into TLJ, Rey gets the saber out again (wtf continuity rant for another time) and Luke just grimaces and throws it away like a comedy sketch? What the fuck?! The tone of this character is awful, there's just nothing in common with what we've seen previously. I must state again, I'm all for character development and seeing a new side, but this treatment was detrimental to not only everything that had come before, but to Luke as a standalone in the movie.I won't deliberate too long, can of worms and all... but the flashbacks of Luke and Kylo sleeping?Come on man, Luke could have felt Kylo's supposed conflicted feelings without physically waving over his head. The last time I checked, all Jedi (including Luke in early stages of force use) could sense presence and feelings from a distance. So now Luke is supposedly diminutive in his force sensing abilities compared to previous movies. Great. The whole entering Ben Solo's room at night then whipping out his big green is also fucked up. Luke is now a coward for going in Ben Solo's bedroom to attempt murder while he sleeps and his guard is down, then he's just a straight up pussy because he doesn't follow through (enter Kylo sith fit wake up routine).Rian could have done ANYTHING. But chose this? I cannot comprehend. Luke has seen a lot in the past, Dad Vader ring any bells? Guy who pretty much single handedly wiped out the Jedi. So if he sensed dark in Ben Solo, it would have been so much cooler if he faced up to him properly, fell out with Leia because he wanted to kill her son, Han stuck in the middle doing that shrugging thing like when the Ewoks come out of nowhere in ROTJ... there's some great family space opera shit right there! And because we have virtually no back story on the last 30 years, we're already robbed of emotional weight. Eurgh. I'm disgusted frankly.Swiftly moving on, now I've got the important shit out the way... Finn might as well have died in TFA. The one moment he had any purpose or gravitas, Rose (yawn) stops him from committing suicide. Great. What I wanna know is, how did Finn drag Rose all the way back from the first order front line into the abandoned Rebel base without getting shot down? Again, for another time...Rose is shocking. Po ""intless"" Dameron. Thanks.Leia Superman... so many things wrong with that, but bottom line she can't be in Episode 9. Now she's gonna have an expected but underwhelming death in that film. Great. But you killed Luke instead, even though Mark Hamill is still alive. Great.Anyway, I've gone off on one and missed out loads but hey! Nobody is reading this far anyway.",The Last Jedi,440

negative,"  MINOR SPOILERS.I was forced to go see this because my girlfriend is in it. She was great, as always, but was held down by the constraints of a relatively uninteresting story and a mediocre script. This could have been compelling and a fine start to a franchise. It wasn't. The script never popped. It never rose above the pedestrian. It never became memorable.The first 20 minutes of the film was totally wasted and could have been handled better with a mere three minutes of skillful writing. Several of the scenes were complete throwaways. Thus, the very weak first act failed to establish interest and convincingly build both the character origin and necessary relationships. Instead, we got a silly bike race. I can only recall a single outfit for Alicia, whose grace and beauty should have been far better utilized in the setup at the very least.The initial second act Hong Kong scene also a total waste that should have been cut from the script before production. Walter Goggins did a good job, but the villain he portrayed was a cardboard cutout without depth, sufficient motivation, or any redeeming qualities. A one-dimensional and unconvincing baddy who also couldn't overcome a boring script. His character created an unnecessary plot hole left unexplained and gaping like an open wound. Rote and verbatim oral and visual repetition of the subject of the whole quest seemed to indicate they knew the whole point of the story was weak and uninteresting. Rather than fix it, they just repeated it to make sure we didn't miss the little bit they had done. The twist wasn't one, and was obvious from the beginning, lifted wholesale from ROTLA III. The stakes never felt real or significant, although they should have. The final cliffhanger a seeming paradox that could have been easily resolved by the father, yet was inexplicably left to become the story's not-so-secret moving evil force. Had the father simply removed the impediment in his control, there wouldn't have been any story at all. Hard to believe that none of these things were addressed before the flat, mediocre script went into production.Hadn't seen Daniel Wu before. He was excellent, but just as they began to use him effectively, they cut his involvement and forgot what was working. Disintegrates into a CGI fest that mimics and palely echoes ROTLA. Still worth seeing if only for Alicia, but a very mediocre film. **.5 /*****. 49/62.",Tomb Raider,9423

negative,"  More like an After School Special.Initially I thought this is a very good movie but the more I thought about it, the lower my impression was. All the politically correct boxes where checked, white upper middle class, poor black girl from Baltimore, stereotypical over the top gay boy, obnoxious nerd, and the tri-factor of Black, Gay, and Jewish. Nick Robinson did not look 17, yet more like a college senior than high school senior. Jennifer Gardner as the mother/psychotherapist was not very in tune with her own child, and her acting was mediocre at best, and her later response to Simon's coming out was lackluster for a mental health professional, Josh Duhamel, Simon's father played a stereotypical one dimensional post college football jock. The Drama Coach was the funniest character and the Vice principal had 10 more minutes of screen time than necessary. I think my biggest problem was with the lack of response by parents of their sons force outing and more so the lack of repercussions faced by Nick's character. This is a great feel-good movie until you start think back on what you saw.",Love Simon,7592

It was more just .... what was the point? That Wakanda will be sharing it's tech with the world now?Definitely dissapointed and the 97% rating from critics is like usual complete and utter crap that is already being dispelled. 77% user rating now and that will likely drop.Critis and Hollywood need to get a grip, the people of the world don't like the tripe they try to command people they like.2.5/5 stars for me, I'll watchg it when it is on HBO again, but it is no Thor or Dr. Strange or Iron Man, I will tell you that.I actually thought Black Panther had a much stronger, better and more fulfilling war in Civil War than he didn in his own moie.",Black Panther,2817

negative,"  My honest belief is that this film ranks the worst star wars film so far. And I increasingly believe that the critics who scored highly of this movie is being paid to make the rating so high. Shame on them all for being a dishonest bunch. The film doesn't make any logical sense and it feels that it is disjoined from the Force Awakens. Killing Luke in this films tell most of the audience who grows up with it ""FUCK YOU"". Old people has no place in the star wars. If you are old, you die is basically what this film is about. I am not even getting on the perspective of that ridiculous purple vice admiral. The way she executes a plan is trying to enforce the concept women are ridiculous in decision making or something else entirely, I don't know. What I do know is the plot is stupid, not logical, ill thought out. The way to fix it could be saying that she thought theres a spy on board and hence she had to keep all plans to herself but we didn't see that writing anywhere. So what actually went on that purple head, absolutely no idea. Anyway, Snoke was kind of stupid. He didn't learn from history or from himself. When you got old, you got killed by your apprentice. It might be a sith tradition but should he actually guard against this Ben Solo? And Snoke probably was the only Sith Lord who never wielded a lightsaber. Whats going on there?

The characters are enjoyable but with all that being said the movie really drags on and is plagued with tons of awkward scenes that don't contributed to the movie in anyway. Tons of masturbation scenes just to show how lonely the main actress is. I guess to justify the sex scene she has with a fish man later, which is totally disgusting. You can't compare this to something like beauty and the beast. Anyone who says this is a great piece of art is delusional and look into things way to much to the point its borderline idiotic.

negative,"  Not a big fan of this film. Here's why:1) Making 'Jumanji' an Atari game was STUPID. Really? The jungle drums wouldn't have enticed 1996 Kid to play the game? It was an 'update' that didn't need to happen and it took away some of the magic of the original film. TOTALLY unnecessary and dopey change that will date the film. Kind of like in ""Hook"" when the lost boys start doing the ""Arsenio Hall"" whoop whoop whoop chant. 2) The original Jumanji was about the real dangers of the jungle of the past (animals, floods, hunters, etc.). This one tried to make things up to date by having humans with motorcycles being the villains. Again, nothing like the original story. I do realize that the film doesn't need to tell the same story again, but the original film had a lot of charm that had to do with it not being set in modern times.3) Language- First, I really don't care if swearing is in a movie. HOWEVER- this movie was clearly aimed at kids. The dopiness of the situation, the game aspect, etc. Why have all the language in there?4) Actors- Kevin Hart can be funny. Jack Black can be funny. But here, the lines were so dumb and it was like the writers said ""Okay, let's roll out the typical Hart/Black schtick - even though real characters wouldn't say this stuff"".Overall, I felt this was put together without a lot of respect for the original and it just comes off as a money grab rather than ""a good story that needed to be told"". I thought Johnson and Gillan were fine in it, for what it was. They did a good job with what they had. Making Jack Black's character a female was dopey and unfunny and felt completely forced. Same with Hart's character. He's always gonna be Kevin Hart.Oh, and I was disappointed that with Rhys Darby in a film, there was no band meeting (Flight of the Conchords reference). ;)",Jumanji,6245

However, this film shows a clearly psychologicaly flawed woman that falls ""in love"" with an "" intelligent"" see creature that at best would be described as seriously mentally handicapped if it were human. The film depicts the creature as fairly clueless to any deep thoughts beyond physical urges and child like. The film never shows why she loves it other than the fact he is rejected and flawed like her.

Any reviewer or critic calling this film a ""Masterpiece"" is written by either a woman and/or a SJW Shill, who gave the movie 5-Stars before they even saw it simply because it had a female cast.

negative,"  NOTE: Apparently RottenTomatoes doesnt count 1/2 star or zero star ratings, make sure you give this movie ONE STAR to be counted. There is something REALLY fishy going on with the reviews on this movie. Disney is DEFINITELY paying or influencing the reviews. MAKE YOUR VOICE COUNT AGAINST THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE.Review of Social Justice Wars : The Last Mary Sue & the Diversity Crew:I remember watching The Phantom Menace as a 17 year old when it first came out and thinking ""wow, there is no way any future Star Wars movie could possibly be worse than this"".But the universe, in all its infinite wisdom & patience, just laughed, and nearly 18 years later, an took the older, wearier, and more tired version of me and subjected him to this abortion of a film.Where to begin? let me try to go in order:1) Opening space battle: despite losing the Death Stars to small fighters, and having fought the Rebellion for 30+ years, the First Orders commanders are utterly unprepared when a single fighter manages to sneak past their big canons and severly damage their biggest dreadnought. Snoke was apparently unaware his capital ship, that he is on, now has a device that can track the Rebel fleet through hyperspace. Apparently the Galaxy Far Far away does not bother with gravity and vacuum, as the Rebel bombers literally ""drop"" bombs ""down"" in space. And the only way to release said bombs is with a remote control, one that is easily dropped, lost, or fumbled. Poe made a prank call to open up the movie.... HILARIOUS right!??2) Plot : what, in the name of all that is holy, was the point of that IDIOTIC Finn/Asian chick side quest? Not only did the out of place Casino planet fee straight out of a James Bond movie and UTTERLY took me out of the film (tuxedos, dice, popular Earth gambling games, etc), the entire side quest was COMPLETELY POINTLESS and served no purpose other than to give the two minority characters something to do. And when the hell did Rose fall in love with Finn? In the in-universe few HOURS they were together? Also according to the #MeToo movement, isnt Rose kissing Finn while he was almost passed out now considered ""Sexual Assault""? Imagine if Finn did that to Rose? And if the whole quest was to get in contact with a super rare Code Breaker (too bad they don't have R2 D2), what are the chances they would just HAPPEN to be locked in with an equally competent code breaker just in time to escape together? 3) Excessive SJW/Feminist/Political correctness. If I walk into a room and theres me (middle eastern), an African American, an Asian, a Jew, and a gay person (all mixed genders), great! No problem. Its when its artificially shoved down our throats and forced that it becomes an issue. Rose has no reason for existing other that to have an Asian character and fill in the diversity quota. She adds exactly zero to the plot and her removal would make no difference what so ever. Admiral Holdo is, in the most ham fisted literal sense, the purple haired, physical manifestation of modern day toxic feminism. She literally has purple hair, and her entire purpose to is put the ""mansplaining"" hot shot Poe in his place and to show that, despite her being completely and utterly stupid and irrational by any standard, she really isn't at all, and that this proves that all women really are rational, even when they are not. And its just men keeping them down! Speaking of which, apparently all competent leaders in this new Star Wars are women, and all the bumbling, incompetent ones are white stuffy men.4) The ""hyperspace ram"" scene. Oh my god this single scene just made the entire Star Wars saga completely and utterly irrelevant:A New Hope: ""Sir, we just analyzed the Death Star plans and devised a risky assault plan....""Just hyperspace ram it""ESB: ""Sir, our troops are assembled and ready to commence the ground assault against the Rebel base....""""Just hyperspace ram the Shield Generator, then hyperspace ram the Rebel base""Return of the Jedi : ""Sir, the Death Star is just ahead and we are preparing our fleet to....""""Just hyperspace ram the Death Star""""But sir, its protected by an energy shield from the Forest Moon of Endor""""Hyperspace Ram the Shield generator, then hyperspace ram the Death Star""Rogue One: ""We have the Death Star plans, but we need to deactivate the shield in order to be able to transmit it to the....""""Just hyperspace ram the shields until they are.... actually we can just hyperspace ram the Death Star anyways. I guess we dont need those plans after all, ok guys lets go home""Besides directly making all of the above completely irrelevant, what happens in this new Disney Star Wars universe if a pilot falls asleep on the wheel and accidentally hyperspace rams a planet? What if he was checking his Twitter while piloting? or a disgruntled former employee? A terrorist?Speaking of the Death Stars too, why build such an expensive space station when you can just strap on a hyperdrive to random asteroid and hyperspace it into a planet? Much more cost effective and same exact effect, no?Finally, why did ""Admiral"" Holdo wait until the very LAST REBEL ship to hyperspace ram the Capital ship of the New Order? She sacrificed like, what, a dozen Rebel ships before she apparently came up with that brilliant idea? I'm guessing the purple hair dye seeped into her brain, or maybe it was just the patriarchy holding her down. Who knows?5) Luke Skywalker. Now here is a man, who, at the tender young age of his early 20s, was plucked out of obscurity from a remote desert planet, and, despite everyone and their mothers telling him otherwise, decides that Darth Vader, the notorious mass murderer and the Emperor's right hand man, had some good in him, and he bravely went and confronted him not once, but TWICE. Where is this hero? Apparently broken and defeated because a barrel chested angsty teenager got a little mad at him, forcing him to abandon his friends, family, and all he has ever fought for and sulk like a coward milking some kind of space cows. Fruthermore, whats the point of the ghost projection at the end if he was going to die anyways? Why not go there as a man worthy of the Luke Skywalker legend? I have no problem with characters changing, thats fine. Its how the story teller TAKES that character there is what counts. To take someone like Luke and have him turn into a sulking coward, you have to EARN the right to that to him by exceptional story telling. 6) Rey ""Mary Sue"". Please keep in mind that in the in-universe timeline, Mary Sue was, at best, a week removed from her escape from Jakku. In that short amount of time, somehow she manages to 1) defeat Luke skywalker in an impromptu melee, 2) Defeat Snoke's Elite bodyguards in a grossly over matched setting, 3) use the Force competently enough to defeat Kylo Ren, who has presumably been training since childhood, 4) and outfly trained TIE Fighter pilots, among many other super human feats. 5) Know how to swim.... after living her entire life on a desert planet. Anakin Skywalker, who was ""too old"" at 9 years old to even begin training, must be jealous. Luke, the son of the prodigal Anakin Skywalker, had to struggle to even move a lightsaber and spent months on a swamp planet with a dyslexic talking frog just to learn the basics of the Force, and got his hand chopped off for his efforts.7) The entire plot revolves around the FO fleet slowwwwly crawl up to the escaping Resistance fleet. First of all, why does light (laser beams) ""lose power"" over the distance of a few kilometers in vacuum? And since when do Star Wars ships ""use fuel"" when in the still canonical cross section books even the oldest Republic Era capital ships were powered by ""massive fusion generators that generate more power than a star""? Just to serve a contrived and boring plot point and give a movie something to make it last 2 hours? Did the Death Star have to stop by a gigantic Chevron gas station in space on its way to blow up Alderaan? Hopefully Tarkin let the Stormtroopers use the bathrooms and grab some snacks real quick. Is Pablo Hidalgo still around to make sure consistency in the SW canon is maintained? Or is it now the ""Kathleen Kennedy **** show""?8) The entire Resistance is apparently comprised of a few hundred people. For an entire galaxy of quintillion beings. Apparently the Resistance capital ships have a population density less than that of your average crack house. Just how 12 is Rian Johnson exactly? And why is the only way to send a message to their allies on that old Rebel base? no one has an iphone? They managed to contact Maz just fine before.8 ) Snoke.... why kill off the single most interesting new bad guy? Space Leia... why? The third leg on those Rebel speeds on the planet Crayt that create a very visually distinct red trail easily trackable by the enemy....why? The resistance keeping the base door open until the last second causing needless casualties....why? How did that Code breaker even know of the Rebel plans? Finn and Rose left before anyone even knew what the plans even were. Who told him? Who told Finn/ Rose? Speaking of the Dynamic Diversity Duo, how did they manage to make it back to the Rebel base on Crayt so quickly, without getting shot at by the AT-AT walkers, once their speeders crashed? DOES THIS MOVIE EVEN STAY CONSISTENT TO ITS OWN SELF?The entire existence of this movie, which removed any and all interesting characters and mysteries (Snoke, Reys parents, Luke, etc) introduced in Force Awakens. Why? What about the Knights of Ren, CLEARLY shown in the Force Awakens as being part of the destruction of Lukes Jedi Academy? The level of carelessness in constructing a coherent, consistent trilogy is astounding. I would not be surprised in the slightest if I found out Rian Johnson never even watched the Force Awakens, or at best was given a rough outline of what happened in it.In short.... congratulations Universe. You win again.Not just the worst Star Wars movie ever, but honestly just one of the worst movies in general.Rian Johnson is just an edgy douche bag who clearly enjoys taking what he knows people like and expect and just going the complete opposite way just to be a contrarian jack ass, If that's all Disney wanted they could have just made Luke Skywalker be the leader of a group of space faring Force using Unicorns who are the reincarnated Jedi masters of the past and shoot lasers out of their horns. Even less people would have expected that so it HAS to be good, right?Kathleen Kennedy is a well know hardcore feminist idiot. Now that old white dude Lucas is not the boss anymore, Kathleen is having a field day shoving her toxic neo-feminist garbage down our throats.Please don't support this film. Don't support Disney. They are the epitome of a soulless corporation that specializes in mass producing generic, unimaginative digital content and overcrowded, overpriced theme parts. They need to learn their lesson and not be the arrogant corporation they are, and go back to their roots. RT is not calculating the REAL scores of this film correctly. Its audience approval is WAY less than 49%, and the fake ""five star"" reviews are barely one or two sentences long. All the professional critics paid off or intimated by Disney are now exposed and will lose a TON of credibility in their future reviews.This is just a MESS. It takes a special kind of idiot to be able to ruin an established franchise like Star Wars in such a way, and Rian Johnson is exactly that idiot.",The Last Jedi,287

A lack luster attempt at connecting with the five women as each of their stories are revealed, comes out short and unconvincingly. The last 1/4 had some cool visuals ( two stars simply for them) but no ambiguity as to what was what at the end, nothing to discuss except why did I fall for the critics reviews when I know better than to do that. As it stands, the end was a major fail unless you weren't paying attention. Rodriguez should have have chosen something better to lose her virginity moving to the big screen with. Portman who always does well even when the script is lacking, seems very disconnected. The biggest issue for me is that it could have been the movie the critics think they saw , done differently , more thought, better dialogue , an end that made sense by what came before it. Instead it's a cheaply thrown together ho hum that ' could have been a contender' , so to speak.",Annihilation,4689

negative,"  Oh, Dear..where to start... This is one of the most uninspired, utterly boring, slower than a turtle's crawl, stale, unimaginative, thought- not-provoking movie I have ever witnessed . Although most of the critics and the self-proclaimed ""deep thinkers"" giving this movie 5 stars would make you believe, this movie is a gloomy pile of self-pitty, stupidity, and nonsense designed for deeply depressed people who find joy in observing other equally depressed individuals portrayed on the big screen. And yes, some of you are right in stating that this movie is not for the mass audiences who would not be able to comprehend its illogical and pointless plot..It is made for those rare individuals with below average intelligence who are actually unable to think and ask questions but rather are willing to accept a few scientific words and conceptions thrown at them, a few weird scenes with creepy creatures and a few wooden characters at face value precisely because they do not understand anything that's going on but desperately want to fit with the smarter crowd. So lets examine the so called ""brilliant premises"" of the movie which seem to grasp the attention of the ""deep thinkers"". The idea of self destruction was introduced in the movie, as the psychologist said ""we all drink and smoke""...WOW self-destructing ourselves must be the idea of the century for these poor souls. What incredible imagination!!! Next is the scientific notion about programmed cell death- WOW has anyone heard about apoptosis, or the programmed cell death before? Obviously the intelligent ""deep thinkers"" haven't? What about Freud;s death instinct? Nope, never heard of it- go check it on google ""deep thinkers"". Actually the only interesting notion in the movie was the idea that cell were initially created to divide perpetually and they eventually stop dividing due to a faulty gene( not a new idea but interesting). Now let's talk about how slow paced and infuriatingly one toned this movie is. I don't know about you ""deep thinkers"" maybe you need more time to process things but I personally prefer when someone is talking to me to not pause for 1 minute between sentences and stare at me for another minute before he continues with the next torturous sentence. Yea, believe it or not I am that fast thinking, I can comprehend a whole speech without 1 minute pauses between each sentence. The sound, music and CGI effects are equally terrible - if want to imagine how the Shimmer looks, just go to the park, blow a soap bubble and Voila you will see the Shimmer through it.Now let's get down to the plot. There is this phenomenon happening at a local park that keeps enlarging and engulfing more territory. The government has sent multiple expeditions and drones but nobody comes back except one soldier who happens to be Natalie Portman's husband. He comes back to the house after 12 months absence, acting weird and out of character, then he starts throwing up blood. Natalie takes him to the hospital and they get ambushed by some special forces. Basically Natalie who is a professor of cellular biology wakes up and finds out about the Shimmer so she decides to join a team of psychologist, paramedic, physicist and another person to explore the Shimmer. Why would they go in after so many have failed without any clear plan of what they are going to do is mind-blowing on its own. But hey, let's not get to picky and try to find a reason or a plot in this mindless endeavor. So they go in and wake up with amnesia which seems to last only for the first few days, after that they remember everything even enough to recount the events when the last survivor Natalie comes out of the Shimmer. So the physicist gets pulled by a giant alligator into the water and stays there for s couple of minutes but comes out ...wait for it miraculously without a scratch. How is that possible when she should have come out without half her limbs you ask yourself- well let the ""deep thinkers"" figure it out, I am sure they will come up with something. So the big idea is that when you get into the Shimmer the thing/alien creature deconstructs your DNA - how exactly deconstructs it , is their a pattern, how does it choose to turn some people into glooming trees and blow up deconstruct others to their basic molecules(the psychologist's fate) is not explained or reasoned with at all. But, hey let's not forget this movie is not made for people who want to know, it is made for these rare ""deep thinkers"" who don't need to know or find reason or logic - like people on crack. So, one by one the explorers all get killed except Natalie who gets to the light house (the supposed home of the creature). By a drop of her blood the alien recreates this silver human looking being who starts to copy Natalie's every move. So, we watch her slow dance with this creature for a bit without any attempt on her part to understand it or try to talk to it, find its reasons for being on Earth..I mean didn't she just go in their to find out what is going on??? Instead she decides to give the alien a bomb and for another unknown reason the alien decided to pull the trigger and blow him/herself. Great ending right? When Natalie is questioned by the government people what did the creature want she says after a good minute or two of staring and thinking ""I don't know"".. Right, then why did you go in in the first place, dear? What the alien deconstructed your DNA and thinking to such a degree that it made you lose all purpose...And of course the end is mind blowing- the shimmer is gone, but now Natalie and her husband Kane (who is not her real husband any more but the alien) are possessed. Wow what a brilliant end for the ""deep thinkers"" For the rest of us intelligent people with sense of logic this movie is pure nonsensical trash, and uninspired at that.",Annihilation,4674

Entire movie is literally shots of some groups of men of random racial attunement, mixed up with attempts of our brave soldier Jane, the only somewhat redeemable character in the flick, to outplay them. The plot is beyond atrocious; nothing bad guys ever do makes sense. Same goes for acting.

I am not sure where or how any decent ratings are coming from. Everyone in the theater also was baffled, confused, laughing at the film (not the funny parts) and disoriented. The film had no purpose, an resolved nothing. It was complete garbage and the ending was so predictable. Again, I repeat. This is by far, the worst movie I have ever seen. I cannot think of another movie that was worse than this. I think people feel they ""have"" to like it, or that it is more complex than it is. To not like it would mean they are stupid.

negative,"  One of the most disappointing experiences I have had in a long time, and by far the worst one in the Star Wars universe. Visually, it was pretty, and well designed, except for the moronic bombers and ""speeders"" They simply make zero sense in a sci fi context. The tempo was completely off, right from the very beginning when the first order is portrayed as buffons rather than establishing credibility as the ""big bad"" This destroyed immersion for me right from the getgo, and the incoherent scripting was never able to regain suspension of disbelief. Jokes are fine and great, but should be used to break continued, high levels of tension, here, they opened with jokes that failed to land, and never managed to establish tension. The story ""progressed"" with leaders scapegoating in order to emasculate Poe, and show ""powerful"" characters by tearing other characters down to show their superior value. All this comes free, with a plot so disturbingly full of holes it appears to be a paper researched and written the night before it was due. This plot disrespects physics, and especially logical thought and intelligent tactics so much that it was not possible for me to get into the film.Suspension of disbelief is critical for getting moviegoers to overlook or forgive technical oversights.. but film never came close to establishing enough credibility, and has a HUGE number of logic failures that require forgiving. Overall.. it was pretty.. but the writing was horrific, and kept delivering one insult after another. The story was never gripping, tense, nor entertaining, leaving my most frequent thought during the film as ""are you f*$#@ng kidding me?""",The Last Jedi,939

They skipped over so much (I'm sure it made a lot more sense to people who read the book) and didn't take much time for character development so, as a first time viewer, I didn't much care about the characters which meant I lost interest in the storyline. I felt the film was underdevelopand rushed the story and, if I'm being honest, the acting was the worst part.

Look no further than the Wizard of Oz as an example of great adaptation in the same vein as Wrinkle in Time. WoZ involves a young girl on a journey, a fantasy world, with munchkins , talking trees, good and bad witches, a yellow brick road, a mission, several and a yearning to return home. It has strong characters, a clear story, a pivotal crisis, and an ending. Its special effects are limited to a spinning house and a melting witch. So, my thoughts: cut the special effects gimmicks, return to a simple framework: key characters, key moments, key emotions, and tell the story with the strong voice of a little girl who is a torrent of emotion and who with the help of a classic trio: three wonderful witches, courageously acts in the face of fear.Good try, but really.....",A Wrinkle in Time,3149

Visually recreating faithfully the atmosphere of the late 1950s-early 1960s, del Toro mixes the 1950s B movie monster genre with magic realism. The result is not a success.

I like Harry Potter movies but this particular movie made no sense to me. I think there was some sort of well meaning message. I'm sure the book is way better the problem is trying to condense it in a 109 minute film leaving some vital details out on how their universe works.

Okay, I have no problem with putting a message in a film so long as the movie is entertaining and watchable. While sets, music, costumes and acting were good, Del Toro usually does a better job of story-telling. So much was predictable with this film and so much is wrong! Del Toro takes many swipes at the ""bad guys"" but delivers no knock out punch as this film just doesn't work. Again Del Torno makes the man in unifom the bad guy. Forget what such people did in two world wars to protect the rest of civilization and keep totlitarianism away, Hollywood is so busy trashing ""old ways"" they neglect the real monsters circling outside the walls. Del Toro takes a Lovecraftain Dagon monster and recasts him as something loveable but the romance is built up with little substance (or even emotion) behind it. The two ""oppressed lovers"" go though an adventure that will likely please malcontents everywhere but the story is too weak to truly make it enjoyable.

negative,"  Peter RabbitInitial Reaction: How many Peter Rabbits are there out there?Main Characters Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny: Two rabbits voiced by James Corden and Colin Moody. Bea: She's the next door neighbor. She 's played by Rose Byrne.Plot Summary Peter, his family, and his animal friends are doing their usual routine: Get into McGregor's farm and get as many vegetables as possible. But after a certain rain goes wrong, Peter gets caught by McGregor. But the old guy suffers a fatal heart attack and is whisked away. The animals think they've got their problems solved and have run of the place. However, a distant relative shows up several days later to fix up the place. The new guy, Thomas, turns out to be just as protective as the other McGregor - which really angers Peter Rabbit. However, Thomas' plans take hit a bump when he and Bea take a liking to each other. This makes Peter want Thomas out of the house even more.SCORINGMain Characters Peter and Thomas have some great moments near the end of the film, but there's not much to like about either one of them.  And I don't really like Bea because she's stuck in the typical ""girlfriend/peacekeeper"" character. SCORE: 6Supporting Cast The rest of the animals are okay, but not memorable. There's a hedgehog who acts like and elderly woman, several rabbit sisters arguing who's the oldest and the Peter's best friend who goes anywhere just to help him out. SCORE: 5Plot The film goes a bit overboard with the revenge plot between Peter and Thomas. Then it tries to resolve the problem in a way that's really short and ridiculous. SCORE: 4Originality It's your average family film - with talking animals. Wait, that still makes it your average family film. SCORE: 5Violence Factor A lot of bad things happen to Thomas - he gets electrocuted, has bear traps clamp onto his hands, suffers from huge falls, and so on. And yet, he's not hurt at all. Ridiculous. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film tries to show what happens when a small conflict gets out of control, but the way that conflict is resolved is a bit too fast and tidy.  And they fudge the rule about the animals and humans talking to one another. In several scenes, they can't do that but in a key scene, a human is having a normal conversation with an animal. SCORE: 5Final Score (out of 60): 29 % Score: 48.33% Peter and Thomas needed to be less of jerks then they are, and the main conflict needed to have a better resolution.",Peter Rabbit,8075

Even ignoring trailers and videos, I was disappointed, and not satisfied with the bland, obvious political/social commentary in the film. Clearly just a product designed to cash in on audiences. The action lacked suspense and thrill, and the skill of T'Challa was incredibly inconsistent. The suit provides a complete crutch, and there's no suspense as long as he's wearing it, because kinetic energy (ie. bullets, attacks etc.) just increases his strength. The comedy falls completely flat, and is incredibly distracting from the overall image the movie tries to make.

negative,"  Pro: Incredible art and visual effectsCons: Weak, clunky story, poor chemistry between Rose and Finn, and enough plot holes to fly a Mandator IV Siege Dreadnought through.Overall the movie gets a 'Meh' rating from me. It does not lend itself well to the Space Opera feel that Star Wars trilogies are famous for. Don't blame any of the actors and actresses in the least, they did the best they could with the garbage that Rian Johnson gave them. Btw, this opinion is held by my sister, a transwoman lesbian liberal, so no it wasn't catering to SJW. We also both agree that there is absolutely no way that Rey would not have fallen to the Dark Side, being raised as practically a slave, treated like garbage worse than Anakin was in the Phantom Menace, had 'friends' that betrayed her in that novel about three of the main characters. We both thought it would have been far more interesting an ending had she actually joined Kylo and a major twist no one at all would have expected.What Rian Johnson should be credited for is creating the dumbest female character in the entire Star Wars franchise (both cannon and Legends). I speak of course of Admiral Holdo, for if she just told SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMAND STAFF of the ship she just switched her flag to (Poe Dameron most specifically) what the plan was, Poe wouldn't have gotten Finn and Rose off the ship to find a slicer (Legends term for hacker) that eventually betrays them for money, caused the death of dozens if not hundreds of members of the Resistance.",The Last Jedi,620

This does not necessarily mean it's bad, however I dont believe that something needs to be changed wl unless you're going to do it better than the originals.I felt the movie never struck the right balance between silly in a childish way, action and excitement. The pacing was frankly kind of weird (see the addition of fuel into the saga so they could have a very slow chase), during which Poe and Rose go to a casino planet so they can deepen their relationship from non-existant to two dimensional while tacking in some pretty hollow moral values.The Luke character come out of retirement to drink some bird milk (seriously) and anguish over some pretty weak moral dilemmas. I wish i could give it credit for a fresh and invigorating take on the existing series but the storyline was weak, the plot devices contrived and the acting was frankly not as good as 7, which I'll put back into the poor dialogue and almost slap stick level of childish comedy.Overall a very poor movie.",The Last Jedi,309

negative,"  Putting aside whether there is any demand or need to reboot the Tomb Raider franchise (the answer is probably no, by the way), this is a very pedestrian production hampered by a predictable and unimaginative script, and this is despite a wasted Alicia Vikander who has presence and does her best with the materials she is given. The only thing I can say in its favour are a few set action sequences which are decently mounted - the bike chase and the rusty jet carcass over a waterfall scenes are nicely done and provide a few thrills in an otherwise dull and unimpressive film in which characters bumbles from one perilous situation into another with little preparation or skills that make any logical sense. Out of the two so-called 'twists' in the script, one is so obvious I don't think even the most naÔve of audience will be shocked by it and the other is just so random, it's laughable and is optimistically put there just to set up future sequels. A British supporting cast comprising of Dominic West, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Derek Jacobi looks awkward as if they are slightly ashamed about picking up their paychecks and by the time the film reaches its final act, I honestly believe that the only tomb they've raided is that of Indiana Jones's as it turns into a shamefully sub-standard rip off of the Raiders of the Lost Ark.",Tomb Raider,9670

negative,"  Quick review of Tomb Raider: A mishmash of action cliches and cheap jump scares that do not do the franchise any justice. Try to remember the cliches found in 2012 (2009 with John Cusack) where the protagonist was on the verge of collapse, only to be saved by deus ex machina. Have that image in your mind? Now rinse and repeat for virtually every action sequence in the 2 hour time span and you've summarized the ""action"" portion of this film. Alicia Vikander was wonderful in Deus Ex Machina (2015) and entertaining in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015); however, her role fell short here. I felt that the role of Lara Croft will be attempted by many female actresses and much like the role of James Bond, each individual should add a unique twist on that role - a signature, if you will. Such a signature would separate that actor's contributions from past iterations. Unfortunately, Vikander added little to separate her from Angelina Jolie's sultry and seductive take on a then-sexualized role. Granted, it could be argued that the role wasn't designed for a lot of emotional development, but Jolie still brought a sense of emotional attachment to her father in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). This degree of depth and even the dilemma, upon further reflection, was copied in all-to-similar fashion in this rendition. Dominic West performed well and it is a shame his personal demons were not given more screen time. This leaves us with a conclusion: this movie, as a reboot, works as a copy to the original. If you want a more humanized Lara Croft in a predictable screenplay, this may work for you. If you are looking for something new, look else. 2 Jumping Mummies out of 5.",Tomb Raider,9775

Movie lacks character devolpment and doesn't explain over half of itself (at one point they mention ludus, the world of schools in the book, but never showed nor mentioned it at all before then on the movie). I takes out interesting referances (supiadaman, ultraman [though ownership confusion was the meaning for that], many, many obscure arcade games, the interesting ending to the hunt [replaced with just playing atari]) for boring, common ones (the shining, overwatch, akira, iron giant). The ending felt uneventful and rushed, and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I will say the visuals (though sometimes in the uncanny valley) were interesting and fun.

negative,"  Ready Player One is a movie about a dystopian future where mankind as a whole has stop trying to solve their real life problems and instead tries to runaway their problem by escaping into a Virtual World call Oasis. I did not enjoy the movie at all because I find the movie to be predictable, boring and none of the characters and entities within the movie are likable or admirable in anyway. The game that the movie revolves around, Oasis, as far as i can tell is a game that is built based on the freeprium or ""pay to win model"" where players can either spend a large amount of time in game to earn virtual currencies in order to buy upgrades or can pay real world money to buy in game upgrades that allows them to get a competitive edge against other players. Players can then compete for relics which then they can resell for large amount of ingame virtual currency which in turn they can use to buy virtual or real world gaming items. Within the movie it seems like it is quite routine for consumers to over stretch their budget in order to buy virtual upgrades that they hope will allow them to win one of these ""relics"". The main character's uncle is one such person who spent their families saving only to lose everything when his virtual character is killed with in the game. As such I have difficulty characterizing the company that made and maintains Oasis as anything other than an evil corporation. While the movie portrayed Nolan Sorrento as the villain of the movie, I personally think the true villain is the creator of Oasis James Halliday. James Halliday is a someone with a god complex who is incapable developing any kind of real connection with his fellow human beings. When told that he need to take responsibility for the unintended negative impact that Oasis has had on mankind, instead of making the necessary changes to Oasis, instead he decided to force out his partner and allow mankind to continue to to fall into the state of disarray. To accelerate the process of decay and get more people to get addicted to his game, upon his death, he created a competition for all Oasis player to search for three keys. The ones who managed to win all three keys inherits all of his fortune which in the movie is said to be about half a trillion dollars. The key to winning all of the competition is not about being smart, or kind, or brave, but rather based on how much you know about the creator of the game. As such the creator create an incentive for the world to essentially study and learn about every facet of his life including his likes and dislikes. By creating the competition he essentially elevated himself into a king or god like status reminiscent of how people in the past would study Mao, Stalin or Hitler. He also incentivizes all the people in the world to invest all their time and energy into playing the game rather than to solve real world problems. While Nolan Sorrento might be responsible for the suffering of thousands and 10s of thousands, James Halliday is responsible for the downfall of the human civilization. The protagonist of the movie is a young adult 18 years old who as far as i can tell doesn't go to school, doesn't go to work, has common sense of a child when it comes to online safety and spends all of his time playing the Oasis game. The protagonist's ability to associate with real people is so poor that he seems to be more concerned about the future of the Oasis game itself than the fact that the evil IOI corporation killed his aunt, uncle and neighbors. In the end the I find protagonist to be extremely unlikable due to the fact that reminds me of someone who is looking for a short cut through life (in his case beating a video game) rather than someone who tries to put together a plan and grind it out in the real world through honest work. Storyline was paper thin and extremely predictable. The world that is created by the movie is incredibly depressing and none of the characters are really likable. Even after the near 3 hour movie, neither the world nor protagonist went through any kind of transformation for the better and instead the protagonist was handsomely rewarded despite his naivety and poor decisions in life and god knows how many people's life savings were completely wiped out due the event of the movie.",Ready Player One,1362

negative,"  Remember when alien movies were just about little green men or robot humanoids coming to conquer Earth? Annihilation is another in a long line of modern sci-fi films to be more interested in the philosophy than the practicality of extra-terrestrials. But unlike Under the Skin or Europa Report, its ponderous nature never quite reaches its point. It's definitely a metaphor for something, but what? Aging? Marriage? Dementia? Time? Death? Perhaps a second-viewing would clear some of this up, but then I'd have to slog through this movie again.An unknown object has crashed onto earth, causing a slowly growing ""shimmer"" wall that seems to make anyone who enters it disappear. In so many ways, it's just a lesser version of classic films. Like Tarkovsky's Stalker, it's comfortable with saying ""I don't know"", but more out of confusion than intrigue. Like Villeneuve's Arrival, it uses alien beings to talk about humanity, but with little emotional impact. Like Carpenters' The Thing, its unexpectedly and brutally gory, though not as technically impressive.However, it's a hard movie to write-off or be complacent about, given its strangeness and ambition. The bursts of horror are fun and unique, with cool creatures and a steady directing hand. Most of all, it's visually striking cinematography and often quite beautiful production design are undeniable. Most of its issues seem to stem from the writing, which isn't just thematically unfocused, but also just full of cliched dialogue. With Ex Machina, Alex Garland made a strong impression with that debut. And even with all of Annihilation's script problems, his camera's eye and brainy tendencies keep him as a filmmaker worth watching.",Annihilation,4643

Kylo REn pretty much sums up what Rian Johnson has done when he makes the statement ""Kill the past"" You can make good Star Wars movies without destroying what people already know and love. I wont even get into the fact that Rey is a Mary Sue. THat Leia is superman. Or any of the SJW stuff that was throughout this film.

negative,"  Sherlock Gnomes is a frequently clever animated film that has a few fun moments, yet suffers from a jumbled story and too many characters to fully engage you in the movie as a whole.Sherlock Gnomes is a sequel to Gnomeo and Juliet and brings together garden gnome versions of the famous detective and the Shakespearean couple from the first installment. Gnomeo and Juliet move to a new garden in London that disappoints their entire faction of gnomes. Gnomeo and Juliet are appointed the new leaders to turn the garden into a beautiful wonderland for their little village. Meanwhile, several gardens have been erased of all signs of gnomekind and soon, Gnomeo and Juliet's is too. The dynamic duo of the incredibly smart, but sometimes selfish detective and protector of London's garden gnomes Sherlock Gnomes and his trusty sidekick Watson are on the case and intend to catch the culprit and track down the missing gnomes, with the help of Gnomeo and Juliet.Unfortunately the collision of these literary duos doesn't work very well. Their stories have very different characters and tones. The film makes clever references to Sherlock Holmes and his works that will be enjoyable for fans of the character's inspiration, but the collaboration still feels forced. Gnomeo and Juliet go through a storyline that feels out of place and their conversations have a repetitive message. The characters feel less developed against the more engaging Sherlock. Gnomes.My favorite character is Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp). He embodies the qualities of the literary detective and makes his portrayal of Sherlock his own, giving him a more fun and comedic manner. He also nails Sherlock's complex relationship with Watson.I recommend this film for ages 5 to 9 due to some crude humor. Younger kids will enjoy the film's bright colors and caper elements and older kids and adults might enjoy some of the humor. However, this film lacks the vivid animation and nuance that offers the same wide appeal of other animated films. I give it 2.5 out of 5 stars because the story is a bit confusing, although it has some characters and good laughs. Reviewed by bENJAMIN p. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

negative,"  Sherlock GnomesInitial Reaction: Gee, wonder who's going to show up in this film.Main Characters Sherlock Gnomes: He's Sherlock Holmes if he was a gnome. He's voiced by Johnny Depp Dr. Watson: Sherlock's faithful assistant. He's voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor Gnomeo, Juliet: Two lawn gnomes voiced by James McAvoy and Emily Blunt.Plot Summary A crime wave has hit across a neighborhood in London. Every single lawn gnome has vanished and there's one guy made for the job: Sherlock Gnomes. He and Dr. Watson have to follow the clues left behind by the culprit to find out where the lawn gnomes are. And they are going to get help from Gnomeo and Juliet - no matter if they want the help or not.SCORINGMain Characters They do a good job of showing Sherlock as the arrogant, egotistical know it all. And I also liked Watson as the quiet assistant who does what he's told. But Gnomeo and Juliet are really bland in this film. You could've substituted any two other gnomes and have gotten the same result. SCORE: 5Supporting Cast The rest of the lawn gnomes aren't really memorable - but they're not as bad as Moriarty. Sherlock's nemesis is portrayed as a creepy cute human kid (at least that's what I think he is). I really didn't like that. The master criminal deserved a lot better than this. SCORE: 2Plot The main plot goes about the standard business of following the clues - but the scenes don't really add up to anything special - except for the big reveal near the end of the film. SCORE: 4Originality This film is your standard mystery film. Making almost everyone a lawn gnome just doesn't do much for the story. SCORE: 4Violence Factor Not a lot - except for the many, many times a gnome is threatened to get smashed. Other than that, the confrontations between Sherlock and Moriarty have very little pop in them. SCORE: 4Other Moral Issues This film has a romantic pairing between a frog and a lawn gnome - which just feels wrong.  Besides, there are times when Sherlock should be more through than he is in this film. He makes a few really bad mistakes that no other Sherlock would make. SCORE: 3Final Score (out of 60): 22 % Score: 36.67%Here's an idea - have an original story with the lawn gnomes instead of adapting some other person's work.",Sherlock Gnomes,8149

By the way, the villain is just a miserable try to make a version of the joker in The Lego Batman Movie.The most infuriating thing is that the movie tries to make you feel it's smart; showing 2D animated scenes to display the way Sherlock Gnomes thinks or how he tries to solve the mystery and all that absolutely nonsensical. Also, there is a plot twist that is presumed to be surprising.there are man many other problem but let's get over them and mention the very few things that I liked in this movie:- The animation quality is surprisingly quite good.- James McAvoy's and Johnny Depp's voice acting are the only two that are kinda good but the other actors aren't good (Emily Blunt's voice acting is very idle)- The first 20 minutes are fast paced so I think this is a bonus!

negative,"  Simply put, don't go see this movie, don't watch it, don't buy it, don't give them your money. This was a horrible movie. I had hopes that they wouldn't screw it up, but they did. I left disappointed, I felt cheated and I didn't even want to watch Star Wars anymore, and I have loved this franchise since I was a kid. They completely destroyed the character of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil was in his right to say that he fundamentally disagreed with everything they've decided to do with his character, because Luke is no longer a likable character). I had hoped to see a wise, old, and powerful Luke pulling of force abilities and saber combat that would've rivaled Yoda or Mace Windu. But, nope, they decided to make him a despicable character who barely uses the force, gives bad advice, refuses to teach Rey anything, and wants to rid the universe of the Jedi. The one cool battle scene with him ended up being a trick and he barely did anything (though the force ability he used was cool) then he dies for no apparent reason whatsoever. Rey is still good at everything with no training for nor reason and despite the fact that she is a nobody (yeah, another horrible surprise, her parents were basically the nobodies of nobodies). Her character doesn't progress at all, because she's already good at everything despite not knowing anything. Finn is still a main character for some reason and has a whole side story that turns out to be pointless and he probably should've died. Poe is a good character, until he is demoted and put in his place for no reason other than he didn't trust command because they're plan was stupid and purple hair lady didn't want to tell him anything. The asian girl who is introduced and made a main character for no reason is stupid and does nothing to the story other than give Finn a love interest and create completely unnecessary subplot. Adam Driver does a good job with Kylo, but the writers did a horrible job with the character. He is still unintimadating (I didn't think his character was anywhere near scary in 7 either, definitely not a new Vader) and is kind of stupid and changes emotions every scene. Snoke is shown to be super powerful in an awesome scene, until he is immediately killed by Kylo with a cheap trick that Sidious would've seen through easily. We learn nothing about Snoke so turns out he is another pointless character. Leia uses the force in a laughable scene that was supposed to be serious (apparently multiple theaters reported the audience burst out laughing) and probably should've been killed off. Phasma did nothing and was pointless (a common theme in this movie). Most of this movie would've been forgettable if it didn't piss me off so much because they ruined one of the greatest things ever produced. I'm pretty sure Rain Johnson heard that it was impossible to ruin Star Wars and make the new films worse than the prequels and decided to prove everyone wrong. I wish this movie (and probably The Force Awakens, though I liked that one more) should be wiped from canon and they should remake it. I don't want to watch any future Star Wars films after this one. I no longer plan on seeing Episode 9 or the Han Solo movie because I refuse to give money to these idiots who are ruing one of my favorite franchises of all time. DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.",The Last Jedi,767

negative,"  Slow, lazy, boring and pretentious.Essentially this movie is about going from point A to point B, with dropping of backpacks whenever possible. Occasional events that happen during journey do not contribute to story in any way. As result both story and its conclusion are exceptionally boring and confusing(mild leanings into supernatural, instead of completely plausible scientific explanations, do not help either), as practically nothing relevant have any explanation or even hint at explanation. Few short scenes that give glimpses into events that happen in the Shimmer are not unpacked in any way and serve more as a filler. Only meaningful conversation that even attempts to explain Shimmer lasts about 2 minutes. Rest of them are either recollections of past life or are pointless banter. Neither have nay relevance to story.Annihilation is so open-minded that viewer mind simply shuts down at some point as there is no pieces to connect together. Every time some pattern starts to emerge whole thing takes 180 and goes in completely different direction. Ending is completely disconnected from rest of the movie and as result do not make any sense. If there was some grand idea behind this film, then i fail to see it, even glimpse of it. Its just lazy, relaying on viewer imagination to fill all those huge plot and logic holes in non-existing storyline.After watching thru it 3 times, in attempt to find some hidden meaning, initial reaction of ""What was the point of all this ?"", be it bone jigsaw in front of lighthouse or memory card at old base, did not really change in the slightest.

But then everything just went crazy and the story fell apart into the complete ridiculous. In the midst of the madness though, the 'twist' ending did somehow manage to still be completely predictable. The most frustrating thing for me however was that to me a lot of the bulk of the story could have had scientific basis, (aside from the ending) but the explanations given are completely ridiculous and beyond any realm of possibility. Sci fi needs to have science, and just because this movie features scientists who use the right buzz words, does not ground the plot in any actual science.

negative,"  So sad. I viewed this movie twice in the theater. Visually, it was beautiful, and had some fun sequences, but as a Star Wars film, it was so weak. J.J. set things up fairly well with The Force Awakens, only for Johnson to throw it all away to castrate the male characters, particularly Skywalker, while at the same time pushing these ""flawless"" female characters up to the fore to be politically correct. Rey is the same clueless girl we got in the Force Awakens with little development to her character. Finn had more development, willing to sacrifice himself for a cause he believes in, only to have some mechanic whose only purpose is to spout off some political message jump in and stop him. Poe is shown to be a complete over the top hot head here, which isn't a bad idea in and of itself, but the entire idea of withholding the escape plan was just unnecessary. Kylo still isn't an intimidating villain, and Snoke's death had no real weight to it. And finally, Luke Skywalker's character was just...disappointing. Mark Hamill delivered a good performance for what he had to work with, but considering murdering his own nephew after he had redeemed his father who had done countless terrible acts years before was just a joke. Lucasfilm needs to be brought under better management. They need a president who actually understands the franchise that is being worked on, rather than gearing everything toward targeting a demographic that was never really intended to be the sole focus of the series. There were always strong female characters in the series and in the other related media. Unless Lucasfilm changes management and gets a grip on things, you'd be better off enjoying the Lucas era Star Wars, and some of the books and comics from that period.",The Last Jedi,400
negative,"  So so so awful. instead of doing something in the vain of Resident Evil, they tried to do something similar in tone to Arrival, but with horrible art direction, flat performances, no chemistry with the lead actors, and a complete lack of engaging sound design or music, unless you count the last 10 minutes which was too little too late.

Rey and Kylo were utilized well. The acting, overall was good.

The entire plot is obvious from the movie poster, and the gratuitous sexual scenes take away more than they help the main story.Admittedly there is a high level of discipline demonstrated in creating a consistent aesthetic in the production, but outside of that almost black and white old time-y vibe, I almost found nothing in this movie enjoyable. The amphibian man is far too simple to care strongly for, the protagonist is so relentlessly driven and fearless that she comes off as childish. The main supporting role of her friend is fairly likable, but everyone else is at best a mixed case.

negative,"  SPOILER FILLED REVIEWFinally saw The Last Jedi and it's ok, but in no shape or form second best after TESB. What I liked most was the character development of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, very well build up as the main proponent of the dark side, no second Vader but he doesn't need to be, actually a much more complex and interesting character.The battle scenes were impressive and the movie looks and sounds beautiful.There's a few funny moments that work well, not the Porgs though, what do these anoying penguins in a star wars movie, they didn';t learn their lesson from Jar Jar Binks.Carrie Fisher was great, even though the space scene was utterly ridiculous. The reunion with Luke was very well handled even though he turned out to be a bloody hologram, jeez.I loved the reunion of Luke with Yoda, to me the most moving scene, quite magical.Ok, the gripes:- Luke was badly handled and I know it's a very subjective opinion, but on this topic it can't be anything else of course. I didn't want, what some fans seemed to be craving for, a reunion with Leia and Han and the old gang kicks ass one more time. That would have been stupid in my mind, but the way it eventually ended up being handled didn't feel right to me either.Of course the movie is about Luke/Rey (being the last Jedi) I excpected way more than the scenes they had together.Even though, if you think back, Luke's training by Yoda wasn't spend that much time on either, but somehow impacted you more, because Luke leaves, though before completing it, called away by the urge to save his friends. Rey leaves, because she has no time left to help her friends, but also because she is disappointed and failed by Luke, Big difference.Also a gripe that keeps resurfacing, the parallels with the original trilogy are becoming a bit annoying and to be honest, come accross as a bit lazy by the writers.Rey has become annoying and in no way captures your heart as Luke did in the original trilogy, sorry, she has a lot of spunk, but memorable she the character is not. Don't know why yet, but I think it's the writing not the actress.Still don't have a clue what Finn is good for in this story, baffles me how he keeps getting screentime even though the character is developing nowhere.Damon Poe has replaced him as the more fun rebel.Didn't like at all the send offs of two of the new villains Snoke as well as Captain Phasma, apart from the fact that nobody kicks Brienne of Tarth's ass, sorry Poe, they both deserved a way better ending, having been build up in part seven and then show them once and off they go?That;s crappy writing and no one will convince me otherwise and a shame because both had potential.Anyway, I am very glad there was a new Star Wars and well, since the old garde is now gone, I hope they will start truly taking the reigns of the franchise storywise and actually come up with someting new and not just a badly disguised rehash of the original trilogy.",The Last Jedi,658

negative,"  SPOILERS: A lot of plot holes, wasted opportunities, and character assassination of Luke's character. Rey is stronger than Luke with almost no training. Finn meets Rose and goes on a pointless mission. Leia floats through the vacuum of space and doesn't die, even though it would have made sense because Carrie Fisher (RIP) passed away during post-production. The Knights of Ren are gone and its never explained what happened to them. Are they Snoke's bodyguards? Who knows? Poe becomes a dumb stereotypical ""male rebel"" character. They never explain how Snoke brought Kylo to the dark side, didn't explain how Kylo killed Luke's students. Luke try's to kill Kylo or (Been Solo) in his sleep even though Luke almost died to prove that there was good in Darth Vader. Rey's parents are nobodies. Didn't explain how or why Rey hears voices from Obi-Wan and see's visions from Lukes 1st battle with Vader, in the Force Awakens when she touches Luke's Lightsaber. Luke sends a projection of himself to fight Kylo so the rebels can escape, but even though he just projects an image of himself he still dies? I could go on but these were the big ones. This movie disappointed a lot of fans. Also hated the fact that Finn is supposed to be an Important character for blacks (because I'm an African-American Male) and He is a useless character.

negative,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an insult to the series worse than the prequel trilogy. Just like its predecessor, it focuses on ""reimagining"" the story of the original, but does so in a worst way possible. The Last Jedi contains some of the most moronic scenes in the filming industry I've ever experienced. The way this Star Wars installment treats some of its characters is absolutely incomprehensible to me. How can you take such an iconic, relatable and badass character of all times and turn him into what you see in this movie - a failure? Explain that to me, if you can. Other characters are complete blank now. They have no motivation, no interesting stories to tell, and the worst offender is that they have no purpose to exist in this universe other then to create our so beloved forced diversity. Replace everyone in this film with only white male cast of movie veterans and nothing would change. They'd still be boring, moronic and have nothing to give, but at least there'd be some good performance. Not to say that the cast doesn't know, what they are doing, but they have absolutely nothing to work with. I guess that the writers were given a task like:""PC, feminist and SJW bs first; logic, sense and general storytelling are not important"". Why? Why would you do that? Star Wars was never about that, it was about adventure! And let me tell you, this smoking garbage hardly qualifies as one. It will take for a one hell of a ride.

Once you get rid of these effects and are left with the story, you might be disappointed. If you're a casual viewer, and barely know or care about the star wars lore, THIS IS FOR YOU! However, if you are an actual fan of the franchise and it's lore, you can not watch this movie, and not be disappointed. Before I watched the movie, I saw a lot of far left extremist media talk about ""Alt right"" bombing the film on here. I had a lot of good hopes for the movie, but in the end, I know it's not ""Alt right"" bombing the movie, it's far left people who have no idea of what star wars is, praising it.The big cliffhanger from the previous movie goes right off the cliff ""litteraly"" , and the big question of ""who reys parents are"" will feel you dissatisfied and insulted. What they did to Lea was insulting to the bone. However, there were great moments which I won't discuss here because I don't want to spoil it, but they felt not enough. In conclusion, this is in my opinion the most insulting star wars movie, but if you think about it as ""not really canon"" you still can have a lot of fun with it.",The Last Jedi,821

I enjoyed the references to the original game plus Murray (present) from Flight of the Conchords is in this film, what could go wrong. The movie does have a lot of CGI and i've become kind of desensitized to it. The acting is about what you'd expect from the cast. Hart and Black are the comedians and they're on their game for the most part there's not much from the other cast, aside from the Rock who I swear is typecast. The story is ok, and it reminded me a lot of Uncharted (the video game series on PS3 and 4). The teen actors had a short part and that was ok because they were kind of throw away anyway. I may only be in my 30s but man kids these days are so spoiled rotten and vain. At least that's what this movie has you believe. The movie feels a bit too long in the tooth, as in I can guess wahs would be checking their watches during the last third of the film. It wasn't a bad film it just could have been better.

The humour is misplaced and isn't funny, that opening scene with Poe Dameron in his X-wing joking with the commander of the imperial fleet is very much cringeworthy and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Also PLEASE someone explain just why Kylo Ren is so dark-side obsessed? Anakin at least had a reason and was an awesome villain. Kylo just seems like a 13-year-old who got his black eyeliner taken away. What a lack of respect for the Star Wars universe. Leia flying in space was so bad. And BB8 driving was stupid.

negative,"  TFA had a duty to try to draw in new fans as well as please old ones, and it accomplished that duty fairly well. It setup some new characters for new fans to love and still did ok with the original characters. Harrison Ford would not have come back unless he was given a death scene, so he got his wish. Carrie was treated well and Mark was left out almost entirely but I wholeheartedly believe that JJ had planned on the next film (Ep 8) to be ""Luke's story"" and to make up for him having only 10 seconds of screen time in the first movie. He had setup some decent new characters that could have some amazing backstories explained later and character arcs. Rey was definitely a mary sue, but at least Finn was someone with a decent arc to his story. Poe was meant to be disposable but Isaac is just too likable. So we finally get to Episode 8 and we are dying after waiting 2 years to get payoff's to all the threads that JJ opened up with Snoke, the First Order, Rey-Finn-Poe and to see Luke get the story he deserved and we had waited decades to see. What do we get instead? We get a complete mess of a movie with plot holes that would be expected in a first-time director's indie film but not in the 8th film in one of the largest film franchises in cinema history. The movie starts out horrible with jokes that don't land, a huge plot hole dealing with how gravity works in space, and only gets way worse from there. Finn gets destroyed in this movie, despite being the only one of the 3 new characters with an interesting character arc. He's originally used just as another lame sight gag and joke that fails to land or be funny. Then he's almost treated like a coward, then he goes off on a side-plot with yet another new character, which was another huge mistake, and the movie then spend a painful amount of time dealing with their side-plot that makes no sense, isn't necessary, isn't wanted and wasn't even any good. According to the setup, the entirety of what's left of the Republic (which is odd since they were in complete power with peace in the galaxy for 30 years since the end of RotJ, yet just because the First Order destroyed 5 planets, the entire galaxy is now under heel of a much smaller military force than the Empire was? Yet, with what little the Republic/Rebellion has left running out of gas out in space, waiting to die, Finn and Rose have to spend time setting free a bunch of slave animals and would have failed entirely if not for BB-8 who is remarkably capable for a metal ball. Somehow, BB-8 became more baddass than Captain Phasma, which is another of the huge mistakes Rian makes in this joke of a movie that he somehow got away with. Every great character that JJ set up in the first installment of this trilogy was completely screwed over by Rian in TLJ. Poe looks like a cocky a-hole traitor, Finn is played for gags, gets tossed on a side quest, forced into a love interest after being denied the hero death that everyone else got to have. All the men are useless and all the women are making the decisions and doing all the ""right"" things. (along with BB-8) And I could spend hours on how this movie completely and fundamentally f's up Luke Skywalker. Decades in the making and Rian Johnson destroys him in just over 2 hours. Rian repeatedly, REPEATEDLY gave the middle finger to long-time fans of the series and the very people that have made it the huge money-maker that it is today. Luke, Leia, Admiral Akbar, etc were all completely screwed over, even the new characters were completely screwed, all the great new threads that JJ set up in TFA were just tossed away the same way Luke tosses Anakin's lightsaber over a cliff. How in the world this movie was ever greenlit and allowed to exist is beyond me. How the hell is managed to get 91% with critics just shows how corruptable that system obviously is. Even trying to stand on its own, this movie is horrible and full of plot holes, jokes that aren't funny and an entire side-plot that makes no sense and yet takes up nearly a third of the movie. And when placed into the context of being the middle movie of a new trilogy that also exists as part of a galaxy of films that already include two other trilogies, then this film is even weaker and falls even harder. I feel sorry for all the fans that Rian screwed over and shattered the hopes of with this laughable excuse for a film. I also feel sorry for Mark Hamill who was contractually obligated to film this crap and poor Carrie who we won't get to see again and have the ending she deserved. Kathleen Kenedy needs to be fired, Rian needs to keep his incompetent hands out of the Star Wars universe and poor JJ has a lot on his shoulders now to not only somehow fix all that Rian just f'd up, but somehow win back the fans that he flipped off in the process.

negative,"  The bottom line is I did not like the movie at all. Yes, I saw the original trilogy as a kid and yes I had high expectations for the movie to be good. First, I felt the plot was not that great. All that build up for Luke to get his light saber back and then he threw it told me this was not going to be good. The bad jokes, the slow space chase of the Resistance from the First Order, the uselessness of all the new characters, the Disney toy plug with the meaninglessness of the Casino planet adventure, Leia blasted into space, making Finn and Poe look stupid versus every female character, cowardly Luke, leaving Snoke an empty character and poor man's Hoth battle with just a handful of the Resistance left made for a long disappointing story. I don't know if JJ Abrams can fix thus with Episode 9 but I have no interest in Rian Johnson's trilogy because I think he did a poor job of trying to open up the Star Wars saga to a new audience by insulting the loyal fans that go back to the 1970's with a poorly written and directed movie that went against George Lucas vision. I have no ill will. I just don't have any interest in Rian Johnson's vision.",The Last Jedi,304

negative,"  The Creature was having sex with the girl come on!!! I have no idea how the critics can think this was a great movie. The acting was good no issue their and the way it was filmed looked amazing but it was the movie itself that was bad. I understand the storyline about the girl who was kinda a little different cause she can't talk and she feels lonely see a creature who is being mistreated because he is different and misunderstood I understand .It started off okay not good but by the time the creature started having sex with the girl I couldn't help but to start shaking my head and start laughing. Also what was up with Giles trying to hit on the guy at the cafe.The director Guillermo del Toro took the whole idea from the creature from the black lagoon but put his own spin on it and took out the good parts of the movie and added a muted girl and a creature who can dance,heal people and even save life or two. They tired to save it at the end but when the girl all of a sudden grew gills like a fish just put the nail in the coffin. The critics need to be drug tested and hopefully a good director will see this be upset and get the rights to make the Creature from the black lagoon the way it was supposed to be. It will be a very long time before I go see a Guillermo del Toro movie. He's weird but not a good weird but an awful weird.

Everything moves quickly, characters are introduced clumsily and nothing about what makes each character special ever feels believable. The CGI is plentiful yet cheesy.

negative,"  The endless stream of references made the movie seem cheesy and really devoid of any substance. That was a bit confusing to me considering that one of the things that I loved about the book was the endless stream of references; however, having a couple of days to reflect on it, I realized that the difference in my reactions to the references in the movie and the book really boils down to the fact that the references were a major plot point in the book. In the book, you can't solve Halliday's puzzles without a very deep knowledge of 70s and 80s pop/nerd culture. The puzzles are all about knowing how to win a certain video game or run through a specific D&D module. Thus the fact that the characters put so much stock in having nerd cred makes sense in the books and thus doesn't come off as vapid pandering. Having nerd cred could net you in excess of half a trillion dollars and control of the Oasis. Any of you would learn the shit out of a video game if you thought it would help you earn half a trillion dollars.In the movie, the references play a much smaller (almost non-existent) role in winning Halliday's prize. With the exception of the final key, all of the challenges are focused on knowing Halliday himself - having intimate knowledge of his regrets and desires. Spielberg picked up on one small mention of Halliday having a love interest in the book and blew it up into Halliday's single most important character trait for the film. This strips many of the references of their necessary context and makes them come off as unnecessary pandering. They are cheesy. The only remotely entertaining reference involved the use of Chucky as a WMD.On the surface the book is about nostalgia; however, it's not about mindless nostalgia. One of the most brilliant things that Kline did was to turn nostalgia into a plot device through which he could explore nerd culture (both of the past and the future) and re-imagine Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in a new futuristic setting. He brought that morality tale - a tale of overcoming corporate greed and valuing relationships - into the 21st century using the 20th century as a plot device to develop deeper connections with his own childhood as well as with his readers.",Ready Player One,1493

negative,"  The film is a middle finger to the audience. When I was walking out the cinema I remember thinking did the director and writer even see the previous film or any other star wars film. All through the film it was constantly preaching political messages getting in the way of the story, although the George Lucas films did have this at times, but it was very subtle. It basically treats the audience like they are idiots. So many poor characters written badly to be honest I feel sorry for the actors in the film because I feel they were made to look like fools. Once again they ripped off the original trilogy episodes 5 and 6, so extra marks for originality (sarcasm). I feel I could go on much longer put trying to keep this short so I will simply say this worst stars film EVER, yes, worse than Phantom Menace.

negative,"  The final nail in the coffin that made me quit whatever StarWars, that Disney puts out. Just like I quit Star Trek.At the moment I am perfectly fine with reading any StarWars book published pre-2012, before watching any of these feminist-infected logic-deprived SJW-trash filled with character-assassinations of any known male. I was appalled that they weren't even subtle about what their agenda was. Force Awakens was at least watchable.2 months before watching this in december I began to see the signs after classifying the structure that these people uses to base their story around. Because they don't care about keeping inside the boundary of established lore or create characters that has exciting and interesting challenges to overcome and grow from. Both inside and outside.SJW's has an idea that they want to show women as morally superior in any way, while men being brutish and wrong, even though they actually have a point.But that is not all. Every decision for this movie's story was completely retarded and it wasted every interesting plotline and characters to the point of stupidity. And that is not counting Luke Skywalker's 180 degree change in his personality without any reasonable justification other than to tell a joke and make the main character of Rey being even more morally superior than she already is. Everything was so dull.The movie effectively killed off anything that was interesting in StarWars(from Force Awakens) to the point that there is absolutely no reason to watch it anymore.But it is all okay, I believe. Even though they wasted the opportunity to having Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford back in these movie, this will stand as a testimony of how to not treat a franchise as the market balances itself out, and no one caring anymore whenever Disney puts out more StarWars.I will be fine reading through loads of books from the legends canon, knowing that it can only be much better than this crap.

There is almost no super hero action and the character arcs all seem built upon making sure each character gets their big triumphant moment without enough investment to make it meaningful when they do so. There is very little black panther in this black panther movie and our hero loses almost every fight he is in only winning by sheer luck at the last second in most. Overall this is a sub par superhero movie with some good moments and a nice political narrative that carries the film in spite of all its other flaws.

But, no, we get the cock tease otherwise known as The Force Awakens, followed by The Last Jedi, which douses the audience in ice water and then throws the saga into the abyss.After the fall of Kylo in Episode 7, Episode 8 could be the fall of the New Republic after a surprise assault from the outer regions by Snoke and the First Order. Galactic warfare and desolation on a Titanic scale (instead of the slow speed search for a petrol dump the Last Jedi took). The Force Awakens, Rey comes to the forefront, Han Solo dies.In Episode IX they would be set up for the grand finale between Luke, Rey, Kylo, and whatever other baddie Abrams has planned.Point is, they could have the story go in the same direction as they intended all along, but not fuck the fans with crap movies while getting there.TLJ is gutter trash, and pulls TFA into the sewer with it.

There is no way this movie is 91% fresh, that would be like critics saying ""Batman & Robin"" is a far superior film to ""The Dark Knight"" The Last Jedi is a movie basically made out of greed. Any reality or common sense in this film is completely out the window. This movie is a horrible mess filled with plot holes, rehashed ideas, WTF moments and dumb decisions. Disney has decided to push their politics (while milking any last remaining cash from original Star Wars fans) instead of telling a good story that makes any sense within the entire Star Wars saga. The humor in the film falls extremely flat. Most of the jokes with Rey and Luke are just so brutal to watch. I feel for Mark Hamill in this one, because you can tell he hated being in this stupid film. The stupid cheesy lines of dialog in the film are as bad as any in the Star Wars prequels. Luke comments on Leia's hair? Luke and Leia (two character icons) and haven't appeared together on screen since 1983, and that's all he has to say??? The saddest thing about The Last Jedi is the total lack of respect and judgement that Disney and Rian Johnson has shown to everything that was created before it. Watching this movie is like watching beloved old friends being marched into Disney death camps.

I really wanted to love this movie, but someone could skip this movie and only need a short star wars opening crawl to catch up: Luke dies because he used the force to hard, Snoke was killed by Kylo because reason, and the rebels and first order are exactly where they were at the end of force awakens except now the first order is run by Kylo who I'm not even sure is a bad guy anymore or what his motivation even is.

Removing the role of men and manhood and replacing it with a more feminine and transgender influence. What a joke. Star wars and movies in general were at once a place for escape for movie goers from the real word so to speak. Luke Skywalker's character was the most disappointing for a Star wars fan. I may never again go to see Star Wars even if there is another made. I choose now to remain forever as thinking that Star Wars ended with the Return of the Jedi, as the last seen clearly shows.

But, as with that film, 30 minutes in, and I was done. The costumes and production design were quite creative, but I had zero emotional investment in any of the characters. How can you possibly sit thru a story where you don't FEEL anything (except bored and antsy)?

negative,"  The movie honestly leaves you bewildered after the first billing. You are in awe because it is star wars, but also confused because it doesn't exactly read as starwars either. After multiple viewings, the negatives really weigh down the positives. The movie has a strong issue with pacing, character development and also the addition of unnecessary scenes and sub plots that don't really add to the main conflict of the story. Along with this there is a saturation of characters that do not fit the established star wars aesthetic, and seem to be there for the sake of representation and even politics outside of the franchise. Sadly the established characters also suffer, and instead feel like new characters who are only related to their former iterations by name, ie Luke. A heroic character like Luke still could of have been portrayed as someone despaired by tragedies and wants to break from old traditions, but the execution was poorly done. Lastly, the film feels like an end to a series instead of a middle film to a trilogy. And besides that, there isn't a strong continuation between 7 and 8 like their predecessors in the saga. The movie is still a beautiful example of cinematography in an artistic form stronger than previous films. Also if you focus generally on Rey and Kylo's tension, especially when confronted by Snoke, you will be captivated especially when considering the poetry of the past films that led up to their characters. Hoping for the best with the concluding film to this trilogy to bring back what made Star War really captivating.",The Last Jedi,186
negative,"  The movie is a 6/10 for me . It was almost nothing like the game . Alicia vikander is a great lara croft. The dialogue was ass . Walton goggings didnt do the character he was suppose to good but that's obv the writers fault but in terms of his acting all he did the whole movie was look suprised and talked slow . The movie lacks emotion , it's like no one was alicia was trying . There's a decent amount of cheesy action movie stuff . ",Tomb Raider,10234
negative,"  The movie is a little pretentious, but overall is pretty decent. It shares several elements with STALKER. It's well directed, doesn't have lots of pace problems (but theres a huge difference from mid to end), and the visuals/setting are nice, leaving a small impression of something alien, but it's pretty recognizable as a terran woodland.The movie mixes real science with the si-fi, but the end result is a little shallow. The open end just adds pretentiousness. The CGI is pretty bad.Natalie Portman was excellent, but the rest of the cast was a little uneven. And even though the cast is pretty diverse, the best part is that there's ZERO white male representation.",Annihilation,4310
negative,  The movie is a sad remake of a beloved character. The done to death formula has nothing new to offer and the average acting by supporting cast doesn't help the cause at all. Alicia is wonderful as the main lead but the supporting cast has nothing new to offer. Overall the movie is very bland and predictable with average dialogues and some good looking CGI in couple of the scenes.,Tomb Raider,10261

negative,"  The movie is basically a pinnacle of Kathleen Kennedy's crusade towards pushing bigotrous agenda. The setup the Episode VII has been ignored giving Rian Johnson unlimited power as to commit a rape of Star Wars universe. If you enjoyed the Original Trilogy, respect, love and relate to its characters, stay away from this atrocity of a movie.The plot and character development are a lame jape and never have I seen so much identity politics shoved in cinematic experience just to pander to certain demographics in an attempt to maximize profits. I rejoice in seeing the agenda and approach introduced by the current Lucasfilm president fails. Doubling down or even tripplilng down on her agenda will lead Star Wars further towards 6 feet underground. I will neither acknowledge, nor forgive Kahleen Kennedy for calling shots as to killing off one the best Star Wars charcters (spolier alert, this character's name rhymes with Johnny Walker).Absolutely disgracefull and self-righteous of current Lucasfilm leadership to stand for this film, not acknowledge obvious mistakes and ideological overtone they are so desperately trying to push.",The Last Jedi,643

negative,"  The movie is good. But the problem with the movie is that it COMPLETELY removes the third act of the game and has a scooby doo moment where they 'rip of the mask' and say, ""OH, it isn't supernatural after all, its just SCIENCE.""I'm sorry, but they should have never left out Himiko being an actual demon queen and her fuedal japan samurai immortal army that is keeping everyone trapped on the island until the curse is broken.

negative,"  the movie, ""A Wrinkle In Time"", was to me, and very disappointing one. Starring Storm Reid as Meg Murry and Levi Miller as Calvin O'Keffe, I found myself in a tornado of dispointment and grief. That is metaphorical because I referenced to the tornado of bad-ness (which i found politically incorrect due to the ebony color). I found this movie vitriol to the soul, leading me to suicidal and self-harming thoughts. These emotions were brought up by the fact that the main characters did not smack lips. The result of missing the interlocked lips, i concluded a lower rating i would perceive that this movie is deserving of.I am in deep aungish and am in search of a mental hospital or family theripist close to the area around the tesserae due to the deep wounds cut in my flesh from the film. The promised lip - intertwinement i deserved was never offered or given.

negative,"  The music in the film is phenomenal, and there a a few moments with speculator effects, primarily involving a space battle, other than this I have nothing positive to say about this film. The scenes are acted well for the most part but the scrip and plot are very week. The protagonist seems extremely powerful and important yet there seems to be no reason why. She meets one of the greatest characters in film history and he doesn't train her...she is already powerful and his actions make him unrecognizable to the hero we once new. This is the longest Star Wars movie AND has the least content, not much actually happened in this film yet...all the best characters a dead. By itself this is a bad film, being a Star Wars films, I would say it's the worse yet. I'd rather watch Battle for Endor.",The Last Jedi,431

Otherwise, this was a real Hollywood wet dream--2 women, one Black and one Latin, a Jew, and a Homosexual all battling evil Caucasian men-one American Gestapo like character, his commanding officer, and 2 Russian spies to protect an oppressed God-like creature.

negative,"  The only good parts in this movie had to do with Luke and Rey. All the other new characters were terrible. Poe is the new Jar Jar Binks, except Jar Jar was a more competent commander. Leia and purple haired Laura Dern are the worst military minds ever. They don't share information with their underlings, leading to resentment and mutiny and then they laugh it off because Poe is cute. This move sets back women's rights 1000 years.This movie supposedly took risks. BS. If they really wanted to take a risk they would have killed off Finn in the part where Rose saves him because she's everything she despises. Finn's character would have gone through an amazing arc, actually giving a damn and sacrificing himself. Rose's character is pointless. Finn and Rose's wild adventure is pointless.

Not only is it dull and empty, it completely takes away from the majesty that was Madeleine L'Engle's classic. From taking away religious/Christian references, to taking out some of our favorite characters, and most of all, Ava DuVernay's adaptation also hurts when she decided to take out one of the best lines in the book.

There was one scene I loved where Luke got excited to see R2 and it was great watching him again. Then he sunk into this deep voice that drove me nuts - yeah, he was old but old Ben still looked sober at least.

negative,"  The Shape Of Water...from a director I used to respect and like, a complete garbage of a white saviour film masquerading as a liberal artsy piece...AKA how to try and fail to be Avatar/ET. Every single character in this film is a stereotype - written from the perspective of a straight white man trying and failing to portray the voice of the oppressed. We have caricatures at every turn - from the deliberately unempowered and literally voiceless, doe-eyed female Latino cleaner Eliza who feels a desperate need to become a saviour but who ends up getting saved, to the magical negro trope in Zelda, to the un-empathetic and law abiding male in her husband, to the evil Caucasian American Gestapo man who rapes his wife, who's only there to make dinner, look pretty and get raped (a rape that's there as a trope, for which there is no consequence), to the 'savage' from the rainforest that is a literal depiction of a white supremacist colonial mindset of the oppressed, needing to be rescued, to the gay neighbour ('the gay sidekick') who suddenly decides to help save a creature he's never seen before because he's rejected by a man in a diner, to the moustache twirling Russians, to the overt female nudity and objectification for which there is no male counterpart. Eliza is such a blank canvas of a personality with no backstory besides being an orphan that her only desire and purpose in this film is to save the 'man' she loves...because obviously female leads are only really concerned with love and men. The experience of oppression is nuanced and varies from person to person - being female or gay, or black, are not the same thing and it's simplistic to bulk every oppressed caricature in the film and gang them up against a cardboard cut-out of an evil white man.

negative,"  the story could have been told in 20 minutes, what little story there is.",A Wrinkle in Time,3583
negative,"  The story is a total mess, for starters. It's packed with narrative holes and leaden dialogue, and the whole enterprise is hopelessly trapped inside a tortuous series of incompatible timelines that stretch credibility well beyond anything that even setting the story in a galaxy far, far away can excuse.The film's tone is all over the place, too, switching horribly awkwardly between (usually painfully lame) humor, serious 'Force stuff' and lots of people dying without even trying to establish any sort of context for its changing moods.Dull, messy scripts can sometimes be rescued by great direction. But sadly, despite his enjoyable efforts with Looper, writer/director Rian Johnson consistently fluffs the job of filming his own words.Tense scenes fail to build tension. Dramatic scenes deliver no drama. Emotionally charged scenes lack emotional charge. Fight scenes look horribly stilted and leaden. Jokes generally feel so labored or are delivered so abruptly that they feel more like a slap in the face than something that might actually make you laugh.I really can't think of a single important scene where you get any sense that Johnson understands how to use imagery to add power to the film's generally underwhelming events.The Last Jedi's many filmmaking fails left me with almost nothing I could latch on to in order to become immersed in the action, leaving me desperate for the whole dull mess to come to an end at least an hour before it did.

negative,"  The trailer is better than the movie, that's for sure. I've said it before so many times that it's become redundant- the critics are an enigma to say the least. I really don't know why this film has gotten such high marks from them because it pretty much leaves you scratching your head at the end. Maybe that's what they look for in these films. But for us average low brow movie goers it's really not that great. Sure wish I had the high IQ that is required to appreciate this film. The critics consensus says ""Annihilation backs up its sci-fi visual wonders and visceral genre thrills with an impressively ambitious -- and surprisingly strange -- exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll."" Where do they come up with this stuff?? Do they even know what they said? Did they really even watch the movie? I have to wonder. 2 stars, only because it kept me interested to see the outcome, which was a disappointment and could have been better.",Annihilation,4268
negative,  The trailer led us to believe that it would follow the fantastic video game closely. It does at first but then it became a huge let down. I kept waiting for the scary elements and supernatural events to happen that took place in the game. But the movie does a complete 180 to remain realistic. If you haven't played the game then the movie might be entertaining. Just another average video game movie/,Tomb Raider,9912

negative,"  The visuals of this movie are absolutely stunning, and the score is awesome. Chris Pine's acting is also phenomenal and is totally believable. However, that doesn't help save the movie from its many, many, many flaws. I found Meg to be a very unlikeable character (which is ironic considering her name is Meg), all the lore and backstories were uninteresting to me, and Calvin had no purpose is this movie apart from being the token white boy. And Charles Wallace...just...UGH!! I know he's only six-years-old, but I REALLY wanna beat him up. Instead of being cute and intelligent, he comes across as a know-it-all and a really rude one at that. Honestly, one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen. Overall, I think this movie had the potential to be really great, but the plot and the leading roles' acting is what made this movie fall so very short.",A Wrinkle in Time,3059
negative,"  The visuals, while often quite imaginative seemed at the same time stale and extravagant.

negative,"  The voiceover work is good, with John Cena turning in a decent performance as a the gentle giant. And unlike The Emoji Movie before it, Ferdinand actually has a bit of heart to it. Unfortunately, the film's scenes are cobbled together and copied from other, better adventures. The pacifist message of the movie is not exactly new, but it feels especially out-of-place in the violent world of bullfighting. It's very similar to the theme of 1998's Pokemon: The First Movie, and like that movie, the message is meaningless once the movie ends, because we all know that the pacifism does nothing for the world of the movie.",Ferdinand,5897

Disrespects the mythos of Star Wars and its original characters, and to top it all of, the high ups at Lucasfilm continue to insult the original fans for not liking this movie.

negative,"  There are plenty of animated films that follow the same sort of formula, make the kids laugh with silly humor but keep the adults entertained by throwing in a heartfelt message that resonates well with people of all ages. Ferdinand certainly tries to do just that with the story of an outsider just wanting to break the mold of being a tough fighter bull, but it also falls victim to the same sort of problems that most non-Disney/Pixar films do.It's always so easy to tell the difference between an animated film that is for all ages and one that is merely made for kids dragging their parents to the theater, and it has nothing to do with the animation style difference between studios. The real difference is in the humor and direction. Ferdinand is full of great voice talent from the improving John Cen, to Kate McKinnon, Daveed Diggs, or Gina Rodriguez. Heck it's even impressive in the look of Blue Sky's animation. However, I had a real issue with the use of that particular voice talent and animation that made the experience far from a worthy outing at the movies.When 98% of the humor is physical-slapstick cheap humor that has no substance or bearing on the actual story, then I constantly get the feeling there wasn't as much time or care put forth in the making of the film than there should be. Which in turn, can eliminate any emotion you did have attached with those particular characters in the first place if the film puts humor before heart.With that said, of course there are things to like about Ferdinand. There will always be place in Hollywood for stories about characters breaking the mold and doing something different, whether that be a human, animal, or even toy. Underneath all of the ridiculous humor, there is a nice arc for the character of Ferdinand and his various animal friends. To me though, the misplaced childish humor every few minutes interrupts any momentum for the real story to kick in.5.7/10",Ferdinand,6023
negative,"  There are so many comedy moments and the main antagonist turns out to be a pushover. There are also many predictable events and very few surprises.

negative,"  There are some interesting parts here, but the movie feels a bit flat. It could have benefited from either picking one genre or the other (scifi or horror) or not pussyfooting around both and just going straight in. I can't help but think this is one of those movies where they (at best) adapt half of a book into a movie, but leave out more than enough to not make it a good watch.",Annihilation,3972
negative,"  There are two things working in this film's favour: one is the nostalgic value attached to the 1995 original and the brand Jumanji - which, surprisingly and charmingly, is only updated here from the board game to a video game cartridge circa 1996 (but there's always the threequel, folks, for something more 2018) and the other is the simple premise of having well known actors/stars play against type - as in: what if Jack Black plays a self-obsessed girl or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays a nerd. And to this film's credit, they milked them to their fullest extent and manages quite a lot of mileage out of it. Unfortunately the rest of the film feels fairly by the book and the life lessons learnt are admirable but rather tame and unremarkable. The special effects are perfunctory, as are the cast of young unknowns and their more famous counterparts - everyone does a good job but nothing stands out as being particularly spectacular or exciting here. While the video game rules are played out in a consistently fun way and provides a clean and clear structure for the film to hang its set pieces on, the occasional sparks found in the half decent and amusing script might have worked better if they haven't been so overexposed for the trailers. In the end, this is undemanding fluff and manages just not to disappoint (or antagonize) too much in a situation where no one (except the creatively dried up studios) demands a sequel or a reboot but the audience is getting one anyway.",Jumanji,7020

negative,"  There was a moment in Wrinkle in Time when it showed darkness reaching the Earth and slowly engulfing it. It gave me chills. The movie suddenly felt extremely timely. It may have been talking about a popular girl struggling with an eating disorder and a great student being bullied by his father to do even better. But for me it looked like a perfect illustration of what has been happening in our world politically over the last couple of years. There were a few more poignant moments in the film. But, unfortunately, just moments. And there was just one character that felt alive - Charles Wallace. He made me cry real tears. Little Deric McCabe outacted a bunch of grownups, some of whom are Oscar winners. Reese Witherspoon, whom I loved in so many different roles, was just all Legally Blonde here. Poor Mindy Kahling was reduced to smiling and saying words that weren't even her character's own. Oprah was being Oprah - no more, no less. Chris Pine was stuck in a permanent state of angst. And Zack Galifianakis made an attempt to liven up his character, but was quickly subdued into a state of permanent soulfulness. It is so sad to see all these great performers acting as if they were making a photo shoot for the movie, not the movie itself. Or better yet - one of those fake rides they have at Universal Studios.

negative,"  There's no denying the importance that this movie may have for some audiences. The mere fact that this past weekend saw the first time 2 movies with 2 directors of color top the box office is astonishing and inspiring. It's long overdue, and should be lauded. On that note, A Wrinkle in Time is a film that ends up being of far more importance than it does a film that will please most. To say the least, it's a mess.I walked out of the theater trying to quantify what this film felt like, and I think to me, it's a Disney Channel Original Movie with the budget of your typical summer blockbuster. The budget of a little over 100 million is actually historic, for giving the first black woman a budget that high to direct a film. But that's not even necessarily the problem with the film. The problem lies with the screenplay and perhaps partially DuVernay's direction.I've never read the book, nor had the interest to, but I have to imagine there was an easier way to adapt this book than the result we got. The story revolves around Meg, who's father has gone missing for years, as she tries to travel through time and space with a few strange beings, her brother, and a new friend from school. Perhaps some audiences, mostly on the younger side, will connect to the story of reconnection and family, but the execution is mind-bogglingly silly.There are particular story choices in the 3rd act that are laughably out of place, and even a few blatant mistakes in directing that I never truly could grasp how they got past the editing room. If this were to have come out when I was younger, perhaps it's something I could connect with. But a well-performed and semi-visually impressive film isn't enough to surpass all of the frustrating mistakes in the script and direction.4.0/10",A Wrinkle in Time,3163

negative,"  There's nothing wrong with a kids flick, is there? Kids like images, and they can easily be entertained. There are many examples of movies that have been released for kids, especially those from Disney, that have appealed to kids and have found great success. And then there's ""Peter Rabbit"", an adaptation of the stories by Beatrix Potter, that sort of misses the mark when it comes to making a movie for kids. While the film itself isn't terrible by all means, it does suffer quire a bit. More so in favor of the movie's direction than anything else. ""Peter Rabbit"" may be a kids movie, but it seems as if it is caught in its own trap of familiarity.The story follows the titular Peter Rabbit (James Corden), who, along with his siblings Cottontail (Daisy Ridley), Flopsy (Margot Robbie), and Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki), and his cousin Benjamin (Matt Lucas), steal vegetables from a nearby garden. But the garden belongs to Old Man McGregor (Sam Neil) who hates rabbits with a passion. One day, McGregor suddenly dies, and an heir named Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) is not too happy with Peter and his clan. Now, Peter must use his wits to get rid of Thomas so that the garden will be free, and their neighbor Bea (Rose Byrne) can accept either Peter or Thomas for affection.""Peter Rabbit"" offers up nothing new or exciting from previous kids films that make this film interesting. Going off the deep end, the major problem with this movie is with the pacing. The movie flows at an incredible pace, not allowing the viewer to slow down and take things in. This, in turn, can be attributed towards the camera; it moves rather fast, and all of the cuts in the movie make the viewer question what just happened.Throughout the entire production, we have a combination of both live action and animation; the animation provided by Sony Pictures Animation, which feels weak when compared to their previous features. Going right into the main flaw, the animation looks very realistic, and could have represented the actual drawings from the books that the main character comes from. Speaking of, there is a little section at the beginning of the film where we get to see the backstory of Peter, told through hand drawn animation, which is represented beautifully. Had the production used the art that was here on their key central characters, then the movie would have been fine to look at.The major problem with the film as a whole, is with the story itself. As one watches the film, they can find where the first, second, and third act is located. As well as many moments that do not make sense, and knowing where the film will be headed. ""Peter Rabbit"" has predictability written all over it.With that being said, there are one or two things that the film does manage to pull off. First, the cast does do a good job, despite the material they are given; all of the actors are given an over-the-top performance, but not too heavily. The one thing that does make the movie stand out is the cinematography. Everything from the landscapes to the sets, the movie more than makes up for it.But all of this doesn't excuse ""Peter Rabbit"" a standard by the books kids film.In conclusion, ""Peter Rabbit"" tries to be a good kids film, but ends up hopping away with its own mistakes.",Peter Rabbit,8116

negative,"  Thirty-nine years after Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpiece, director Alex Garland, who debuted with ""Ex Machina"" in 2014, released last month his version of ""Stalker"" called ""Annihilation,"" a fitting title as it ""refracts"" the original beauty of ""Stalker"" into something unrecognizable.The film's main premise rests predominantly on the Shimmer, a soap bubble-like field that slowly growing, mutating and ""refracting"" the DNA of all that it touches. In the film, Lena (Natalie Portman) is grieving the loss of her husband. When she musters up enough courage to paint their bedroom, her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac) appears. Not long after, Kane starts coughing up blood, and eventually they all get taken to Area X, a super top secret military base. This parallels the story of ""Stalker,"" where the mysterious Stalker acts as guide for three unnamed men and take them deep into the Zone, all in hopes of finding the Room, which can grant them any wish. Like ""Annihilation"", ""Stalker"" also doesn't pick up until 40 minutes in, wherein they finally step into the Zone.All this exposition, though uncomfortable for any other movie, works well here. It establishes the characters, and had the movie any depth, it would allow us to care about and understand them. ""Annihilation's"" first pitfall is that none of the characters are particularly likable and are more akin to walking stereotypes. The movie refuses to believe in the audience's abilities, repeatedly using flashback sequences to reiterate a point, patronizing the audience.One of the reasons why ""Stalker"" is hailed as a masterpiece is due to its method of storytelling. Unlike later directors such as Wong Kar-Wai, the formula for a character study had not yet been laid. The idea of a story without a plot was still new. But ""Stalker""at its very core was a character study on not only the three unnamed men, but also a metaphor for life.At the core of ""Annihilation"" is a ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" - a movie that leaves the audience wondering what in the world is going on, and whether they've had a ""Close Encounter of the Third Kind"" or the turd kind. ""Annihilation"" also suffers from ""Interstellar"" syndrome - the need to explain everything in a scientific way, but then suddenly turning a blind eye to science by asserting that somehow love transcends space and time. In this case, the Shimmer can simply do what it likes with complete disregard to everything that happened earlier. As Dr. Lena put it, ""That's literally not possible.""""Annihilation"" takes but does not give. It steals from countless classics with its cinematography, set design and plot. Even the dilapidated wooden shack that Tarkovsky loves so much is in the movie, as well as the stargate sequence from the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""But ""Annihilation"" does not even attempt to build upon its predecessors. Annihilation"" would be seen as an inaccessible movie that tries to be a bit everything while succeeding at none.",Annihilation,3977

negative,"  This excuse of a movie should not even have the honor to be called a Star Wars movie. Just I thought it could not get worse. Total lack of scenario, of epicness, of star warsness.

negative,"  This felt like a Michael bay movie, they spent too much time on special fx instead of the dialog. I can't get over how awful the acting was. They tried way too hard, but thats how 99% of Marvel movies are these days. Marvel movies dont have the rewatchability like most other movies, especially Black Panther...Try again Marvel!",Black Panther,2882
negative,"  This film breaks fundamental narrative rules, lacks character arc, emotion, and wastes its time on several pointless subplots. Ultra-progressive in underlying themes and its protagonist is the greatest ""Mary Sue"" in the history of filmmaking. Disney has failed the fans and destroyed this franchise.",The Last Jedi,492
negative,"  This film breaks virtually every rule in storytelling to politicise some silly notions about societal reform and methodically sets about destroying the very canon which it tried to use as a springboard for their ideology. I never thought that ""I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating.."" Could be made to look like compelling writing but here we are. I was upset about what was done to Star Trek, but this is a much higher level in perversion of canon.",The Last Jedi,929
negative,  This film deserves a R18 as it is simply unwatchable for teens and kids alike.,The Death of Stalin,8368
negative,  This film didn't respect the past instead they destroyed it too many jokes and no link to the new trilogy but the film is shot beautifully and it could of been better than this. expand the universe Disney make new threat for the new order and the rebels that will make it more interesting. ps mabe a fan of force awakens will like it more just too many missed opportunities.,The Last Jedi,39
negative,"  This film has a classic premise, a director with a clear vision of what he wants the film to be, and about 8 minutes of really great practical gore effects. However, the film is bogged down by an extremely deliberate pace that betrays the danger at hand and forces the viewer to apply extreme focus to remain engaged when there's not a ton there to chew on at times. Plus an ending that will leave a lot of mainstream cinema goers who just want to munch popcorn and forget about the flick 10 minutes after its over scratching their heads and wondering what they'd just seen. I would say that this film deserves a least a try from everyone who enjoys sci fi or horror.",Annihilation,4429
negative,"  This film is a complete disgrace. The 2003 version was a far superior. This adaptation is all visuals and no substance version of this class novel.

negative,"  This film is a nightmare with terrible plot and poor acting from the female lead. If it wasnt Levi Miller, I had given it 0 star, Levi acting and character is the only reason i even bothered to give this trash 1 star.

negative,"  This film is hot garbage juice. Pretty hot garbage juice, but garbage juice nonetheless. Nonsensical character arcs, pointless characters, pointless story-crushing ""twists"" and a truly short-sighted view to the franchise by the director/writers pushed purely to help push an agenda. 1 star for the visuals, 1 star for the truly fantastic performance from some of the actors in the face of their terrible script.",The Last Jedi,360

negative,"  This film is pretty consistently really nice to look at, I'll certainly admit that. However,, the utterly nonsensical plot eclipses this small positive. The film is difficult to watch without laughing. The characters make decisions and act in ways that are simply laughable, and are totally unrelatable. Those who rate it highly are incapable of logical thought or independent thinking. The critics are horribly wrong.1 star.",Annihilation,3940
negative,"  This film is so incoherent and disjointed that I'd need a second viewing to even remotely understand what the heck is going on and why. But I'm not a sadist, so that's just not going to happen. How you go from TFA and Rogue One to this is beyond me. Kathleen Kennedy needs to step down and let someone else take the reigns, and Rain Johnson should never be allowed to even watch another Star Wars film, let alone direct one. Actually, he can keep watching this train wreck over and over, since he was the engineer steering it off the rails.",The Last Jedi,173
negative,"  This film is supposed to be an uproarious dark comedy. It is dark. The Three Stooges moments are a little humorous. Unfortunately, the story is accurate enough that you can't forget the horrors of Stalin's regime. Steve Buscemi's conniving Kruschev and Jeffrey Tambor's bumbling Malenkov are the highlights of the movie.",The Death of Stalin,8272
negative,  This film looks sad...,Black Panther,2864
negative,"  This film made interesting choices, and was unique in itself, but it was very uncomfortable to watch, especially because one of the first things we see our main character do in their morning routine, it masturbate in the bathtub. The film was very different, but the plot was very predictable, and it was pretty obvious the entire time nothing bad was going to happen and she was going to end up with the creature from the Black Lagoon in the end, but it what didn't make since to me, is that the scratches on her neck turned into gills and she ended up being able to breah under water. I'd honestly like to see a weird love story like this not have the most strange but predictable ending ever and not end up with a ""happily ever after"". I'd say, if you're thinking about buying/renting this if you missed it in theatres, just pass on it. It's basically soft-core Creature of the Black Lagoon porn (it's almost like a fanfiction more than a movie).",The Shape of Water,8444
negative,"  This film ruined Lukes character and the story was unconsistent with force awakens. Ray's parents revelation was a huge upset to what it could of been and the casino scene was a waste of time. Lots of unexplained plot between the films and for the most part a lot of second thinking and twisting to the plot mid movie. Ryan Johnson wanted to try something new by dodging and weaving past every possible exspectation a longtime fan could of had thought up with that could of made any scene better to give us this dissapointment. Even skimming some of the theory forums could of given him an idea to what fans were anticipating and gone off it. Ray being a grand palpatine? Thus explaining her strong force powers and rapid skill, or snoke being plagaus? Giving that character far more meaning and significance and having luke duel him in a most epic showdown never before seen in star wars history, we are talking crators forming, ground cracking, planet evecuating level intensity. He instead made everything ""a twist"" and thus ruining the movie. Next time he should listen to the fans, if he gets a next time.",The Last Jedi,706
negative,"  This film ruined Star Wars for me. I have been a Fan for almost 20 years, loved the movies, the books and video games... HATE The Last Jedi. The Sequel Trilogy has nothing better to do than to burry all of your Childhood Heroes because ""the young audience wants to see the older generation pass the torch to a younger generation""... really? This film is worse than Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace combined.",The Last Jedi,940
negative,"  This film should be called ""A Wrinkled Mess."" The narrative is all over the place and the movie tries to rely on feelings instead of plot. The only problem? You're never pulled into the story long enough to feel anything.",A Wrinkle in Time,3002
negative,"  This film tries to be deep, it tries to be interesting, it tries to be different and It does this all in a bad way. I was looking forward to this movie because I saw that most people liked it and critics loved it. It's a lie everyone, don't waste your time. It's hard to even talk about this film because I got nothing out of it. It has been a while since I've seen a stinker because I research and try to find other opinions and if they are good I watch the film. I tried to be in denial after this movie because I was sad that it wasn't good. I wanted this to be great but It didn't turn out that way. Disappointment is the word that I would describe this movie. It was confusing and unstructured. It's super artsy but it doesn't have a good story or developed characters. The CGI is bad and the editing is decent. People travel from one place to a whole other area in the span of a cut at one point. This is a cinematic clusterfuck.",Annihilation,4162
negative,"  This film was a pretty big disappointment. Right off the bat, the audio is not mixed well. I was trying my hardest to listen to the dialogue but there was blaring music in the background. Next, the story was just not up to snuff. Endless plot holes and overall unbelievable performances across the board. Mindy's character had no depth. Charles Wallace was unbearable. He had a line or two that made me chuckle but on the whole, he was very obnoxious -- perhaps intentionally, but it made me dislike anytime he was on the screen. Some people hated the visuals but I actually thought they were some of the better parts of the film. It's world-building outside of the Earthling reality and it was cool to see this imaginative world. If only the story came together in a coherent, organized way with a believable script. Recommend others watch this when it hits Netflix.",A Wrinkle in Time,3337
negative,  This film was okay until the absurd ending in the final segment called the Lighthouse involving a crazy alien twin. Ugh. I didn't find it thought provoking at all.,Annihilation,4230

negative,  This film would've worked a lot better film if Octavia Spencer was cast as the lead. The female lead was too old and definitely not charming enough.,The Shape of Water,8550
negative,  This had all the makings of a good movie but it fell short. The acting wasn't the issue the plot wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. One of the main issues I had was the fact that they only sent out a small crew to find out what happened to the others so that made for the movie to be very slow and boring what I wished they would have done is put more people on the mission that way they could of had more action maybe have the mutant Gator and bear take out a few more people it would of made the movie a whole lot more interesting beisdes why would they only send five people out to an uncharted area where nobody has come back alive from you think they would have had atleast 10 or 15 more people with them. It also seemed like the movie was filmed with bad lighting it sure seemed dark a gritty inwhich this film should have popped off the screen especially when the went into the area X. My opinion is they wanted to make a good movie but they didn't want to spend the money on good cgi and put more but lesser known cast members in the movie .Should have been a movie but fell flat. Side note they still won't let me type my review for Black Panther. I just want to know why?,Annihilation,4761
negative,  This had the potential to be good and had high hopes being done by Disney. The story was confusing and spent too much time trying to impress and not enough time developing a good story.

negative,"  This has to be the worst Star wars movie . First of all it seems like everyone who worked on the film is not familiar or has not taken the time to really appreciate what star wars is all about . The movie has massive plot holes and doesn't seem to know where the saga left off in the last film , I mean how does the first order get so massive after just being decimated by the republic ? And how does the republic not help Lea and her group , they clearly had communication with the out side world . There is a lot of things that are wrong but godamnit why did you make Luke so unLuke like , Luke the guy who found good in the most evil villain in the star wars franchise tries to kill his nephew like WTF . I hate you Disney and Rian , you have alieneted the fans that supported the franchise all this while and for what ? , Branch diverse , feminine and progressive ? You have killed Star wars , I just hoped you wouldn't spoil Luke for us like you did Han Solo.",The Last Jedi,911
negative,"  This is a awefully normal high school show with unbearable cinematography and editing.

Whenever there's a serious moment, it's undercut with something goofy. The entire film feels like a big joke. They really dropped the ball with Luke's new character.

negative,"  This is a genuinely awful film, the only good thing about it will be seeing CinemaSins rip it to shreds. The plot is nonsensical, which can be forgiven because it's an action flick, but what I cannot excuse is that the action sequences in Ferris Bueller's Day Off are more thrilling.At a character level, this movie makes Lara a total idiot (NB mild spoilers ahead). Her marvellous plan at the start of the film is to agree to cause literally tens or hundreds of thousands of ¬£ worth of criminal damage to get paid ¬£600. Her plan in the middle of the film is to run off (injured) on her own with no food, water, medical supplies or WAY OF GETTING OFF THE ISLAND. Her plan towards the end is to strand a baddie by taking out the only escape route across a bridge - she is literally half way across the bridge at this point she could easily cross it to safety and take it down from the safe side, but no, she needs to go back to the side with the baddie so she can get stranded with him...

The character development had tons of potential but they turned out to be as shallow as a cartoon and the writing is cringe worthy. It ruined the legacy and my interest in Star Wars from this point forward. Half a star because it did look good sometimes.,The Last Jedi,260
negative,"  This is a visual spectacle...the CGi parts...but can't, for the life of me, understand the wooden statue performances. There are Oscar nominated actors/actresses (and one winner) in this movie who are saying lines, standing in place, showing nothing. If this is what the director was going for, then success. If not, I can't see the big hullabaloo. The women warriors were outstanding in action sequences---but said little. Michael B. Jackson should have at least been nominated for Fruitvale Station--should have Won an Oscar for Creed, but this is nothing comparatively speaking. When I think of Lupita's scenes in 12 years a Slave, I am still moved---as well as Daniel Kalaayua in Get Out. These performances are nothing next to those mentioned.

negative,  This is an ambitious attempt at creating a classic family film from a classic novel. The visual effects are breathtaking throughout but it seems as though these effects are favoured over any kind of strong story. The plot is almost a secondary product of the feature and any enjoyment taken from the film disappears when you begin to think about what is happening. Storm Reid in particular as well as the other child actors stand out among an array of phoned-in and annoying performances from their elders.,A Wrinkle in Time,3073
negative,"  This is an honest opinion of The Last Jedi, it had great effects and some amazing fight scenes, but that is the only positive I have. Luke was a terrible character, not at all who he should have been.

negative,"  This is an origin movie between the Assassins and the Abstergo Templars. And the Assasin's name is Bruce Wayne.SPOILERS:I didn't want to write ""SPOILERS""... since the movie already ruined it for you at the beginning by mentioning the existence of Himiko and Yamatai island anyway...But...Faithfully? Really? After they change the motive of Himiko from a villain with a desire to be reborn to a savior to keep deadly virus out? The huge take of the game was on supernatural phenomenon of how Himiko can control weather, summon mythical creatures or transfer souls ceremonially. Yet, instead, the director came up with what he thinks that make sense to him and invent a disease for the sake of the potential of making it into a bioweapon - just to introduce Trinity ( for sequel purposes ). The whole supernatural thing were being mentioned all movie long yet completely ignored at the end of the movie. This movie is a disaster - I am indignant that such a good origin story of Lara Croft wasted on the needs of being logical. Lara ending up fighting against trinity is analogues to Ezios against Abstergo. In fact, this would make a great AC Origins movie. Oh yea, btw, Lara is rich because of her dad's inheritance (thus the Bruce Wayne part).Speaking of being logical, the decision made by Clara wasn't so sense-making: in the scene in which Lara tried to stop the Trinity guy from escaping with the Virus, while the villain was on the step ladder that connects the cliffs, Lara chose to jump along onto the ladder rather than to remove the ladder so then the dude would just fall into the abyss (chasm of souls). One might argue that she didn't want to take lives... Yea, do a body count of the people died on her arrow tip as she went to steal the radio walkie-talkie. Absolutely ruined the scene that toughened her up by the waterfall and her first kill near the cave. She is just a daddy's girl towards the end.",Tomb Raider,9830

They keep making a copy of the original storyline, they spin it, switch it, repaint over it, but it's a poor choice nonetheless. The jokes seem misplaced, known characters seem out of character, and the new characters are not given anything to work with.Daisy Ridley is a treasure, and again they misuse her, wasting an incredible opportunity.One thing they do right is female representation, all movies of all genres should look like TLJ in that regard.However as a Star Wars flick, it's poor.",The Last Jedi,609

There is no continuation from The Force Awakens and the plot takes you on an illogical roller coaster ride, jumping from one scene to another, just to leave the last one hanging by a thread full of unanswered questions. Too many scenes were unnecessary and the entire lore of the Star Wars universe is replaced with something I cannot even explain.

It was like Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory except without any heart or moral to the story.To say I'm disappointed is an understatement-and here I thought 'The Last Jedi' was mediocre.

Practically no effort is put into generating special-effects that are warranted for blockbuster fantasy adventure and any concept (or quote) that had the slightest bit of humor to it, was widely broadcasted over the inordinate trailer.

Parts of the book that are well explained because they are important to the story are just skipped over in a 2second voice over. There is no real explanation about what or why things are happening but hey I just say chuckie and a ninja turtle so who cares! As a product of the 80's, I felt that nostalgia as well but a Delorean and t rex only work if the movie is actually interesting. Spielberg did this movie probably because he only had to shoot a couple days of actual live acton and the rest is CGI. If you thought Jurassic World was great, go see this.",Ready Player One,1076

Most of the deleted scenes in the DVD should have been included in the movie. Ruin Reylo Johnson is an arrogant snobby self righteous novice filmmaker and bad writer.

Whether your family deals with life-threatening food allergies or not, you will want to skip this waste of time unless you are interested in showing your family a ""how-to"" guide to being a bully. If you don't think kids follow the examples they see - like the sweet little bunny main character here - because ""come on, kids are smarter than that"" then I give you two words: Tide Pods. In this movie, said cute bunny intentional attempts to kill another character by forcing a deadly allergen in his mouth. And it almost works. How is this funny to anyone? Kids with these conditions didn't choose to have to deal with fear with every bite they eat just as much as kids with cancer or autism didn't choose their conditions. Yeah, it's just a movie BUT IT'S A KID'S MOVIE. These stars, producers, directors, studio execs should be totally ashamed of themselves for perpetuating this junk. SKIP THIS FILM.",Peter Rabbit,8078

negative,"  This movie believes that being deep is best accomplished by being boring and ambiguous. It has a simplistic plot and inner conflict better suited for an action movie, but trades entertaining special effects for eye-candy special effects that we're all sick of seeing by now. I will not spoil the film by revealing the central conceit it is trying to get across, but I will say that its main idea is utter nonsense, and something I would have expected to show up in one of those teen dramas that pretends to be deep at some point in the third act. Portman phones her part in, and no one else is much better. The camera makes bold moves for the sake of making them and never really asks whether the move was necessary. It's boring, it's long and it ultimately gives a moral that would be laughed off a fortune cookie. One of the worst movies I have seen all year.",Annihilation,4096
negative,"  This movie contrasts too many ideas that conflict with one another. He's an animal, okay. No, wait, he's intelligent, so he's humanized. Okay. No, hold on, he ate a cat, and I can't hold him responsible because he's a wild animal after all. Wait, cancel that, he's still humanized enough for sex... Oh wait, GODLIKE. Because what this story really needed was ""I can heal myself-ex-machina"".There are just other movies that handle the concepts attempted to be explored here, such as in Amelie. It just feels like the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, evidenced by some characters becoming completely irrelevant by the end, and much of the story not being fleshed out in exchange for a badmy written romance (which is ruined as soon as the cat scene shows up).And I can't even give credit to the design of the creature, because there's like, 5 things already in fantasy that look way too similar for coincidence. Watch another movie, this one isn't worth it.",The Shape of Water,9114
negative,"  This movie deserves zero stars. It is incomprehensible how Sony can joke about a life threatening medical condition, especially in a children's movie. Would they joke about slipping sugar to a diabetic person causing them to go into a diabetic coma and die? This is not about political correctness or parents being snowflakes. Food allergies can and do kill. And an epi-pen does not always stop anaphylaxis.

negative,"  This movie doesn't even merit 1/2 Star, but it's the least I could give it without looking like I forgot to give it a star rating. I've been a Star Wars fan for 33 years, but this movie has officially killed the saga for me. Politics, animal rights, and child abuse commentary combined with terrible acting, dreadfully worthless story lines, and dialogue such as ""we won't win by fighting what we hate, we'll win by saving what we love"" make for 152 minutes of eye rolling. This movie stars Luke Skywalker playing the role of Mark Hammil, as well as a cast of totally forgettable supporting actors with no chemistry. Go home Star Wars, you're drunk.

negative,"  This movie doesn't just have plot holes. The entire movie IS a plot hole. As a Star Wars fan since I was maybe 3 years old it just makes me sick what they have done with this series. The problems really started with The Force Awakens, but while that movie had issues, this sequel takes a nose dive right into the ground. The four young main characters of the film are Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren. Each of these characters is effectively ruined by the end of the film. Rey, as the Force-user of this series, doesn't really need any training. In The Force Awakens she picks up a lightsaber for the first time and defeats Kylo Ren with it. This would be like Luke defeating Darth Vader in A New Hope. But anyway, we are told throughout The Force Awakens that Rey needs to find Luke who is missing. Why? To get trained, we assume. The entire first movie is a buildup to the cliffhanger scene at the end where Rey meets Luke, and then the film rolls to credits. Yet in The Last Jedi, Luke doesn't train Rey at all. She accomplishes nothing while she is on the island with Luke, except for the fact that she is able to connect with Kylo Ren through the Force, which is one of several Force-powers that we, as an audience, have never seen before. Poe is emasculated in this film. He's supposed to be the Han Solo of this series but he is told he is making bad decisions time and time again by the female leaders of the resistance. Finn might as well not have even been in the movie. He is treated right off the bat like a joke. After trying to heroically save Rey and nearly being cut in half at the end of The Force Awakens, we see him walking around half naked in a water balloon. Because why? I guess it was supposed to be funny. He then spends the rest of the movie running around with this new character Rose on a fool's errand, trying to find some device that will do something to help the Resistance ships escape the First Order because the First Order has some tracking device that blah blah blah blah. Its all a big plot device that doesn't make much sense and doesn't matter anyway by the end of the movie. Finn and Rose also spend time on a Casino planet saving a bunch of anime-horses from being abused while at the same time leaving a bunch of children in slavery. They could have saved the kids from slavery and left the horses but instead they went with saving the horses. Near the end of the movie, Finn has a chance to save the Resistance by destroying this big cannon that the First Order is going to use against the Resistance. He attempts a suicide run but is stopped suddenly by Rose. Because why? I have no idea. Her stopping his suicide run made no sense. Now the First Order is just going to kill them all, right? As far as she knows anyway. Also they're having this little love scene right in front of the First Order. Why the First Order didn't kill both Finn and Rose right there I have no idea. Kylo Ren, and really the entire First Order for that matter, are no longer threatening villains. Kylo was defeated by Rey (who had no training) in the first movie, so why should we as an audience feel threatened by him? Same goes for General Hux. In this opening scene of the movie, instead of having an impressive battle sequence, the director of this film opts to have a joke scene where Poe calls Hux and plays some kind of phone game with him, and Hux falls for it. This is supposed to be funny but its not. What it does is basically render Hux a non-entity. We no longer care about him or are threatened by him after this. Captain Phasma? Another wasted character. She shows up for 30 seconds and dies. They bring Admiral Ackbar in just to kill him off screen. If Admiral Ackbar had been the one to do the suicide run with the Resistance ship instead of Admiral Holdo, it would have mattered. We care about Ackbar. We don't care about Holdo. But they killed Ackbar off screen. The entire sequence with the First Order chasing the resistence fleet makes no sense. Why doesn't the First Order just hyperspace jump in front of the resistance fleet? Why don't they send starfighters to kill the Resistence fleet? Why does the Resistence just send everyone out on transports like Finn and Rose did? None of it makes any sense. Not sure why Leia was in this movie either. We see her using the Force for the first time to save herself from space. Here's two problems with that scene. One: she uses the Force to get back to the ship, but how does she get into the ship through the door without killing everyone inside it? Two: if Leia was so powerful with the Force, why doesn't SHE train Rey? Why does Rey have to go find Luke if she's already got a powerful Force-user right there who can train her? Not that Rey gets trained by Luke at all anyway. The saddest part of this whole movie is Luke. Luke is the hero of Star Wars. Luke risks everything in Return of the Jedi on the belief that he can save his father, Darth Vader, the second most evil guy in the universe, from the dark side, and he succeeds. Why would this hero then turn around and try to murder his own sister's son in his sleep just because he sensed a little dark side in him? Luke would never do that. Never. He also would not hide on an island while that same nephew murders Han Solo and blows up a planet with the Starkiller death star thing. The Luke of this movie is basically a coward. What this movie has accomplished is that it has essentially rendered the sequel trilogy null and void. There is no reason to continue with Episode 9. None of these characters matter anymore.",The Last Jedi,53

It's no better than any of the Spiderman or Fantastic 4 films - in fact some of the CGI and most of the script is very subpar.

Their legacies get completely trashed. The movie tried so hard to be artsy and deep, but did it so blatantly obviously that all it wound up being was deeply annoying. The plot is a complete mess with random tangents all over the place that don't serve to progress the movie or characters at all. It was disheartening to see how some of my favorite characters were portrayed in this film, and the sad thing is that this can now not be undone. I don't know how this screenplay got the green light from Disney, but this movie has effectively ruined Star Wars for me and a lot of other people I know. I will likely never watch another Disney Star Wars movie after this one because I frankly don't care anymore.

I presume that this was to show the brutality of the character, but all is it does is make it more ridiculous that he doesn't kill Lu Ren when he tries to kill like all the guards with a shovel.

negative,"  This movie is only slightly related to the book - same character names and a mutilation of the basic story outline. The book wasn't perfect and was tedious in its obsessive documentation of 1980s pop culture. However, it had story and plot elements that made up for that. Everything that was thoughtful and good about the story and the plot was removed or altered dramatically, and none of those changes were for the better. The movie version didn't even attempt to be logical or follow a coherant narrative path. The acting was painful to watch and seemed like it was geared towards 5 year olds and yet pointless extra sexuality was added to the story. This is a movie that caters to the lowest common denominator. Yes it has great special effects. It's a roller coast movie. If all you want is mindless visual effects, if you enjoy watching other people play video games, then this is a movie you might appreciate.

negative,"  This movie is overrated as fuck. The CGI looks like ass and most of the dialogue is inconsequential to the story. I thought the mish-mash of African cultures was distracting (I can only assume some white studio executive approved it all without knowing much about the cultures themselves), and the vibranium was a plot device with no limitations that just made the main characters immortal, therefore all the fight scenes had no real stakes, and fixed all the other problems in Wakanda. The movie failed at being a good superhero movie, because there weren't enough fight scenes and the one ones we got we mostly CGIfests that weren't that interesting, and it didn't work as a political drama either because the forces superhero themes distracted from a political and emotional connection, and the ideas of racial injustice were watered down. It didn't help that it was all implied either; there is no scene detailing the racial tension anywhere in the movie, which could have added some more compelling narrative as opposed trying to establish T'Challa as ruler or whatever (which took way too much time in the movie). I would have liked to see Kilmonger's story expanded because he was the only good part of the movie. His backstory and personality were interesting but underdeveloped. I think it would be really fun to see him succeed and get the vibranium weapons out of WakandaThis movie had a lot to improve on. It wasn't terrible but all of you fanboys piss me off because this movie isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. ""It's representation of black people in mainstream culture that we haven't seen before""I'll give you that, this is an important cultural moment.

My position is that if you don't want to do the book on film, but want to use the characters, fine. buy the rights to the characters, write your own story and make a movie.

negative,"  This movie reminds me of boxcar kids in a fantasy world, which is not complimentary.Pros: Good messages. Power of love is pretty cliche, but liking yourself is important. The visuals are stunning. The actors are quite good, especially for child actors. Actually, all the acting is pretty good.Cons: So if this were a movie for adults, the plot holes would be unforgivable. Nothing that happens makes sense and the made up rules don't stick around long enough to be kept track of. Every character trudges along as though the plot fairy has a string tied to them, with no sense of motivation. Again, I get that it's a kids movie but could you at least try to build something resembling a story and not just a bunch of excuses to show off special effects?Overall: Not terrible, but definitely not good.",A Wrinkle in Time,2980
negative,"  This movie ruined going to the movies for me. I have never written a review on rotten tomatoes before but if my review stops even one person from going to see this horrid film, then it is worth it. I used to feel bad about those in the film industry lamenting how they can no longer make money. If you are going to put out this garbage then your industry deserves to fail. Wrinkle in Time is a good book, why not just follow the story line and do less with special effects. The premise didn't make sense, the dialog was preachy and also made no sense. Even my children who watch utter garbage thought this movie was awful. Just the worst movie I have ever seen. When movies cost close to $100 for a family of 5 to go to, they have to be better than this. This may be the last time I take my family to the movies for awhile.

I would say I'm surprised by the movie's high rating, but I'm not.

negative,  This movie was honest to god the most disappointing and least interesting Marvel movie I have ever seen. I feel this movie could have easily have been more interesting if they just spent more time on it. Black Panther is one of my favorite superheroes and when I watched Civil War I wanted to see more of the MCU version but I feel this movie took the amazing Black Panther from Civil War and made him boring. Also the movie is filled with deaths you don't even care about. *Spoilers* I feel Forest Winikers character was completely wasted. He got like 5 boring minutes of screen time and I feel like we were actually supposed to care about his death meanwhile I didn't. Also I feel the dialogue was a little out of place to. Especially when Forest Winiker was talking to Black Panther about how his dad created Kilmonger. Also I hated the constant switch in language from Wakandan 2 English. It made the movie overall confusing and hard to follow. This movie was overall disappointing and I found BvS more intereseating than this.,Black Panther,2858

From my eyes I see a movie that had a clichÈ beginning, a confusing climax, and a ending that was uninteresting because of the terrible antagonist plus the rush at the end to kill the darkness then get everyone home. a very big problem I had was that they had so many close up shots instead of focusing on the beautiful scenery and really make us feel that we are in this place like we are also in the story.

But the story was lacking suspense. Big Time. Also the ""big meaning"" behind this movie wasn't that hard to find out. So to but a movie like that with amazing visuals to netflix is the wrong decision. It would have definitely benefited from the big screens and surround sound of the theater.

Compare it to Coco...yeah I'm a gringo, but I learned a lot about and discovered new respect for the Day of the Dead ritual. The concept of the remember me song and being forgotten was amazing.

negative,"  This review contains plot spoilers. The Last Jedi is a terrible movie. It features a disjointed and illogical plot, and destroys the central character of the entire saga. The film opens with the First Order engaged in a space battle with The Resistance. The heroes are stymied because somehow the bad guys can track their hyper space jumps, and therefore appear within moments after the good guys have thought that they made it to a safe location. Down to just enough fuel for one last jump the heroes lead a slow speed chase through space with the First Order in pursuit. Yet why does the First Order pursue them? They could simply jump through hyperspace to locations in front, to the sides, below and above them. They would be hemmed in, and quickly destroyed. This type of illogical storytelling is the very essence of The Last Jedi: the movie tells the audience something half baked, and expects them to go along blindly. Finn is once again portrayed as a selfish coward who will cut and run at the first sign of danger. He is caught in the act of escaping by Rose who threatens to have him imprisoned for desertion. Is that something that the resistance does? I was under the impression that the rebels in Star Wars were there because they wanted to be there. No one threatened to imprison Han Solo when he collected his reward, and left the rebellion in the lurch in A New Hope. Seems like a First Order thing, but who cares? Logic is optional.  Finally at the end of the movie Finn sees that there are causes worth dying for as the First Order takes aim at the last refuge of the heroes with a mini Death Star weapon that will rip their fortress open, and be the end of all organized rebellion to the evil in the galaxy. He aims his ship at this weapon preparing to sacrifice himself to save the future. And then Rose rams him out of the way in an incredibly selfish act that she claims is to save those she loves. What about all of the people in the fortress that are now doomed? And where will she and Finn escape to now that she has destroyed both of their vehicles, and allowed the First Order to destroy their only safe haven? Not great at the long term thought, Rose. Again pesky logic makes this movie difficult to enjoy The treatment of Luke Skywalker is an abomination, and insult to every true Star Wars fan. Luke admits that he crept into Ben Solo's room to read his mind as he slept in order to ascertain if he was turning to the dark side. This nocturnal espionage yields compelling evidence that the young man is indeed headed down the dark path. At this point Luke momentarily decides that the best course of action is to murder his nephew in cold blood. He quickly thinks better of this course, but not before the younger Solo wakes to see Uncle Luke standing over him with a light saber in his hand, and a murderous glint in his eye. This causes the youngster to attack Luke and kill his loyal Jedi apprentices. In The Return of the Jedi a much younger Luke surrenders to Darth Vader, because he believes that, in spite of all of the atrocities his father has committed, there is still good in him. At one point in his confrontation with Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine Luke loses control and viciously attacks his father, because Darth Vader discovers the existence of Leia by reading Luke's mind. After Luke cuts off his father's mechanical hand he comes back to himself, and throws his light saber aside. This nonresistant tactic ends up causing Vader to truly have a change of heart. Now we are supposed to believe that Luke Skywalker is a cold blooded murder. He doesn't attempt to talk to Ben. He just thinks of killing him. Luke would never do that. Not even momentarily. That is not Luke Skywalker. And this movie is not Star Wars. It's an ill conceived cash grab that assumes that Star Wars fans are morons that spout billions of dollars for zippy laser shows. It's calculated and manipulative trash.",The Last Jedi,305
negative,"  This review is full of spoilers. You have been warned. We all remember that amazing feeling. We get home from school, run into the living room, boot up our console and wait for our favorite game to load. As it turns on, we get ready to battle, and the game lets us know it's time as those familiar words flash before our eyes: ""Ready Player One.""You would think a movie that was called ""Ready Player One"" would at least include those beautiful words the very first time our protagonist, Wade Watts, logs into the Oasis, right? Well, not so much.In a movie literally called Ready Player One, there wasn't much emphasis on actual gaming. This is the very first place where this movie goes so terribly wrong. Alright, but let's back up a bit. Ready Player One is based on the best-selling Ernest Cline novel of the same name. This dystopian book is set in a post-apocalyptic America in the not so distant future. The basic background we get at the beginning of the book is that our world has gone to shit. In the year 2044 the world has been facing an energy crisis for decades that was caused by global warming, overpopulation, and the depletion of fossil fuels. Basically, the world was destroyed by...humans. Rather than doing something to fix the problems they caused, humans escaped into a world of virtual reality, and began to live, work, and even get married to people they have never actually met, all inside the MMORPG called, The OASIS. The world is going to hell, but the OASIS is actually fairly stable. The OASIS has its own government, where Wil Wheaten is President, and the OASIS currency is actually much stronger than any you could get in real life.However, things get interesting when James Halliday, the reclusive creator of the Oasis dies, leaving behind no heir to inherit his vast fortune, and control of his company and all of the OASIS. So, Halliday leaves behind an Easter Egg in his game. Anyone who finds it, will win his entire estate, and the right to run the OASIS.The problem is, the company IOI is after the OASIS for profit. Nolan Sorrento, IOI's CEO, wants to make players charge for the right to access the OASIS. Since the world has basically been destroyed and a very small percentage of people control the world's tangible wealth, the only good thing most people have in their lives is the OASIS.Okay, so why I am giving you this vast background on the book? It's to highlight one of the biggest problems in the film adaptation of the novel. THERE ARE STAKES. The action of this story is fueled by the fact that if IOI gains control of the OASIS there will be no more reason for most of the world's population to even want to keep living. Most people work inside the Oasis, so if they have to pay a monthly fee just to get to work, what chance do they ever have of getting ahead? In the book, most people are starving because there is literally not enough food left on earth. This novel is brilliant, but I obviously knew there was absolutely NO WAY this movie would be able to replicate the epic quest laid out in the books pages, but I had really hoped that the spirit of the story would remain intact. In fact, I couldn't find anything in this movie that reminded me of the source material. There are serious spoilers ahead, so continue reading with caution.In the book, it was important to Halliday that a student find the first key. He wanted a regular person to begin this journey, so to start the movie with Wade already being this amazing Gunter, with amazing weapons, and a freaking DeLorean immediately made me feel like I wasn't connected to his character. He was clearly not a regular guy. Also, making Wade, Aech, and Art3mis go to school adds that human element that is missing from the film. People still have to have lives. They have to go to school or work. I mean yes, they go to school in the OASIS, fine. But they still have the expectation to do the boring monotonous things in life. It would have made the movie feel more real. It also, again, would have added additional stakes. ""I can't find the egg and save the OASIS from IOI until I finish school, otherwise I'll get kicked out of school and lose my internet access, gloves, and goggles to access the OASIS.""Also, I felt cheated that the movie picked up in the middle of the hunt. They dismissed whoever it was that figured out the first clue was a race...except.... how did they figure it out? It made NO sense that it would be a race based on Halliday's first clue, and it felt like cheating to skip over that.Then there is the fact that the spirit of the quest was completely altered in this adaptation. The quest itself should have felt like an adventure, but it was just a series of random events that led to a key. I mean, I obviously wanted to see Parzival Joust for the key against Acererak - but if that wasn't possible in the movie for whatever reason couldn't we have at least flavored the challenge to be similar? Spielburg used a flashy car chase because he wanted to be flashy. It wasn't about storytelling, it was about special effects. The quest for each key felt so lazy and figuring out the challenge was so easy for everyone that once again, there were no stakes. I get it, it was a race to beat IOI, but it should have been about so much more.In the book, IOI has castle Anorak encased in the Orb of Osuvox for like a month while the other Gunters hurried to figure out the last clue and catch up, but Sorrento and his band of Sixers (Suxors, as the book called them which would have made for an entertaining addition to this movie) couldn't figure out how to use the key and get past the gate because it never occurred to people so greedy to work together. IOI only used the Cataclyst to blow up the planet after Parzival and his friends showed them how to open the gate. I mean, that's an actual reason why IOI would destroy so many of its own Avatars. It wasn't just because Sorerento was throwing a hissy fit. That's also high stakes. IOI had a month, alone with the key and they couldn't figure it out. Let's address some other issues with the movie. Firstly, how the hell was it so damn easy for everyone to find each other? Daito and Shoto are in Japan in the book, which gives a broader scope to the story. This isn't a book about America, it's a book about the world. Also, Wade would have NEVER just told all of his friends how to find the first key. It's so dumb that the movie copped out like that. It goes against everything his character stood for, which is why it made more sense that Daito and Shoto don't meet Parzival, Art3mis, and Aech until after they find the key for themselves. This is where the movie continues to lack a human connection. Life just doesn't work this way. People don't all just magically find each other, and the entire freaking world is not based in Ohio. It's just...ugh. Let's get to Arti for a minute. In the books, saving the OASIS is the most important thing there is. She kind of hates that Z just wants to take the money and run. She wants to save the OASIS so she can use the money, the power, and the resources to save the world. She wants to feed people, get them into safe housing, and clean up the streets. She fights off Wade's attraction because she cannot afford to get sidetracked. Even at the end, when they are in the same house, she refuses to meet him in person until one of them has the egg. It's too important to let her emotions compromise what she views as the fate of the planet. That's a great character. She is driven, smart, complex, scared...she is real. Arti in the movie is flat. She dumps Z, but then...just kidding, ""I was really just coming to find you all along."" The fact that they meet so early in the movie takes away something so beautiful. It takes away the longing, the fight for their relationship, and the eventual terror he feels when he finds out her life is in danger. Also, that whole, ""I'm gonna fall on my own sword and be captured because you are the only one who can save the Oasis"" shit she pulls in the movie is so dumb. She would have been like, ""try to keep up, fool.""And why does EVERYONE just bow down to Wade and act like he is the only one who can win for the entire movie? I mean, racing against the Sixers is good, but why can't you also be racing against each other? It just would have made a much more interesting story.Getting back to my argument that there were no stakes in this movie, let's talk about Daito for a moment. His death in the book changes the entire dynamic of the hunt, and the race to beat the sixers. Daito dies, IRL, at the hands of IOI and that changes everything. I mean, we already knew Sorrento was capable of this, but for him to actually murder a member of the High Five is a wakeup call. It changes the way Wade views the entire quest and is probably what makes him allow himself to get arrested by IOI (under a fake name) and use his resources as an ""employee"" (with the help of some sweet hacker backdoor codes) to take down the Orb protecting Castle Anorak. Speaking of which, how the hell was it so easy to get out of IOI? I mean, Arti got her detector and alarm off easily enough...fine. Let's ignore that. But then she breaks into Sorrento's office unnoticed, gets out just as easily, then goes into the IOI war room, kills other sixers USING A SIXER AVATAR, and nobody thinks to take off their damn helmet and find the Sixer who is killing them all? Also, literally everyone is looking for her and they don't realize she is still inside IOI headquarters. You got drones that can find a dude with a face tattoo in five minutes, but you don't have security cameras in your headquarters? Seriously? Also, she is in a Sixer Suit, using a Sixer account, wearing a Sixer uniform. So how do we see her inside the Oasis as her own avatar. That is ridiculous. This is where I will address the movie fails in even following its own rules. Early on, it is established that to run and move your own body in the Oasis, you need a Haptic Suit. So how the hell are people just running around in the streets in Cleveland, wearing regular clothes, but still somehow shooting at everyone in the Battle for Castle Anorak? It makes no sense.Also, I challenge you to run around a busy street, with your eyes covered, pretending to be battling someone, and not get yourself run over by a bus. This is not real life, people. I think the actors were fine. They seemed well cast and may have been good if they had been given better writing. I mean, come on with this one. ""I won't be like Halliday. I'll jump."" Wade says, as he kisses, Samantha. I mean...really? That's the best you have. My friend groaned out loud in the theater with that one.The actor who played Halliday did a nice job, and so props to him, but Simon Pegg was painfully under utilized as Ogdon Morrow. I think I would have given the entire movie a break if they had allowed him to be the one who saves Z and Arti in the nightclub by using his overly strong, immortal OASIS avatar, ""The Great and Powerful Og."" That scene in the book was amazing and was 100% the reason why I was excited about Pegg's casting in this film. Also, I liked that it was Og who got the kids to safety in the end. He was so disgusted at the evil way IOI was twisting Halladay's challenge, that though he wouldn't interfere with the game, he also wouldn't let the kids get murdered. Stakes. We keep coming back to that. I wanted to like this film. I really really wanted to, but in the end, I didn't enjoy it at all. It focused 100% on special effects and failed where movies matter most: In the telling of a story and creation of characters the audience actually cares about.",Ready Player One,972

negative,"  THIS WAS A FANTastic sci-fi premise, but was unfortunates poorly executed by all parties. The direction seemed completely absent. The script was an embarrassing amateur hour of clunky exposition, unmotivated outbursts, and bland characters. I didn't care about any of the characters. They were so generic and poorly drawn. Natalie Portman gave the worst performance of her career. IT wasn't WAS truly awful. THe only one of the female scientist that seemed to Ben able to emote and show even a little depth was the very minor character of the physicist. All of the big parts, from the older woman to the fake hot-tempered one, were just outlines. It was like a boy band - she's the hot one, she's the smart one, she's the badass, she the sensitive one. In addition to these faults, the movie was long and slow and quiet. The CGI was amateur as well. The story after the premise wasn't laid out was hard to follow. There were plot holes everywhere. There were unmotivated actions and responses that were no credible. This was a terrible waste of time. But it was inspiring.

negative,"  This was a mind-numbingly awful film with only one redeeming quality....the credits. It is unclear what film other critics watched in order to give this tedious collection of disjointed scenes the rating they gave it, but perhaps they too spent too much time in the 'Shimmer'. Spoiler Alert: That is what they called the slowly spreading anomaly resulting from the meteor strike that opens the film. The only thing moving slower than the anomaly was the acting and the actual film itself. The statement ""exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll"" can only mean we will eventually realize the fact that we enjoyed the popcorn more than the film.",Annihilation,4513

The movie starts off well enough but very soon (with in 10 minutes) takes a nose dive into a world of plot holes, political non scene and a complete disrespect for the story told before it. I'm not going to talk about the weak characters or pepper thin plot, that has already been done. Let's instead talk about the horrable treatment of legacy characters. Who are these people??? Luke would never act the way he did. Leia was a non factor. Chewie was pointless..... yada yada.... look I'm not passing judgment on you if you liked this movie and to be honest I didn't hate it.

negative,"  This was a subpar cliche action flick that just happened to be called Tomb Raider. It was so loosely based off the games and the story of Lara Croft that it felt like it ripped the franchise off. If you havent ever played the new games then this may just be another ok action flick to you. However it was untrue to the story and spirit of Lara Croft.Alicia Vikander was the best part of the film. Everything else was either ridiculous or just meh.

A hard boiled egg obsessed masturbating mute who is frequently nude (in her home), whether it is her morning bath (masturbation time) or when she's having intimate relations with the mer-man....So much unnecessary nudity, it did NOT make the movie better in any way. I decided to watch the movie in its entirety because there were parts of it that made it seem that the story line would get better, but then...NOPE...over and over. The synopsis description and all the award nominations make this movie appear to be sensational, but in reality it is not. I was truly disappointed and left the theater laughing at how ridiculous this movie was and what a waste of time and hard earned money.",The Shape of Water,9376
negative,"  This was absolutely a waste of time. This movie jumped around so much that it has to be one of the most difficult movies to follow for anyone who has ever had the pleasure of reading the book. CGI alone will drive you mental. The camera angles screw up your eyes, I don't recommend sitting anywhere but the back row this movie or you will get sick. You must have to really enjoyed the book to fork over the cash to see this. If you want to have a fun drinking game, drink every time someone says the word universe, father or CharlesWallace. Seriously Charles Wallace as in one name the movie waste about 20 minutes of our time with that name alone. Charles Wallace come here, CharlesWallace I love you, CharlesWallace don't do that, CharlesWallace CharlesWallace CharlesWallace CharlesWallace. If you seen the trailer to this movie, you've seen the movie. There is not much else going on.

negative,"  This was easily the most disappointing movie experience I have ever had. Abrams did a fantastic job with The Force Awakens , creating an intriguing new story and developing meaningful characters essential the to the trilogy. However, all of that is nullified in this movie. The movie revolves around a sense of magical realism that only small children with no higher than a 1st grade education could find remotely plausible, even for a Star Wars movie. The director of The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson, is either the least qualified person on earth to direct a movie or he intended to decimate the characters and plot that were set up in The Force Awakens. He provided us a film with literally no significance or resemblance to the other movies, ruined the integrity of the franchise and introduced absolutely ZERO meaningful plot twists or sequences to set up the next movie. Disney should seriously consider making a another second installment to replace this atrocity as it would generate more revenue for them and provide Star Wars fans with a restored purpose to watch the third installment.",The Last Jedi,85
negative,"  This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen. It's as though Zak Penn and Steven Spielberg had a 5 minute conversation with Ernest Cline and forgot to take notes. The same key words can be found in both the book and the movie, however the plot has been twisted into nothing for the big screen and all of the magic lost along the way. Save your money and read the book. The nostalgia is plentiful and the story progresses at an appropriate rate to allow for exposition and to build tension. The movie? Took some ideas from the book, put them in a blender with corporate sponsors that are no better that IOI themselves and destroyed a beautiful thing.",Ready Player One,1773

negative,"  This was the worst star wars movie I ever seen! Rian Johnson it is very clear he is not a good writer and he needed a co-writer for the movie.

This is a very bad movie. Then they killed off Luke Skywalker, with an unreasonable reason projecting an image of himself kills him. Then they made Luke be a person who turn his back on the Force, and his friends and family. This image of Luke is hard to accept it like Captain American turn his back on America and start killing American citizens. Or like Superman turn his back on Lewis, and leave her to die when he can save her. The Last Jedi is the far worst Star Wars movie even though it had a big budget, and fancy visual it writing and plot fell through the roof. This why it has a low audience score. Then Finn in TFA Finn appeared he might be force senstive, why did he leave the first order what made him turn in TLJ this is ignored, and he was turned into a side character who did not even have no importance to the main plot. In the promotion of the Last Jedi they was showing Finn had a new blaster, he did not even use the blaster one time! Ouch!

In the sense I spoil how closely they follow the novel.The novel was a love letter to 70s and 80s and 90s pop culture. The film was not.I was curious how many of the references and related challenges could be used due to possible copyright laws. I'm guessing none of them because almost none of the original references were used which means none of the original puzzles made it to the screen.I can understand that some things have to be cut to be crammed into a 2.5 hour flick but this was more like a complete rewrite. And the rewrites in my opinion were dumbed down echoes of the charming cleverness of the original. On a good note the graphics were great, some of the added bits were funny.

negative,"  To be fair, I went into this film with blinders on. Despite my trepidation at this being a Sony Pictures release (the same studio that botched both the Chipmunks and Smurfs franchises multiple times), I was still riding the high of Paddington 2 and was looking forward to another film that would put a loving yet fresh spin on a classic British children's character. BOY, was I disappointed! So much crass, juvenile humor, poorly written characters, and disturbing changes from the original source material( certain characters are deceased that weren't in the original books and cartoons, the animals turning the manor into a frat house, etc.). Growing up with the TIMELESS BBC Beatrix Potter collection, it was very hard to see such an integral piece of my childhood being used for a cynical down season cash grab. I wouldn't even take young children to it. Show them the BBC version instead, it's far more interesting and takes its time with the characters (ironic for a 30 minute special vs. a two hour film), and the art style (which they shamelessly incorporated at parts here too) is a wonder to behold.

While it was visually stunning, thanks to amazing CGI support, the story telling left much to be desired.

I want to like anything with the brand name. This one, I can;t.First, Rose is on the same level as Jar Jar Binks. Not the actresses fault, just a poorly written story. The entire Fin & Rose arc was TERRIBLE. Fin was somewhat redeemable at the end when he attempts to sacrifice himself, which then gets foiled by Rose.The bombers in this movie are pathetic. Y-Wings would have been far better for the bombing run at the start. All the villains feel incompetent instead of clever. Not to mention, supposedly the First Order has been in the shadows moving so as to not attract attention, then in this movie they are apparently the unstoppable war machine.Rey is still a Mary Sue. Luke is a sissy. And talk about a slap to the face, we don't even get to see Luke mourn for his best friend Han Solo. Additionally, Luke isn't even Luke. You know, Luke, who risked all to save his father. In this movie, he tries to kill his nephew on a whim.What was that last battle? Sure, we'll throw the EU out. Then in Rogue One we show that Star Destroyers have the ability to hover above a city. But in this movie, the Star Destroyers can't enter the planet's atmosphere? One Star Destroyer could've destroyed the entire base at the end no problem.Nope, instead lets land a full mile away and slowly walk an attack force up to the door.This movie was pathetic. It wasn't even enjoyable. I'm not digging into EU concepts because Disney said they don't matter. Fine. At least make a movie that makes sense. This one didn't even fit with any of the past movies.

negative,"  Unfortunately, ""A Wrinkle In Time"" not only manages to fail of being a faithful adaptation to the books, but it also fails as a movie. It's cluttered, has some pretty horrible CGI sequences, and some pretty poor acting. A lot of them are okay, but it's tricky to have a movie rely so hard on kids, because if their acting is poor, the whole movie will feel that way. And sadly, some of them really miss the mark. It's not the worst movie of all time and it will have its fans, but it's too cluttered and ridiculous to match up to its best-selling source material.",A Wrinkle in Time,3006

They got awfully owned by the way better Force Awakens when it came to that Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. Ferdinand, on the other hand, attempts to become way better than Fox's latest attempt to bring the chipmunks back to theaters but that doesn't mean that Ferdinand is a second option to send children or basically the whole family just in case they have already seen the latest Star Wars movie. I just wish 20th Century Fox would just stop releasing movies like these on the same day as Star Wars gets released to theaters unless they can bring a way better movie that isn't juvenile like their latest attempts yet. Literally worth the shot once it becomes able for rent but don't expect to find anything that can hold this movie back from its score.",Ferdinand,6060
negative,"  Unfortunately, this movie is terrible. The script is weak, the acting is poor, and it is a otherwise a complete mess. It wants to be profound, but fails at every turn. It tries to throw in some pop culture references to seem hip, but they all fall completely flat. It tries to develop chemistry with the characters and to create emotional involvement, but comes nowhere close. Quite frankly, by today's standards, it isn't even that much to look at. I certainly wouldn't call it gorgeous. Aside from a few costumes, the aesthetics fail to deliver. In all, this is an extremely disappointing Disney effort.

negative,"  Vikander does what she can with this story. It's a shame the story doesn't amount to much. The movie tries something original through the first half giving you a close in view of the action, from the characters perspective instead of the typical 10,000 foot view where the story arc is clearer, unfortunately, as the movie gets into the 3rd act the director has done very little plot development and resorts to tropes and hand waving to get to an unsatisfactory conclusion.

negative,"  Visually a masterpiece, amazing costume design, CGI brings this comic book character to life with amazing imagery. Chadwick Boseman nails it as the central character Black Panther. The character must share ample time with green screen and other major battle scenes with Michael B. Jordan as Erick Killmonger his main rival.Wakanda is the home for T'Challa son of the slain king T'Chaka, who must take his rightful place leading his country. The council is a tribal group who advises and provides the backdrop to ensure the country remains strong.The areas where there is a certain amount of leverage in any comic book movies is the dialogue. At times I had trouble understanding what was being said. It also seemed to show the same close ups of the tribal council over and over as well as the ritual to become the Black Panther. It was tedious to watch and seemed like it was unnecessary. The action sequences made this worth the wait as the loyal Wakanda people battled the other factions led by Erik Killmonger changes the landscape to change the Vibrairum rich Wakanda to move to the entire world and kill all those who oppose.In summary great action movie with great scenery and a wonderful cast. Was it the best super hero movie no but am looking forward to the next. Keep pushing the envelope.",Black Panther,1969
negative,"  Visually amazing in many ways but this has to be the worst attempt at telling a Star Wars story I've ever seenThis is coming from a die hard Star Wars fan who grew up with the movies, video games, books, comics, toys, etc. The whole movie takes place over a span of like 10 hours and does nothing to advance the story. They basically took all the possibilities that TFA set up and threw them out the window. Like is now a coward and useless, Rey is the exact same as before, Kylo is always about to cry, Hux is the least intemidating villian ever, we never find out anything at all about smoke and OH! He's dead now. The entire adventure of Finn and Rose is pointless and just takes away from what's going on with the story. Rose is a completely pointless character who adds nothing. LUKE DIES FOR NO REASON. Leia flies through space. Chewie does nothing. Why doesn't Admeral Halsey just tell Poe or anyone that they aren't all going to die so they don't get involved with the stupid side quest that ends in resistance fighters getting blown up. BB-9E got hyped up and does nothing in the movie. The whole force image of luke that fights kylo is dumb and they both stand really weird the whole time. Rose saves Finn in the speeders by hitting him from directly sideways after she had already turned back and Finn was like 1,000 yards farther along than her. Yoda is great. Ports are great. Nein Nub survives so that's cool. Akbar is dead :(. We still don't really know about Rey's parents or how luke's lightsaber was found. How did the top just rip off of the AT-ST that BB-8 rode on?

negative,"  Warning!!! Spoilers ahead!OMG... Simply awful. Such a mish-mash of dumb ideas, stunted dialog, and horrible storytelling, I simply cannot believe they green lighted this script.My first problem, beyond the stunted dialogue, is how a ""King"" can possibly be in charge of one of the most technological advanced civilization in the world? Need I bring up the whole system of kingly succession where the king has to fight to be ruler??? No, really... That's the system of government... Kick the old kings ass and you get to be the Black Panther!!! It seriously sounds like something out of Monty Python and the Holy Grail: ""Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government""Second problem: Can someone explain why Claw, with the fake arm, was even necessary in this film? Why was the heist in the museum even central to the plot???Third problem: During the end scene, while the CIA agent was shooting down the transport aircraft, the only thing I was thinking of was, 'The poor pilots!' Yah, that's right! He shot the damn transports down and killed the pilots of the aircraft without giving them a chance to surrender or anything! WTF???Forth problem: There was such a mish mash of African cultures from all over the continent wrapped up into one small little invisible country all I could think of was, 'This must be how Walt Disney saw Africa...' Its seriously the equivalent of trying to depict North Americans by having some wear T-shirts, shorts, and saying ""ya'll,"", others waring suits and ties and talking about money, and mish mashing them all together in the same scene. It's not only insulting to African cultures, it's completely too dumb to make sense and shows a lack of vision from their art department...Fifth problem: The dialogue... OMG THE HORRIBLE DIOLOGUE!!! The only characters in this film that had good dialogue at all were the female characters! The male characters were so clichÈd and stunted, I seriously couldn't believe this movie wasn't released directly to DVD... In all, this was nothing more than an overpriced B movie without the B movie charm...ZERO!!! Stars! Avoid and wait for it on HBO or Netflix...",Black Panther,2679

Basically a lot of wasted opportunity on something that had the potential to be a lot more. Of course, to most of the critics who live for this type of stuff, it was brilliant.

negative,"  Watched A Wrinkle In Time today. It was literally the dumbest, most infuriating movie I have seen in my life up to this point. I was expecting science fiction and I got a cut-rate childrens movie that was mostly rainbows and childish whimsy wrapped in a tissue-paper thin layer of sci fi terminology. There is not a single character that I did not hate within five minutes of their introduction. I laughed at the big villain moment because I am not intimidated by five year olds. Itd a movie that attempts to be inspiring and insightful when it has nothing more to say than 'The hippies were right, love solves all the worlds problems'. I can't recommend it on the visuals because the only good visual effects scene was at the end of the movie and the rest of them look like they were done by interns. I can't recommend this movie to parents because the moral of the story - if you can call it that - is that if you just love hard enough, Daddy will come back and the bullies at school will be nice to you.For the love of God, capital G divine one-and-only God, do not take a child to see this mpvie. No child deserves to have this inflicted on them. No child needs even the barest hint of the thought that they can make Daddy come back or make solve other complex real-world issues just by loving at it hard enough, because if yiu convince a kid that and loving at it doesn't work, wellI guess that means you didn't love Daddy enough/I guess you're just not loving enough to be treated with basic human respect.I have a habit of being hyperbolic and exaggerating to make things more amusing but here, now, for thebfirst time in my life I am genuinely just this pissed off at something.

Sure the general plot was loosely the same but the characters were different and the competition was completely different. I felt like the screen writers based this movie off the cliff notes they read as this movie is not the same. Perhaps the kindest way I can describe it is that the movie was inspired by a conversation the writers had with someone they talked to who read the book. If I had not have read the book the movie would be a 4.5 out of 10 as the story was choppy and characters interactions felt forced.

negative,"  Welcome to the jungle...really? Is that the best they could come up with? How many movies have used that in one way or another now?So at the end of the first movie (in 1969) the board game Jumanji was thrown into a river by Alan Parrish; 26 years later (1995) its somehow ended up in France apparently. Fast forward to 1996 and the board game has once again been discovered...but back in America? (I trust that wasn't supposed to be the same beach from the first movie). Anyway the game has somehow evolved with the times and is now a videogame console; and once again it lures another unsuspecting youth into its jungle themed clutches. Fast forward again to 2016 and four students will also discover the board game which will trigger the same things that happened before. And round and round we go.So I gotta admit that I liked the idea that this mysterious game can somehow evolve with the times. Back in the first movie (1969) it was a board game to blend in with the era. Now its a videogame console which of course is perfect for this era. The whole idea of the protagonists choosing a game avatar to play as which then turns out to be their live action avatar once inside the game is pretty cool (although [i]Red Dwarf[/i] did it first). This does inevitably lead to very stereotypical characters which is deliberate...but doesn't excuse the stereotypical teenage protagonists which wasn't deliberate I'm guessing.Yeah so the teenagers, they're a straight 'Breakfast Club' type bunch for sure. You've got the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the weirdo. So yeah its a complete rip-off. I really felt like they could of done better with these characters despite the movie being full of deliberate cliches and stereotypes. As for the avatars they are also rather cliche, naturally. The Rock is of course just playing the same character he always does, basically himself. Jack Black is the squat, spectacled, old fashioned looking professor type. Kevin Hart is the goofy sidekick type. And Karen Gillian is Lara Croft essentially.One thing that did get me thinking was the in-game characters, the baddies and the in-game guide. The in-game guide and various baddie henchmen all seemed to act like actual videogame characters on rails. In other words they don't interact with the protagonists on a personal level, they just do and say what they were programmed. But some henchmen and the main villain (Bobby Cannavale as Professor Van Pelt, same name as the big game hunter from the first movie) seemed to not do this. It did seem like Van Pelt behaved differently and not in a programmed way like the others, almost as if he were a real person. Now in the original movie we never saw the jungle in the game, obviously this time we do. Alas its not really been visualised that well in my opinion. I always had the impression the jungle was set in an old fashioned British colonial type era mixed with a bit of [i]Tarzan[/i] type fantasy. Like the exterior of the board game indicates. Of course as the game evolved so did the interior jungle it seems. This unfortunately has led to all sorts of modern crap turning up like military choppers, motorbikes, modern guns and weapons, ridiculous chase sequences, and lots of explosions. Now I'm sure some people will have liked these elements but for me it totally ruined the entire feel of the movie, or at least the look and feel I was hoping for.Gone is the possibility of quaintness and charm, enter vast CGI chase sequences on-board a military chopper (being chased by man eating CGI rhinos. Why didn't they just shoot them?). Stupid chase sequences with hordes of motorbike riding bad guys. Lots of gunfire, explosions and of course the obligatory martial arts sequences from Ruby Roundhouse. I might add that Ruby Roundhouse spends lots of time trying to learn how to flirt and act sexy to distract some bad guys, but ends up just kicking the crap out of them. Her entire character is utterly pointless, why did we need all that shit when she can just beat them up. Its like one sequence where The Rock's character says he knows CPR but doesn't actually do it when its required. He just stands there and gives instructions to another character, eh??Its really such a shame that this movie went down the route it did. Obviously there was gonna be CGI involved, obviously there was gonna be greenscreen involved, but Jesus Christ could they not do any better than this?! Most of the CGI is bad, real bad. Most of the greenscreen is obvious, real obvious. In fact it gets noticeably worse towards the end in my opinion. There are barely any practical effects which the first movie did incorporate in places. This movie is just ugly from top to bottom and its not helped by all the ludicrous action sequences. Its like half the movie wants to be like [i]The Phantom[/i], and the other half like [i]Rambo[/i]. Its such a clash of genres and tone.There is also a large plot hole in the way this story works, I think, unless I missed something. In the original Alan Parrish goes back to the point where he started playing the game in 1969 and changes time. This is obviously meant that Judith and Peter would never have played (in 1995) and wouldn't know anything about the game or Alan (having never met him). In this new movie the protagonists meet up with the kid (Alex) who got trapped in the game from 1996. When they all leave Alex goes back to the point he started playing in 1996 and changes time. So if he changed time, how come the four main protagonists still remember everything when they get back to their present day of 2016? Surely there's a chance they would never have ended up playing the game, or the game wouldn't have ended up in the school (?).Anyway once again I find myself completely mystified by a modern movies success. How on earth did this pile of crap make so much money? How on earth did people find this enjoyable?? I could maybe understand it if this was an original movie and the first had never existed, but it does exist! I simply cannot fathom how anyone can accept this utter garbage after the excellent original movie (complete with a terrific Robin Williams) which came out back in 1995. There are some neat little touches here and there, I like the evolution and mystery of the game, and Jack Black is always a pleasure. But apart from that, this was yet another cookie cutter Dwayne Johnson flick. CGI laden trash of the highest order.",Jumanji,6122

And I even watched it in a 4DX cinema. In a normal cinema one might feel a bit of drag. 5/10 points. One can, if one owns a big screen, easily wait for it to come out on Blue Ray or cable TV.",Tomb Raider,9483
negative,"  Well, I just wrote a long review for this and then posted it, or tried to, before logging in. I then logged in, hit ""post"" without noticing that my carefully written review was gone, and now have to write it all over again. So here we go, take two:Black Panther did not catch or hold my attention from the very first scene. Even the music over the black screen as it faded in had me thinking ""Uh-oh. Well, it will probably get much better, so we'll give it the benefit of the doubt"". It never did. Instead, like a late night re-run of ""The A-Team"", I felt like I could have slept through most of it without missing anything. To be blunt, I thought it was boring.Other reviewers seem to think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, particularly within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I disagree, but it isn't the only time I found myself on the opposite side of the fence with a Marvel movie.The first time it happened was with Ang Lee's ""Hulk"", which I loved. It has things I don't like, but overall, I still enjoy that movie a great deal. The blend of music, cinematography, effects, and story, made me feel like I was watching the best of grand opera. But, it didn't perform well and the character was rebooted with Edward Norton playing Bruce Banner. I liked pretty much every scene that had Norton in it, but started disliking the movie when the Abomination was revealed as the villain. Not that I have anything against that villain, but I didn't like the way he was handled in that movie.More recently, I disliked all the political maneuvering in Civil War. Take that out, and I might have liked it. As it is, after seeing it more times than I care to admit, I still don't like it. Ragnarok was too jokey for my taste. Not that I don't like the humor in Marvel movies--usually I love it, but in Ragnarok, it made Thor the butt of every joke, and I didn't like that.The problem with Black Panther, at least, the problem I have with it, is that everyone connected to the film seems to have taken themselves so seriously that they stifled all the life from the film. It was like watching a DC movie, where the superheroes may as well be empty costumes for all the personality they have.Unlike others, I did not like Boseman as T'Challa, nor did I like him in ""Civil War"". It was one of the things that irritated me about the movie. Marvel has made some brilliant casting decisions, from Idris Elba as Heimdall, Chriss Pratt as Starlord, and Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury. How could they blow their streak of casting every Marvel superhero to date perfectly by giving us an actor who was so regal that the character lacked a personality and any discernible flaws?Add to this the claustrophobic sets, average cinematography, tedious story and editing, and the nonsensical mixture of tribal and futuristic culture, and this movie really falls apart.It was watchable in the sense that it didn't offend me (unlike ""the Manchurian Candidate remake, which I walked out on), but it could have been much more interesting if the filmmakers hadn't treated every aspect of this story like a Faberge egg they were afraid might break if they breathed too hard. The political content was sublimated more than expected, but it didn't bother me. I just wish they had let themselves cut loose and make something that was less safe.",Black Panther,2369
negative,"  Well, I read the books......this movie had nothing to do with them....totally changed it. Did not like it at all!",A Wrinkle in Time,3389
negative,"  Well, the movie is not bad, but being a Marvel flick it comes across a bit weak. Especially compared to the last one, Thor Ragnarok, it's incredibly weak. Sure, there are cool fighting scenes with spears (it's Africa, right?!) and even an OK battle, but as a whole it does not convince. Besides that, the visual quality when there are scene swipes from one side to the other is surprisingly poor, even perturbing your eyes (even more so in 3D or so). All in all, it's watchable, but nothing to brag about. 5/10 points.",Black Panther,2654

Plain and simple, the movie is a train wreck.",Annihilation,3879
negative,"  What can I say to add to this conversation? Firstly I want to say that I didn't have any fan theories going into this film, so that argument against those who dislike the film is invalid in my case. I've watched it a few times now and have thought a lot about it. I am a fan of Star Wars, but not a fanboy (am a big time Trek fan), but I love the original trilogy and The Force Awakens, but this really was a disappointing movie. In an attempt to subvert the expectations of the audience the director manages to have no ""payoff"" from anything that was set up in The Force Awakens, or for things that were set up in THIS movie. You read that right. This movie doesn't even pay off itself. It also doesn't set anything up for the next movie. All we can look forward to are characters who are mostly the same as they were before this movie began, and a hope that Luke Skywalker makes an appearance as a force ghost to do something epic. I find the path and the story of the current characters very superficial and uninteresting. I do not feel the same way as I did at the end of The Force Awakens where I was excited and looking forward to the next movie. There are multiple plots going along at the same time and really only the Rey and Luke plot was interesting to me. Much of what happens seems like filler and has little consequence on the plot. There were also some heavy-handed political messages, which distracted from the film experience for me, mainly because they weren't done well. I think this movie also suffers with re-watchability. After seeing The Force Awakens, there were several scenes I looked forward to watching at home on my TV, but with The Last Jedi, I am struggling to think of a scene I want to see again. Maybe the Luke/R2 scene, Luke/Yoda, or maybe the throne room battle. I guess I could just look those scenes up on YouTube and save myself 2.5 hours. I'm not ranking this movie low because I'm an upset fanboy, it just wasn't a very good movie. Aside from any Star Wars related missteps, which there are several, a movie that barely rolls along with lack-luster characters and no payoff from the beginning to the end, it just isn't a good movie. I am giving it a star and a half for good visuals and a few scenes that were done well.",The Last Jedi,465

negative,"  What to say about this film. I liked about half of it, and at different points. Maybe it's because it felt like 3 different movies during each act. I will try not to spoil the movie but will probably explain basic elements of each act to demonstrate my point. So the first act felt like your typical college film about a young 20-something year old woman trying to make ends meet while living in busy London. That was fun, funny, not tomb raider, but overall fine. Once the second act begins (the adventure) it tries to become this mysterious quest surrounding questions about Lara's father. Overall this part of the movie is boring, uninteresting, and predictable. And the second act feels like it drags on forever. But the third act is where we get actual tomb raiding and adventure/action akin to the video game series. Really liked the third act. So the movie was a rollercoaster in terms of quality. If you're a fan of the two new video games (like I am) you might like, but other wise it's not that good.

negative,"  When I first heard of this movie, I honestly figured it would be disgustingly bad. Now that it's out, I can see that it's nowhere near as bad as I expected. Still, that doesn't mean I necessarily like it.Jumanji is part of the new trend of disguising remakes as sequels. That, or it's a sequel disguised as a remake. Either way, it stands out from the original Jumanji in some ways and is strikingly similar I other ways. The characters, meanwhile, are more high school and action movie archetypes than characters. That makes it hard to get invested in them or take them seriously, until they get some perfunctory but welcome character development. Then again, taking them seriously isn't really the point. It's supposed to be a mindless fun. At first, I thought all of the camera movements would get in the way of that, but the cinematography hits that sweet spot of showing off the craziness without being nauseous. During the climax, the lighting similarly sets the mood without being so dark that you can't see what's going on.Jumanji's main appeal is seeing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart at work together. Co-staring in last year's Central Intelligence has given the pair good experience to build their chemistry off of. Still, that's not enough to refresh this movie's stale sense of humor. Most of the jokes are based on cliches, dumb, or telegraphed miles in advance. There are quite a few laughs to be had here, but there's no getting around how unfunny large chunks of the movie is, Since that's the core of the movie. Adventure-comedies are perfectly fine, but there are countless movies out there that do it better.",Jumanji,6218
negative,"  When I heard Ava was directing, I downloaded the audiobook and listened when I used to trek to work. I really couldn't get into the story, mainly because of the style of writing and the way the characters talked to each other. I never finished it. After seeing what I saw today I can only say that this particular story does not lend itself to adaptation easily. There are shots in this film that you'd see in an oscar nominated film which can only be created by Ava. But the surrounding story tries to drown it out. That being said, coming out of the theater I had the strongest desire to see a Wizard of Oz movie directed by Ava DuVernay. All of the elements and techniques were in this film to make the latter something special. Even keeping some of the same cast.I know this film was not for my particular demographic, and that it has a very important message weaved throughout. But a good movie needs a good script and when the book that script is based on is an acquired taste in itself, a universally loved product is a difficult goal.",A Wrinkle in Time,3814
negative,"  when I went in to see this film opening night I was excited to see Luke Skywalker return, I was ready to see space battles and lightsaber fights, I was ready to see a good movie. What I got was a MASSIVE disappointment the story was all over the place, Rey was a Mary Sue, the casino planet was unnecessary to the plot, Luke Skywalker dying enraged me, and the fact that the purple haired leader couldn't tell Po the plan because he was a hot shot is the worst reason I have ever heard of. The First Order's military leaders who are supposed to be a representation of the Nazi's who fled to South American and regrouped don't have any competent leaders in their ranks. Whats worse the comedy derails the plot on several occasions and hurts the serious tone that the movie is going for. Now a few subtle jokes from C3P0 and Chewbacca would have been fine but to have as many ""jokes"" that the movie did I thought I was trying to be a bad sequel to Space Balls. Also as this was the final film with Carrie Fisher I felt as though it would have been better if Leia died in the attack on the main bridge of the ship. It would have been a huge emotional blow to the audience and it would have had an impact on the characters in the movie, instead they pulled a Mary Poppins out of no where showing she has force powers that are equal to that of Luke despite the fact she never had any official force training, this turns an emotional death scene that would have surpassed the death of Han Solo and it would show that this movie had balls. Instead the film decided that ""Nope we are going to keep her alive for no reason other than the fact that we want her to live and kill Luke off because we want him t die."" I am disappointed with Disney and I am disappointed with Cathleen Kennedy as they should have written a better script and take a page out of the two previous trilogies for how to write a proper script.This movie is on the same level as a bad fanfiction. -10/10 will not buy the DVD or Blu-Ray, do not recommend anyone to see.",The Last Jedi,232

negative,"  WHERE TO EVEN BEGIN, THIS MOVIE tried to copy the plot of the tomb raider game from 2013 and failed. it was nothing but lazy writing as they copied himiko and yamatai straight from the game while still trying to add a twist to the story. These writers are nothing but talentless hacks because the story for both the setting and himiko were already taken and if they were going to put an entirely new spin on what himiko was they should have just made a new story. But they didn't, which shows you how pathetically untalented these people are. Some things to note: 1) They changed Himiko from sun queen to some goddess of death 2) they introduced an evil organization named trinity that seeks to control the supernatural, and that they hired mercenaries to get Himiko's power, which replaces the game's original idea of stranded madmen that knew that they were being kept on the island by an unnatural force and wanted to find an ancestral link in Lara's friend, Sam, in order to sacrifice Sam to Himiko so that they may be freed from the island (Long story very short).so they copied the game plot but removed lara's asian friend sam, which in the game, served to be the reason that lara pursued the villains of the island she was trapped on. Sam was taken and Lara, being a loyal friend went to save her; bringing Lara into direct confrontation with people trying to kill her and thus leads to the development of lara's fighting abilities. At first, she struggled with killing people, which was entirely reasonable as this is her first encounter with bad situations. The game lays out the foundation for Lara's development in both skill and character from the beginning, but the movie does not succeed in any character development of Lara at all. Instead, it was so condensed that we could hardly see a city girl develop into an explorer, and the main reason she went after the mercenaries was because her father was written into the script to be alive on the island and that he said some DISAPPOINTING things to her because she didn't burn his notes like he asked. Is that really the kind of motivation for a city girl with no background of violent encounters to suddenly risk life and limb and go toe to toe with ruthless mercenaries? no, it is not, and it's infantile and stupid.Next, we see the writers try to copy the game's original wound near Lara's hip, but that just makes the whole writing seem even more lazy. In addition, the ice axe was an important part of Lara's arsenal in the game, where Lara had to climb on multiple OCCASIONS and use it as a weapon as well. HOWEVER, the movie had decided to introduce it without Lara needing to climb anything serious at all. Instead it was brought out later (ALONG WITH THE USE OF THE BOW AND ARROW) as a marketing ploy to draw the connection to the game. Lara only used it once, and we didn't even see snow. There was no point for these mercenaries to have it at all, and out of all the weapons available, that was the most pointless one she could have picked. Next was her fight with the main antagonist, and she honestly threw her ice axe on the ground so that she could jump on a shaky ladder connecting the pathway into Himiko's chamber to the entrance of the cave so that she could go toe to toe with a trained mercenary. On this shaky ladder, she also decides to use plenty of kicks, which is stupid and pure nonsense. This might seem petty for a movie, but the whole point of the Tomb Raider reboot was precisely to be more realistic and show a vulnerable character grow into the explorer we all knew her to be, and neither the experienced Lara Croft, nor the inexperienced Lara Croft would kick someone while standing on a ladder hanging above their drop to the death. Of course, the whole fight scene was pointless as she drives the antagonist back from the ladder and in towards Himiko's cave only to kick the ladder down anyways. All of this pointless crap just to say the most eye-rolling catch phrases ever. Finally, their twist on Himiko was that there was nothing supernatural about her, that she was a carrier of a disease that killed anyone by her touch. Not only does this go against all the adventures of Tomb Raider, but unfortunately they introduced trinity as the organisation that seeks to control the supernatural; and they were active on Yamatai, looking for Himiko's power. So they introduce an organisation that seeks out the supernatural to increase their power and they merely introduce a disease, it simply doesn't work. Honestly, Richard's (Lara's father) description of trinity could be wrong, this would have been a nice twist, perhaps for a later installment after they introduced Trinity earlier on and actually introduced Trinity as an organisation that went after supernatural power only to uncover a disease; however, with a bare minimum introduction, the lazy writing and theft of the plot of the Tomb Raider 2013 game, I believe that the writers unintentionally contradicted themselves here. They are that bad. The writers should be fired for having no talent and sent to prison for their theft and destruction of a great story and character.",Tomb Raider,9527

I was DISAPPOINTED that the female characters were forced for political agenda. The only scene I enjoyed was the Praetorian Guards vs Rey and Kylo. Other than that I walked out of the THEATRE DISAPPOINTED, not because of debunked fan theories or because I feel ""threatened by women"" or because the main lead of the film is a female, but because it was a poorly written film which was too long with a storyline devoted to pointless casino scenes (which looked amazing, but the plot... not so much). The characters were dwindled down rather than progressing forward. Rey and Kylo have returned to square one plus Rose and Finn have a forced romance. In my opinion, Luke was out of character. You mean he would throw away a lightsaber of his fathers!? Which represents His Jedi lineage? Luke would never kill his nephew in his sleep!

negative,"  While this movie was good aesthetically from a story telling standpoint it was awful. The one star was for the visuals and the musical score. This movies fails for quite a few reasons:1. Characters act out of ""character."" Any half decent writer will tell you that when you write fiction that you need to know your characters intimately. Audiences can almost always tell when a character isn't behaving like they should. There runs rampant in the Last Jedi. It makes the movie unbelievable and insincere.2. Continuity. Its Evident that J.J. Abrams had direction he started this series on. Rian Johnson did not follow that road map. 3. In conjuntion with the first item Rian Johnson does not know how to write strong characters of any stripe or creed. He purposely weakend the established stronger characters like Luke and Leia so that newer characters can shine in their own right. He even weakened Poe and Fin. A story teller should never have to weaken any characters to make other characters stronger. They are not actually stronger...they only seem stronger.4. Rian Johnson basically burned the world to the ground. The Resistance is all but defeated and left without any strong leadership with the deaths of Akbaar, Leia, and Holdo. The whole of the Resistance fits in the Falcon. On the other side of things the First Order's back has been broken. Its largest assets have been destroyed(Supremacy/Star Killer Base) and Snoke has been killed. The First Order will be in a tough financial situation and it is leaderless. Neither Kylo Ren nor Hux is fit for leadership. From reading the novel most people in the First Order want to kill those two. It will eviscerate itself before too long.5. Building on the last item I really only see two ways of moving forward. the first and most practical reason is that it has to become 4 part series. the second option is to just redo the Last Jedi",The Last Jedi,802
negative,"  While this was dreamy from the start, with a lovely opening sequence, the overall film was a bit underwhelming and overly violent IMO, which was disappointing considering all the fanfare.",The Shape of Water,8531
negative,"  While Tomb Raider may have its appeal to the fans of the video games legacy, this new installment, just like in the past, fails in many areas, although not as badly. In particular, it comes short in it's somewhat meaningless plot and obnoxious action sequences. Additionally, the sound mixing could be better, there were parts of the movie when Lara Crofts (Alicia Vikander) grunts could be to clearly heard while she is running through the jungle and enduring gun fire. Junkie XL put together a decent original score, but even if it was as great as some of his other work like in Mad Max, it wouldn't be enough to bring this movie out of the tomb it's going to continue to bury itself under.",Tomb Raider,9513
negative,"  While visually and technically crafted at a high level, the plot was contrived, and new characters pushed forward at the expense of the older established characters.

negative,"  Who wrote and directed this piece of trash, To hell with Disney",The Last Jedi,676
negative,"  Why did I watch this movie? Oh yea because I have enjoyed watching comedic movies with a similar cast like Central Intelligence ok I just like Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart who is a really cool guy I hear is like a mini bonus(no pun intended). Aside from a random Vegas scandal to detour fans from actually enjoying the film for what it is did not mess up the buzz. Afterall this is a sequel 22 years after a cutting-edge and successful movie starring the Late Great Robin Williams. My fave character he portrayed of his was Genie from Aladdin, but I digress. Jumanji switches it up for the times so it's a video game instead of a board game? Ok well-played yet this is the shortest video game ever. Where are all the cut scenes and easter eggs and oh yea I forgot Jumanji morphed into a 16-bit console system which is lame. Then you use new actors who we've never seen before and then give us avatars of people who we know. I must admit Jack Black can't save this movie all by himself, because actors tried their best to play a character that was younger and not them full of flaws and all. Yea teamwork hooray but NO. This movie was not that funny at all. I can't laugh at Kevin Hart or other people dying and respawning. It got old before it got old. I know there are giant animals and chase them and it didn't seem like a fun video game. Now to the actors credit I know I've been hard on you and I'm sure the shoot schedule was rigorous and you didn't get a chance to develop your characters but the story didn't enable the characters to rise to the surface in any way shape or form. It's like ok Maps, thats your job. Ok Dance Combat and you're like wtf. The characters don't even seem like friends in real life and we expect to follow them on this adventure. This is unique in a sense because you usually don't have well known actors playing kids aside from Bruce Willis in the cartoon Bruno the Kid and Tom Hanks in Big. And aside from Rob Schneider alot of actors doing comedy bits don't have a woman trapped inside them. I'm sure there are more movies but humor me this is a Jumanji review not a film lesson. So if you wanna watch it you can and you may laugh and you may be like man this plot sucks but hey don't say I didn't warn you because the consistency is off and I was glad it was over then was like... I actually watched this",Jumanji,6559

negative,"  With all the Oscar talk and plagiarism controversy swirling around it, I don't know what I really expected out of this flick... It has Guillermo del Toro written all over it, undoubtedly, with a surreal atmosphere like a combination of ""Hell Boy"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" as well as a strong ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" vibe.By the way, the Universal Studios ""Creature"" trilogy of the 1950s is one of del Toro's favorite monster treatments, and it's one that he wanted to remake in his own style, but Universal rejected his repeated proposals for years.This movie, however, doesn't really adhere to the aforementioned influences; rather, it enters the realm of Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" with the same simplistic storyline: An intelligent (even ""magical"") monster is brought into a dreamy caricature of ""modern"" mid-20th Century civilization, where it manages to make both loving friends and brutal enemies and eventually escapes back to its remote origins once more.Yes, there is the much-touted love interest between the monster and a human female; but this is no more derivative than ""The Creature"" was derivative of ""King Kong"" or a dozen other films in which the monster falls for the girl. That's just a time-worn Hollywood trope.I suppose I expected to see the elements that made ""The Shape of Water"" worthy of an Academy Award nomination...and I came away disappointed, because I just don't see it as Oscar-worthy.Production-wise, ""Shape of Water"" is only so-so: the story is a Hollywood standard; the sets are colorful but not especially innovative; the great majority of the monster effects are just latex; the musical score is not particularly memorable; and the acting is only adequate.Then there are the numerous stereotypes: the black and latino ""cleaning ladies"" who become ""empowered""; the bible-thumping white ""big boss man"" who sadistically bullies and tortures and shoots anyone that crosses his path; the ""devious Russians"" carrying out covert operations; and, of course, the ""lonely homosexual"" who has been alienated all his life by 20th Century Western society.Please, Guillermo. A 21st-Century ""social justice"" monster movie? Sheesh.These stereotypes are politically-correct cardboard cut-outs (unlike the characters in most del Toro films), which left me thinking that del Toro didn't work his usual magic on this one.So, no. No Oscar vote here.",The Shape of Water,8868
negative,"  With brand recognition of the utmost importance in today's blockbuster landscape, it is no surprise that we're being served up a reboot to a franchise based on a video game. Or maybe it's a prequel? Or a direct adaptation of the game series? It doesn't really matter, because this movie is completely disposable. Serving as an origin story to some degree, this Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a brash adrenaline junkie ready to self-destruct at any moment. She's not yet the gun-toting badass we know she will become, but Vikander has a raw physicality that suits the role. It's a shame then, that she's hamstrung by an astonishingly bad script. ClichÈs abound in a plot that relies on clunky exposition, signposted twists and flimsy character motivation, and that's even before the laughably woeful final act. The action doesn't fare much better either, with the uninspired choreography, choppy editing and undercooked CGI resulting in a complete lack of thrills. This is the sort of lazy action flick where mercenary henchmen wielding semi-automatic weapons miss targets from only a few metres away, and a ridiculous abundance of chokeholds are used to ""raise"" the stakes. But perhaps the biggest atrocity is Walton Goggins' antagonist Mathias Vogel, a villain so disinterested he's practically comatose. At times I thought Goggins was about to break the fourth wall and apologetically explain to the audience that he needed the paycheque to cover some debts. Vikander is clearly trying her hardest but it's ultimately to no avail, Tomb Raider is a yawn-inducing adventure that'll quickly be forgotten.",Tomb Raider,9897
negative,"  With questionable story decisions that seem to reboot and/or just wipe clean all 7 previous episodes for the sake of subverting expectations but without delivering anything satisfying instead, there was very little for me to enjoy here. With plot threads setup by Force Awakens (2015) cut short and with no explanations to how the universe is in its current state after the of Civil War. The story leads nowhere, starting with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys, and ending with the evil guys almost destroying the good guys. It fails to treat the original cast of the OT respectfuly, and fails to provide the characters setup by Abrams 2 years prior with any meaningful development. Duplicating scenes from ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" almost frame by frame, it feels short out of ideas. A lot of the characters come across a very incompetent, and many are misused or almost ignored entirely. The movie's tone is all over the place, with some scenes struggling to make sure if they wanna make you feel sad and anxious for the heroes, or laughing as if this was a light hearted comedy. More power to those who love the movie. to me, it wasn't an enjoyable film, even with very low expectations.",The Last Jedi,314

negative,"  Wow, what a steaming pile of magical shiny poop! Bear with me.I really, really wanted to like this movie. I'm a sucker for brilliant and intriguing ideas. Plus, with such an amazing cast it would be hard to go wrong, right? Well.Let's start with the good stuff:+ the acting was as good as it's gonna get when you force great actors to be constantly stunned and whisper-mumble in proper indie-movie fashion+some of it is really prettyNow the bad, and it's a lot:- Characters: We don't know anything about them except their professions. Their motivations are either not there or questionable. Like our main character Lena, whose husband is the lone survivor returning from the mysterious shimmer and suddenly and unreasonably starts spitting blood. Now here's what I don't understand - if someone comes back from Hiroshima with cancer or from Malaysia with Malaria nobody would actually suggest going there to find a cure. No, you'd look at the patient's body and look for a cause. Instead of some lame scene of our main characters being all Instagram-perfect in their sun-flooded bedroom, we could have really needed a scene explaining character motivation. How am I going to root for a character if I'm not invested in their cause?- Randomness to simulate meaning:A popular indie-film trick is to show us a lot of random awkward scenes to poke at our raw human-ness, which is great if there actually is a deeper meaning behind it. But this movie tries really hard to be about human identity, which has little to do with the plot and also we never quite get there. Instead, we see scenes of our main character cheating, which contributes nothing to the story and doesn't get resolved, either. And then there's that scene where they lose their memory, for no reason except it lets the producer of the hook because they don't have to shoot how they got there. - No one was employed to research the actual science:My biggest pet hate is when I'm taken for stupid. Okay, so (SPOILER) summary, within the shimmer, DNA gets scattered like ""light on a prism"". Amazingly interesting concept. Unfortunately, rock doesn't have DNA, so there's nothing to scatter for it to turn to dirt. Come on, now. Every sci-fi movie gets away with a little science mumbo-jumbo but that's just downright embarrassing.- Modern danceThe end made no sense, not scientifically, not logically. (SPOILER) I mean come on you're telling me in three years no one has tried to set fire to the thing? Plus, if it was that sensitive it would have burned up when entering the atmosphere. Seriously?There is one thing that the movie does really well, though - it shows how open the audience is to trickery. The movie is set up to look deep and meaningful and gloomy and looking at the ratings it has worked. A lot of mumbling, weirdness, randomness and a Stranger Things type soundtrack emulate real depth, sense and make try to brush over the fact that this movie has no coherent plot whatsoever.",Annihilation,3923
negative,"  Wow,why was the penis talk necessary in movie geared for children. This movie is a insult to the original. What a ripoff job to the public. I think they are riding the coat tail and making millions of dollars on us people who except these junk movies and give away our money. Unfortunately it's to late after we spend it with them it and I believe that's what they know. If you have young children and don't want them to see grown men peeing and talking about how it feels and asking for other men to help them you might not want to watch it with them.Most of the movie is all talking very little action",Jumanji,6180
negative,"  Wow. Hollywood has become so incredibly transparent. So after The Artist, this is the movie that we have to fall in love with now. Because it is set in the early 60's, so nostalgia. Because the characters watch old black and white movies in their retro tv sets, while talking about how wonderful they are, so meta-nostalgia. Because the movie theater, the signs, the cars, the clothes, the pies and the diner...because nostalgia.Honestly, the story seems forced. Some characters and their relationships seem forced and placed/written just to make a point. The sassy black woman who complains throughout the movie about her husband (one could say she's actually complaining about all husbands, on behalf of all women), and finally puts him down at the end as the spineless coward he is. The old man who is unnecessarily shown to be a homosexual just so we can feel bad for him when he makes a totally uncalled for advance on the man who works the diner, who is an obviously straight white dude, who, for a twofer, gets to have a random black couple walk into the diner just so he can be racist on top of homophobic. I'm not going to focus on the other ""good guy"" being an actual communist, because even though the whole Russians subplot felt unnecessary and a bit forced, I understood his character as a scientist with a conscience, which made me understand his actions beyond his political and patriotic allegiances. And I honestly don't believe there is any relevance to him being a communist good guy. It's more about him being a non-U.S. citizen good guy. Did you know russians can be good people too? now you know.Now on to the bad guy. I'm not going to remark on him being a heterosexual white male, because a person in his position, in that time, would invariably fit that description. It's the fact that he is cold, emotionless, detached, cruel, racist, arrogant, classist, sadistic, tortures animals, is probably misogynistic, and is a general ""meanie"". the only thing missing is if they had literally named him ""donald"". the character feels like the product of the worst fears of a group of radical liberals assembled in a safe space, for the purpose of symbolizing in one man everything they consider to be evil in today's world. The funny thing is how they attempt to make the character profound or interesting, by making him get philosophical about pissing/washing your hands, and teaching us, I mean, the protagonists, about biblical characters and the meaning of certain complex-sounding words. And the whole bit about the candy. I don't get it. I don't buy it.I'll admit I was impacted by the loneliness and detachment that the protagonist must have felt to have engaged in such a relationship with a non-human creature, and I actually had no issue with the sexual aspect of the relationship, because, love is love. This is undoubtedly the most extreme version possible of that message, but it was only the underlying theme of the main story, as opposed to feeling like a message disguised as a story/character. and yet, upon reflection, i can't agree with this either. their romance is incredibly forced and rushed, and she basically has sex with him just because he has a humanoid shape. consider the relationships we build with cats, dogs, or other pets. it never crosses our minds, no matter how lonely we get, to have sex with them, because they look like animals. this creature barely communicates with her, but she decides to have sex with it because it resembles a human and stands on two feet. she's basically fucking her dog, if the dog could stand on two feet and had longer legs and arms. Think about this: There are gorillas who can communicate with sign language. you can have entire conversations with them, hundreds of times more complex than the 2 things the creature ""says"" to her. The gorilla has the most humanoid shape of any animal. so, basically, if he could stand on two feet and look her in the eyes, you could replace the lab with a zoo, the creature with a gorilla who knows sign language, and she ends up, inevitably, fucking a gorilla.The scene that perfectly encapsulates why you will be told to love this movie, is the fantasy sequence where the mute girl starts singing beautifully, and then tap dances with the sea creature on a beautiful stage backed by a big band. All in black and white, of course. Because, nostalgia. even people who liked the movie find this scene laughable and forced.The end also comes out of nowhere, when the creature somehow turns her scar tissue into functional gills. This is the only moment, other than the intro, when the movie felt to me like a fairy tale story. The movie itself didn't feel to me like it was trying to emulate Beauty and The Beast or some other tale, rather it was just inspired by it and other similar tales. The story felt like it was doing its own thing (unlike something like Pacific Rim, for example, which is meant to be viewed as an anime), which makes the fairytale intro and ending feel out of place and forced. If you like Guillermo Del Toro, who I'm not too much of a fan of, other than of his visual imagination, check out any of his other stuff. If you liked Sally Hawkins' performance (which is not ""stellar"", or ""phenomenal""), you'll be much better off seeing her in Happy-Go-Lucky or Made In Dagenham. Or watch her in this too (she does a good job) and make up your own mind about the whole thing. Just don't let Hollywood awards shows and critics dictate what you should watch and much less what you should like and love. Remember The Artist. Remember The Last Jedi. Remember The Shape Of Water.",The Shape of Water,8751
negative,"  Wow. Netflix has officially become the Buzzfeed of the film world.The lazy attempt to jump on the ""Empowering women in the film industry"" bandwagon is about as flimsy as the plot.So...the plot.The movie opens on Natalie Portman patronising (they'd call this ""mansplaining"" if she had a penis) a class of university medical students, by explaining what a cell is. It then cuts almost immediately to Nat at home crying over her lost husband, as a soppy emotional song plays. We've never met this guy, therefore we don't care who is or what happened to him, and all we know of Nat at this point is that she's patronising and anti-social. Yet for some reason, [insert director / writer names here] seem to think we give a damn. No. We don't. Also, ever hear of the power of silence? It would have been much stronger, emphasising the emptiness of her life. I don't know anything about making movies, but I know that two minutes into a movie that has told us nothing about the characters, I don't give a damn about the characters. This is all a part of the ""sensitive feelings"" bandwagon that needy film makers have been blindly jumping onto lately.Ok. Zombie husband comes home and they both get taken to the base on the border of soap bubble land, at EXACTLY the same point in time that the govt is about to send an ethnically-diverse, all women-squad with zero training (two of the three can't even work out north from south) into the bubble land wilderness to survive alone, Bear Grylls style.They head off into soap bubble land laden with equipment but without the ONLY thing the govt knows (because of zombie husband who Nat herself said looks like a victim of radiation or chemicals) will be effective - biohazard suits and oxygen masks.It also just so happens that Nat has EXACTLY the right qualifications to slot into the Ghostbusterettes team as clueless and utterly untrained team member 5. So, double coincidence / s**tty lazy storyline.Also we have a quick sex scene in which Nat of course is on top.We also see a flashback to a room in which she's getting bluntly interrogated by a man (because men are evil and without feelings).They shoot a crocodile, thankfully without crossing the beams and...annihilating everything.Then they find a video recorder with a film (that has been spliced and edited within the recorder) which extremely clearly shows a man with a slimy creature sliding around in his stomach for over ten seconds, yet one of the ghostbusterettes (plainly not the Bill Murray one who has some sense of reality) laughably, dismisses it as a trick of the light.Nat has a flashback to good times with her husband, to a song that that blatantly rips off The Last of Us soundtrack.Some other stuff happens. It all looks a lot like The Last of Us. I think they go crazy or something and start seeing trippy 90s-style graphics. Someone runs through a cave like a moron and we see lots of Nat looking concerned. There's a room with a guy who forgot to take off his green-screen suit. I zoned out at some point in the second half so not really sure what happens really. There are some cells and fires and it all gets vague and surreal like so many of these films now.So.I'm all for equality. But not when it's being appropriated without sense or logic and being used for no other reason than [insert director / writer names here] want to jump onto the latest social movement bandwagon like zombie lemmings because they're spineless and desperate for praise.Also, there's a trend for movies to be vague and open-ended, especially art-house films. The makers seem to think this is arty. No. It's f**ing lazy and shows you don't give a damn about your audience.This movie will probably do really well because social media is conning people into thinking garbage is good for them. But thankfully, history will be much less kind to nonsense like this.",Annihilation,4251

negative,"  Wrinkle In Time is a waste of time to see -- the acting is stiff except for a couple parts, and the mood is soppy, over the top. A few moments work, but save your time! Actually largely the effect is to insult the audience. I almost didn't criticize the unctuous PC virtue signaling to ""diversity"" --- seeing that this has become a highly public controversy. But it's just true, the movie has such pedantic and obvious (add-on, unnecessary and therefore offensively forced) references to Lefty Social Justice Warrior themes and personalities.

negative,"  Yesterday I saw Jumanji with a friend.We left after one hour. I could not bear it any longer.That movie is the worst I have seen in a very long time. Normally that's not a reason to post something on instagram, but I want to tell you what is so awful about that movie.It is full of prejudices and stereotypes. A few examples after the ""plot"": There are four teenagers who get sucked into the game Jumanji. By getting sucked into the game they also receive the bodies an abilities of the game characters.One of those teenagers is black. At first, he is a rather cool guy, but bad in school. First shit: why has the black guy to perform bad in school? Second shit: When he is finally transformed into the character he changes from the cool guy into the dumb guy, the one people laugh about. He becomes the joke of the group. And he acts like so many other black joke characters in US-American movies: He is short tempered and clumsy. Why always the black guy? I mean really: Why does it always have to be the black guy who is the clumsy sidekick of the main hero (who is most of the time white)?Third shit: One girl happens to be the smart one who does not want to participate in gym class and is rather shy. When she is transformed she becomes a sexy killer machine who later has to flirt with some guys in the game to distract them. Another girl (now transformed into a chubby man) teaches the sexy killer machine how to flirt with guys in general, because the smart one has never done it and does not know how. Why does the smart girl needs to be taught by the ""cool and pretty"" girl (now the chubby guy) how to flirt with guys? I don't get it. She is good looking and very intelligent, she will get a man (if she wants to) not by knowing how to flirt with dumb-ass guys who only want to f*** you/her but by being amazing. Why is it presented in this movie as if the ability to flirt with guys is necessary for girls/women?The story itself is crap, too. I cannot recommend the movie at all and I am so looking forward for the humanistic and feminist revolution which is so long overdue for all of us: women, men, people of colour (why is the colour even still an issue?), people with different sexualities and so on and so on.I'm so sick of all that chauvinistic, racist, homophobic etc. bullshit and nonsense!!!!!",Jumanji,6734

negative,"  You know what you haven't heard enough about recently? That's right, identity politics, and I'll bet for movies in particular representation has hardly even come up. Well just leave it to me, a white, cis-hetero male to man-splain or, if you will, com-man-plain (?) about our cinematic paradigm and the shift that should be happening but isn't (even though it seems like it is). In the past year or two there have been a spate of films that have broken the mold for representation in Hollywood, and for all the avid audience members that cheer triumphantly at a particular casting decision or character trait, there is a white, cis-hetero man with tears welling up in his eyes for joy at the steady increase of his bank account. Ultimately, it's people like Kevin Feige who are on cloud nine when a movie like Black Panther dominates the box office, and people like Jim Whitaker who taste the pain when a movie like A Wrinkle in Time will most certainly fail.Admittedly, it is a cynical viewpoint to consider only the financial results of a film and who benefits from it the most. After all, Ryan Coogler will have a massive budget on whatever his next film is if he doesn't get resigned to the Mediocre-Superhero-Cinema-Industrial-Complex. He will probably cast as many people of color as he can fit into the movie because he can and probably should. As proven by the Oscars this year, Hollywood is a diverse, splendorous world where all are freely invited to spend their money. They have always had a one-size fits all attitude about what a film can be about and who it's for. Up until a few years ago, the size that fit all consisted of diverse casting, but not too diverse because they didn't want to alienate the WmiddleHaged,ImiddleTclassE demographic who frequented theaters the most.See, it's not just finances, it's marketing too. Since we've had a p(l)easant three decades of Reagan America's ""War on the Poor"", the dwindling middle class and the even more dwindling movie-going public have become the diverse melting-pot of ethnicities, races, genders, and sexual identities that we were told America is supposed to be all about. So it's no wonder that gender and race inclusive casting seems awesome in the cultural vacuum of the few people who actually still want to go to a theater and the film makers who need to make money off of them. However, it reeks of hollow lip service to pretentious assholes like moi. ""Think of the children"" one may retort, ""finally, they have heroes to look up to that look like them."" There's the problem: I don't like children - regardless of race, gender, and nationality. There are too many of them, the world owes them nothing, and they are annoying especially in a movie theater and most of the time on film.This is at the heart of my argument, there's a massive problem with the glorification of nostalgia and childhood. It allows film makers to be even more lazy with themes, dialogue, plot logic, and character development than usual. Nothing more is expected past a certain intellectual threshold, and it is childish in every sense of the word. Wonder Woman is strong and cunning, and that's it. Black Panther is strong and cunning, and that's it. It's not a new thing. There have always been these stoic and simplistic archetypal leads filling an anthropomorphic hole in their respective films, but that was before CG sucked the soul out of everything surrounding the Person with No Name. A constant upping the ante of fantastical environments has led to a clinical and critical shortcoming of major productions. These worlds and characters are transient thrills to fill a progressive atrophy in imagination. They are hot-button trigger words to trick you into aligning with a blank canvas of a character for reasons almost completely external to the films they inhabit as opposed to experiencing a fantastical world through the open eyes of a timeless character. They've overspent their value as pre-nostalgic set-pieces for the sake of a quick buck and at the cost of your attention. It's another superficial ""by the numbers"" decision to maximize revenue.It wouldn't be so bad if these characters had some insightful sense of depth. I'm not talking about an elaborate set of titles and fart-box MacGuffin swords they acquired on the magical Neptunian archipelago of Antarctica. I'm talking about real human emotion. I'm talking about strange and terrifying ethical conundrums that changed them as people, deep-seated regrets that haunt them at night, splendorous moments where they felt connected to something beyond love and thought - not fate and destiny and that one guy who died or that one guy who killed everybody that always seem to be the stand-ins for character motivation. Everything is spelled out unambiguously and simplistically because if an audience is left to ruminate about something too long, they will probably get out of their seats and trash the theater in a mass hissy fit like the children they are assumed to be. I feel bad for the races, genders, ethnicities, and orientations being represented in these movies because the audience they are meant to embody are being talked down to and sold short.Lara Croft, the titular Tomb Raider, is a woman who is overly capable of a decathlon, but most importantly, she is a pre-existing IP that is easily capitalized upon amidst our socio-political disdain for patriarchy despite the fact that every motivation she has is in service to or as a reaction to her daddy (who loves her, as we are reminded through constant flashbacks). The plot is a mixture of the vastly superior Raiders of the Lost Ark and the similarly crappy The Mummy (2017). This pisses me off because Alicia Vikander is a great actress who should be in more movies, but here she is given a boring, sexless, ersatz-empowerment role in a film where her character might as well have been played by a blue chimpanzee, or worse, Tom Cruise. I'm sorry if what I'm about to say will irreparably crush your nine year old daughter's dreams of becoming the President of Earth, but this movie sucks.",Tomb Raider,9555

The dialogue in this film is sometimes so hammy and atrocious it takes away from the film. some CG isn't the greatest, but for the most part a majority of it looks great. The action is pretty intense, but it still had a slightly anti-climatic ending. Overall, I would say it's worth a rent if you're a fan of the series.

positive,"  ""Annihilation"" is a beautiful study of self-destruction and a fantastic, intellectual piece from Alex Garland. Based on Jeff VanderMeer's best-selling Southern Reach Trilogy, Annihilation stars Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Tuva Novotny and Oscar Isaac. It was written and directed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, 28 Days Later).When artists come together to work with big studios, there's often conflict. Big studios like Paramount Pictures aren't around to make amazing films, rather, their main focus is money. That doesn't mean great films can't be made, but they're more interested in appealing to the mass market. When you get an artist like Alex Garland who has a strong vision and a clear voice, it's hard to argue with that result. I'm glad we got to see the film Alex Garland made and not one that was changed to appeal to the mass audiences, because this film was amazing in so many ways. One thing I loved about this film was the general message itself. I won't go deep into it but it's a film about self-destruction and what we do to ourselves as people. We all approach it in different ways and ultimately, we all do it with a new goal in mind. He approaches this theme in a subtle way, one that's much more artistic and visually appealing than most other stories. Because of this, a lot of the general audience won't like this film at all, but those who dig deeper will see everything he's trying to tell us. Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance. Without a doubt, her performance felt so real and unnerving. It was subtle yet emotional, never feeling like she was overplaying her role. She was great as the lead and owned her character. Her, along with the rest of the female cast (and Oscar Isaac) were all wonderful. What I also like about the performances was that this was a movie with primarily women. Yeah, it's cool to see women have ""empowering"" roles, but Alex Garland did it in a more subtle and not so in your face way. As an Asian-American dude, I love seeing diversity win on screen. Garland was able to defy norms in a non-cheesy and respectable way. This film is not only one of the best visual masterpieces I've seen in a while, but the best of the year. The story is told through the visuals. The visuals aren't pretty just to be pretty. There aren't beautiful shots just to have them. They're all there for a purpose. Some of the imagery is so beautiful yet so simultaneously haunting. I literally gasped in awe at some of the things I saw on screen. The images are genuinely just astonishing and there's so much symbolism in the smallest of things. The film is well composed, well lit, and perfect in that sense.In the end, I'd love to talk about specifically what I loved about this film, but that'd be spoiling things. All I can say is watch this film, because it'll certainly be one of the best of the year.",Annihilation,4831

Again if youre stucked in the past, meaning (an unwillingness to grasp and integrate old important values from a childhood long gone and bringing them forward and developing them to the current adult mind in a post-rational era), this movie will seem totally irrelevant. As Luke Skywalker goes from the heroic young and innocent into the dark night of the soul only to discover boundaryless enlightenment, so should we the audience.

positive,"  ""The Shape of Water"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. The performances in this film are brilliant, with a unique female lead who cannot speak and must communicate with sign language.One of the things that works really well in this film is the way that it takes certain genres or certain norms in film and it will flip them upside down. For instance, Elisa (Sally Hawkins) falls in love with the ""asset"" or the Amphibian man (Doug Jones), the film takes a departure from the classic monster-romance film and Elisa is the one who makes a transformation into a ""monster"" or mermaid as the case may be. This up-ends our classical representation of a monster-romance such as ""Beauty And The Beast"" in which a beast is civilized by a woman. Another thing that is done so well that other films attempt but fail to succeed in is that it calls back to different styles of performing arts. The Gene Kelly-like dream sequence that covers a large portion in the ""second act"" if you can call it that, reminds us of the time of musical theater adaptations. This is done masterfully, while not startling an audience with a palate for action and thrills. The dream-sequence is completely in sync with the tone of the rest of the film. There are certainly many more great things about this film that I could go on writing for hours - but these were the highlights whichever stood out the most to me.

positive,"  ""Wise men build bridges, foolish men build barriers."" -T'Challa, The King of WakandaAfter almost a month since it's release I finally saw Black Panther. Took me way too long to see it. I'm just gonna start out saying it really isn't like most of Marvel's other movies. It has some of the most interesting production design I have seen in a Marvel production since Guardians of the Galaxy, and the score really sets the tone and separates it from the rest. The hand-to-hand combat is something Marvel has lacked in recent years mainly due to the fact that many of their heroes, and villains have powers, and instead rely more on CGI. I don't have a problem with this, but I haven't seen fight scenes in the MCU this well choreographed since Daredevil season 1, and Winter Soldier.Without revealing too much, the villain was dope, and might be one of my 3 favorite villains in the MCU. You actually feel sorry for him, and even the film itself feels this way too. It also wasn't too reliant on referencing other films. With a lot of Marvel films, they love referencing things that have either already happened, or will happen. With the exception of probably 3 moments in the film, Black Panther stands on its own feet. Even if you haven't seen Civil War, or any Marvel movies, I recommend giving this a watch.Overall, this is a film that deserves all the praise it's getting. It really isn't ""just another Marvel movie."" It is something special, and in terms of style, and story it has a lot to offer to the modern blockbuster.

positive,"  ""You failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me.""When I was a boy, watching Return of the Jedi on VHS, I began to realize I was watching something more than just a grand spectacle with action and adventure. By the end of that film Luke Skywalker saves the day, not by blowing something up or wielding a light sabre. Instead, he throws his sword away and sacrifices himself. He does something that most cinematic heroes do not do. He forgoes violence and puts his faith in the humanity found in the destructive and corrupt monster he was meant to slay. Learning that the entertaining action film I was watching was also a story of forgiveness and redemption, left a mark on me at a young age. I believe it is why my love of the Star Wars films endured into my adulthood.In the Last Jedi, Rian Johnson also succeeds in his attempt to create a movie that was more than just an adolescent spectacle. He does give us a film with desperate space battles, wondrous creatures and emotional duels with laser swords. However, he also takes the time to create an unexpected journey for each of the main characters. In this film the reckless hotshot doesn't get to be the hero with a foolhardy act of youthful bravado that ignores the costs of war. The hard-driven general, who has always been the strongest soldier no matter what the cruel galaxy takes from her, finally feels the burden of all she has lost. The survivalist learns why he must sacrifice. And in this saga, the villain and the hero are left with no clear quest or mentors to guide them. The film ends with Luke Skywalker saving the day in a unique and unexpected twist that upon reflection is very familiar. Like in Return of the Jedi, he does not use his laser sword or grab or push something with the force. But instead, through an act of sacrifice and faith, he inspires a new galaxy of heroes and redeems himself.The Last Jedi did not go the way I thought. It was a more complicated, daring and complete film and it will hopefully leave a mark on young fans for a lifetime.",The Last Jedi,527

When we see what place and time it is to know all discomforts we may face being who we are in a man's world that puts us out of place. When we see what places those hold for us when the time is strict that puts us out of the workplace to know what discomforts we live by. When we see its always comforting to have those in the same place as we are amongst those in high places to know how time flys with those by our side. When we see what place others rather be when it's home to see all comforting places & time we are put in our place. When we see what place we make time for when it is comforting, to make such places routine when we have to be in other places less comforting to make time for the place that takes us to other comforting places. When we see what place could use our time and company when it's places of comfort that others don't have time to go see when busy places don't have time for timeless places like movie theatres. When we see what places others enjoy when it's being served, having everything prepared and handed to them when the time of full functionality in the workplace keeps everyone in place and time to know what comforts those on top keep an eye on and discomforts of those who are being watched need to abide to. When we see what places that come from higher places to see what such places has to offer, we see a time of discomfort when the world is in competition from business to politics to know what such discomfort brings to deliver the next technological revolution. When we see it is always great to share what we see is comforting with others who share what is comforting to know what place we share in common that the world doesn't see, when the time of change pushes power ahead of powerless that we see transitioning from one time to another we lose such places. When we see what place those will lose to only break them out, when old places and new places are no longer wanted that they find themselves in a time where higher places wish to move forward to a more comforting place in weaponry to protect what discomforts us, threats from our enemies. When we see that there is no place and time moving forward with those who we share such comforting place with we see what we must protect to get out. When we see what place we go to protect those from threats we see that time only puts those in discomfort when it isn't real and we see a comforting time turn discomforting when we see ourselves as threatening to the world when our actions in the pursuit of power dehumanizes us. When we see living in such comforting places of promise, we see it's compromised when it comes at the cost of other places when time reveals all scars and lack of authenticity in the places we live in, that it becomes discomforting to know it's not real. When we see the only place that we can share such places with those that share in the comforts of natural places we see what time will takes us, when it's hidden, below those who are shallow, and in discomforting places that we need to get used to.When we don't always see how great advancements come to be that we see that we put many in discomfort for the pursue of science when time & competition was a stake to know what comforts we enjoy today came from those we thank. When we see time has always made discomforting patterns in all places before comfort is restored to know we have to accept discomfort when building a comfortable world.

positive,"  (minor spoilers!) I was skeptical since the movie seemed so overhyped, but it proved me wrong and was very enjoyable and pleasant. The characters seemed real and like real people for the most part, which is important. The plot was very good and had depth to it. And I loved how Simon continued to love Blue no matter who he thought he was, showing that he loved his personality and that who he was didn't matter. Overall it was very good, I loved the emotion in all the characters and thought the movie was really really sweet. It was a very good movie and plan on seeing it again!",Love Simon,7500

positive,"  **ANALYSIS/SPOILERS**During my first watch, I spent a long while asking Where is this going? Where am I being taken? even as I was transfixed. Each flashback, found video, artifact, and character choice shaded in new details, but the overall shape remained hazy.Until Lena walks into the lighthouse, and my heart lit up in recognition.Between the body and the video, it's evident what's happened in the lighthouse and that the Kane that appeared at Lena's house was not the Kane who came in. For me, that was the key to my entire understanding of the movie.""You ever get out of here, you find Lena,"" Kane tells himself. As soon as I saw that, my thought was, he escaped because a piece of him loved her enough. That empty person who shows up outside the bedroom--all he has left is his love for her. His compass can't point to north, it can only point to her The cascade of understanding that followed was one of the most intense experiences I've ever had, not just while watching a movie but just as a person. The continuing imagery of the film supported and expanded my interpretation. Lena sees exactly how most of Kane died. Then she delves even deeper and is forced to confront the existential horror of Ventress's an-nihil-lation and the organism at the center of the Shimmer, which uses a drop of her blood to imitate first her morphology, then her movement, and finally her face. When Lena hands her copy a grenade and runs, it doesn't move to follow, mirror, or stop her. Lena makes a choice to destroy it and save herself, and that solidified what I'd begun to read into movie, the lens through which I was now reexamining everything that had come before. My perception of meaning spread forward and backward in time from that one moment, unfolding into new spaces with every new look. Annihilation is about therapy itself. The actual, internal process of first learning to see and then to deliberately, constantly destroy maladaptive parts of yourself, accept influences and impulses you cannot change, and make yourself the person you want to be. For all its fixation on inevitability, genetic programming, the impulse towards self-destruction, the faults in God's blueprint for life, Annihilation is about the distinctly human possibility of rising above all of that destruction to intentionally create something.To save her relationship, Lena undertakes an identity-altering journey to confront herself and what she's done, helmed by a psychologist and dragging all of her guilt, grief, self-destruction, determination, and love along with her. Why does the team wake up with no memory of their first days in the Shimmer? Because anyone's first attempts to tease any meaning from the web of subtle and conflicting information we find when we examine ourselves and the infinity of influences on that Self is futile. Upon beginning the process of therapy, you're mostly just noticing how unmindful you've been, floating forward in time, steered by impulse. You have to learn how to learn, how to determine what is a reliable and useful observation, and when it feels like nothing is, how to move forward anyway.The team examines the evidence--how much they've eaten, which direction is south. Similarly, in therapy, you latch on to something promising, or just the most solid thing you can find, and you explore that. From here on out, everything looks new, impossible, inscrutable. As you learn to acknowledge the internal, environmental, and interpersonal ways you build your Self and how they compound and refract each other, you're forced to acknowledge that you simply are all of your decisions and reactions. Those pieces come from somewhere and go somewhere, and you can study the ways you find yourself feeling controlled or in control, the ways you're affected by everything around you and affect everything in return. You can learn that while the entire process is indeed inscrutable, your patterns within it are not. Those connections are at times both beautiful and terrifying because understanding yourself--enlightenment, if you will--requires complete acceptance of yourself as a collection of experiences and actions, and some of those are very, very bad.The composition of the team of scientists works on so many levels. As far as we know, they're the first scientists to enter the Shimmer; the previous teams were soldiers. This illustrates the ways that trying to force yourself to change without serious self-examination is futile; there is no brute-force solution to fixing something broken within yourself. Everyone becomes a scientist once they begin to examine themselves, to gather evidence and conduct experiments and analyze relationships between variables. Perhaps the best equipped is both scientist and soldier, someone who can face and win the necessary fights along the path to healing; as Ventress tells Lena: ""A soldier scientist. You can fight. You can learn. You can save him.""There's also the explicit textual version of the team: a group of women with little to lose, lots of baggage, and bad coping skills. I've read a lot of opinions that the dialogue on the boat felt unrealistic; I'll agree that this scene gives so much away with so little subtlety that it's not just poor dialogue, it feels out of place in an otherwise uncompromising film. It felt like a studio note: ""put something in there that explains the whole theme of self-destruction!"" However, since we're given it so explicitly, might as well note how neatly these women seem to each have one particular challenge they're facing: Ventress's mortality and lack of connection, Sheppard's grief, Thorensen's addiction and the suggested anger issues fueling it, and Radek's numbness and inability to be vulnerable/honest. Lena is consumed by guilt; it's revealed clearly enough that she knows Kane was aware of her affair and that it was that betrayal that pushed him to volunteer for a mission into the Shimmer in the first place.A little more abstracted: The team is literally led by a psychologist whose singular goal is to reach the source of the problem (notably, Lena's problem, since it holds the answer to saving Kane). Those who accompany Lena help and hold back that quest at varying times; however, at their cores, Radek, Thorensen, Sheppard, and Ventress aren't there to examine themselves. They're too caught up in their self-destructive cycles to get past what's holding them back. Whether it's recklessness, anger, or fear, psychopathy is in control. This applies to Dr. Ventress as well. While in-character Ventress is swept along at the whim of her impulses, her explicit distinction between decisions and impulses at the watchtower illustrates the central conflict of the movie. Yes, she reaches the lighthouse, but she's drawn there impulsively, desperately. Rather than decide how to react, as Kane and Lena do, she is destroyed by her own nihilism. Expectations and your belief that you have some control play a huge role in the success or failure of therapy; if you don't go in believing you will gain something and willing to learn, you're not going to do either. If you are too afraid of change and the ways it is inherently the death of something, you cannot change for the better.So we watch the team break down and the individuals within it break down, in a variety of figurative and literal ways. For me there were simultaneous journeys at each of the previously described levels of abstraction. We have five individuals faced with utter confusion and terror, and we see the ways each person can or can't face, deal with, and move on from the challenges. This reflects the ways real people you interact with while undergoing a therapeutic process can help or hinder your efforts, particularly people who are also suffering from mental illness. The hyper-reactive environment illustrates the various coping methods and the ways the characters and environment begin to absorb and regurgitate each other. Even more abstracted: Each of the struggles faced by the team is also affecting Lena, specifically in relation to her affair. Guilt is dominant, and there's the glimmer of hope she has now that some part of Kane has returned. But this is therapy, so we have to work backwards. The affair doesn't take place in a vacuum. We see a little of Lena and Kane's relationship in happy flashbacks, but we learn a lot more about it from Dan. Kane's inability to share his inner life with Lena or connect with her intellectually is mirrored in Radek's numbness; Lena turning to someone else for that connection is just another version of self-harm to satisfy a desperate craving for feeling. We know the affair wasn't a one-time thing, it was an addiction for Lena, stimulation she used to fill the emptiness Kane was unable or unwilling to alleviate despite its corrosion of not only the marriage but ultimately all of Lena's relationships, including her concept of herself. And of course, at the beginning of the movie, Lena is grieving the death of her husband in the wake of the death of trust in her marriage. She can't even grieve as a wife without inflaming her guilt for pushing Kane away, seemingly to his death, without ever being able to admit, apologize, atone, or explain. Like Ventress, she's just stuck expecting but never quite achieving the certainty of those deaths, unable to share her pain; similarly, she jumps at the chance to use the fact that she has nothing left to lose to at least try to find answers that might allow something she cares about to outlive her. The affair is so central to Lena's motivations on so many levels that I have trouble understanding some of the reactions I've read that say the character motivations felt muddled or that they can't understand why anyone would go into the Shimmer. We have one obvious perspective character, and she has one obvious goal: saving her husband's life because she both loves him and feels responsible for his near-death and the pain that preceded it. At the beginning of the movie when she asks if she's allowed to go home, Ventress says ""Is that what you want?"" and Lena says ""I want to be with him."" There are a million beautiful details, but that is the only point. And the only way to do that is to enter the Shimmer and learn everything she can about what happened to him. He asked her to save him, to save them, and she rose to the challenge. It just turns out that inside the Shimmer, she's forced to face what she did to him, not just from her perspective, but from his. She learns how certain his death was when he chose to go in, the disintegration of self that he watched his teammates succumb to. The house in the abandoned settlement in the Shimmer is a copy of Kane and Lena's house. It's no accident that Lena is faced with the bear-monster inside that house, the nightmarish union of a loved one stolen by and then entangled with an unpredictable predator. For Kane, during the affair, he was trapped in that house, tied to a marriage, hearing screams and moans he never wanted to imagine, trying not to give away that he even knows the problem's there. Just as Thorensen blames Lena for Sheppard's death through her inaction and her dishonesty for destabilizing the group's efforts going foward, Kane feels responsible for pushing Lena away, to someone else, irreversibly damaging their relationship and taking with it the trust on which any future might be built. Thorensen explodes when she finds her trust betrayed but instead of attacking only Lena directly, she ties everyone up and traps them in the house--as Lena's choice did to both her and Kane. Thorensen screams the words Kane wanted to say to Lena, who is forced to look those accusations in the face. Then, literal ghost of their earlier actions haunts them in that house, stalking the walls they've put up to hide their feelings from each other (targeting Radek) that feeds it before finally being neutralized by Lena ending the affair (Thorensen's death) and Kane's decision to volunteer for the mission (mirroring Radek's self-harm, need to do/feel something coping mechanism--she kills the bear) that solves nothing except the most immediate, superficial problem (the bear/affair). Ventress, with her inability to form romantic or familial or even friendly connections, leaves immediately, just as any possibility of Lena and Kane communicating did.I think it's crucial that it's after this moment, and after Ventress has left the group, that Josie chooses to radically change herself. Not only has Josie, as a character, been examining herself as she trekked through the shimmer and seen the possibilities it presents, but Lena can finally empathize with Kane's pain (after the bear scene) and thus connect with him. It's time for Josie, as a character, as a symbol, as an aspect of Lena, to find resolution. Josie uses her sudden self-knowledge to find the new way ""to feel alive"" that Sheppard said she was searching for, becoming a haunting, beautiful monument to the peace that is possible through acceptance and vulnerability. This is the same decision Kane makes. ""Imagine dying frightened and in pain and having that as the only part of you that survives."" Kane chooses, like Josie, to make sure that part of him is not the part that lives.By entering the Shimmer, Kane underwent his own therapeutic process, and lost so much of himself along the way. However, he also learned what he needed to do and found the strength to do it. We see Kane's character arc out of order, so it's a little hard to piece together, but it starts with the man who left on a suicide mission rather than call out his wife for cheating and actually talk about his problems. The depiction of Kane in the video found at the the abandoned base is brutally practical. He is able to make decisions and act under the direst of circumstances in the service of his goals, which are actually pretty selfless. This shows that Kane is rising to the challenge of the shimmer. If he had been able to slice open his marriage to show the corruption underneath the skin rather than ditching Lena without ever addressing the affair, well, there wouldn't be a movie. It was this strength and singularity of purpose that allowed part of him to escape the Shimmer and demand commensurate action from Lena. He finds the resilience to reflect deeply, the humility to accept his part in things, and finally the ability to choke out the words ""I don't think I'm well"" to the one person he needs to tell. For me, the idea of whether he is ""the same person"" is irrelevant and unknowable. Indeed, we don't know which Kane is the ""alien"" and which is the Kane that walked into the Shimmer, or whether that question is even relevant based on how much of the original Kane was in each body. When we find new strength or new darkness in ourselves, are we the same person? How much change would it take to make us a new person? Isn't that the essence of being a person, to be in a state of constant change and not notice until it happens abruptly and painfully? All these questions, then, arise in the moments between Lena finding Kane's body/the camera in the lighthouse and meeting the alien. I immediately interpreted this as the death of Kane's cowardice and weakness and lack of clarity, and the survival of the Kane who, above all else, wanted to find his wife. I think Lena did, too: she watched all of his depersonalization, his questioning, his avoidance, just disintegrate into certainty. She knows as well as us where the Kane who lives goes: home, to her. In the darkness under the lighthouse, Lena catches up with an eyeless, presumably sightless, Ventress. As an individual, she's unable to process her fear of death. She's so consumed by the knowledge of death encroaching throughout her body that she can't see anything beyond that ending. She can only interpret what she finds there in terms of her end. Is that why the alien doesn't approach her to create a copy? In the framing of this meeting, we see light and dark paths behind Lena; only darkness and dead ends surround Ventress. She hasn't reached any deeper understanding of herself or created the new, stronger person she needs to become to find acceptance in the face of her imminent death. Instead, she dies terrified, projecting her own feelings onto the forces of change. As a symbol, we see her literally annihilated, by the definition I included at the beginning of this piece: She becomes light. She never sees that light, but Lena does. The enlightened Lena faces the alien presence that morphs to look and act more and more like her. We've caught up to the moment I described earlier, and the crux of the movie. We see alien watch Lena, mirror her, hold her, to her disgust and horror. What is it learning from her? At first has no gendered features, but a prominent belly button (its human essence, the idea that it was born, is exaggerated through this and the birth imagery of the cave), while not having enough information yet for social construction or exchange. This made me wonder how much time Kane spent with his double, a much more developed copy. It has learned the details of his appearance, his language, even a bit of his heart. We know Lena spent four months in the Shimmer and Kane spent maybe twelve; presumably, a lot of that was here, at the lighthouse, getting to the point where his dying words to his alien self feel like a benediction to a friend.The one thing the alien mimics instead of mirroring is Lena's attempt to run away. The alien runs the same direction and ends up holding her back from that goal, nearly suffocating her against the wall of the lighthouse. It's a literalization of the futility of running away from your problems, from your darkest impulses, and most crucially for Lena the consequences of her actions, instead of facing them. It also shows that what the new Lena is learning is the worst of her, the things she needs to overcome. When describing the alien to Lomax she says she doesn't think it wants anything; I think it's more accurate to say that its wants, its impulses are learned, just as all of ours are. They are only a mystery because we didn't pay attention to being taught. Lena has now learned how to do that, thanks to the Shimmer, and she knows what to do if given a second chance. Lena chooses to destroy the new thing and leave, and the Shimmer's distortion and exaggeration is destroyed with it. We don't know, and even she doesn't know, if she made the correct choice or if Kane did, in starting over. She has shut the door on what that person could have become. The Kane that kills himself is a shell full of the things the wanted to leave behind, because you can't leave the Shimmer without owning your choices and acting with purpose. You get out by adapting to the chaos and learning to constantly locate your evolving self within it. It's meaningful that, instead of sitting with Kane's body, Lena's alien crawls back into its lonely hole to die, disconnected and alone, surrendered to destruction like Ventress. Lena saved the part of herself that loves Kane.Obviously, the person being questioned is different from the Lena who went into the Shimmer. We'll never know all the ways that's true; even Lena probably won't. None of us can fully comprehend or control the ways we change over time, we can only control our choices and accept responsibility for the person we are even as we attempt to study all the uncontrollable factors that influence us. Understanding is not a moment; it's an unending process. It's work with surprising, unpredictable moments of reward. What we do know is that the Lena who got out wants nothing more than to embrace the husband she's saved, and that husband, whatever new person he has made, hugs her back. Their reconciliation is the moment both of them get what they singularly wanted and worked for and died for and rebuilt themselves for. And you don't get to that moment of peace, that new beginning full of renewed trust, without every bit of that work. Our sentience is the key to turning off the thoughtless, impulsive destruction we're pulled towards over time: it allows us to see ourself in where we have been, what we've done, and what can be created. Therapy, or any self-reflection, is itself a continuous mutation.Annihilation is a love story about two shattered, disintegrating people who actually love each other enough to go through the pain and work of changing, of building a more complete, more resilient, and more loving self. As someone who has been the Kane at the top of the stairs, asking someone else to acknowledge their part in my destruction only to have them do nothing, as someone who's been into the Shimmer to save myself, to make something new, many times, that's transcendently beautiful to me.",Annihilation,4508
positive,"  *First things first. Annihilation is one of those types of movies that if you don't pay attention and just focus on getting action sequences, you will not understand the movie by the ending. Every word that is said in this movie from start to end is important and will hook you in from the beginning even before they enter the ""Shimmer"".*Alright now to the review. Like I said, once the movie started, I knew that this movie would focus more on story than just pure action, so I knew to pay attention to the dialogue. Once I did, this movie went from what seemed like an unoriginal plot at first to the most original movies I had ever seen at the theater in a way that will shock you in many ways those scenes deliver. It wasn't emotional to me, but beautiful,creepy, and intense all at the same time. Annihilation is worth the buck if you love these Suspenseful Thriller types of movies.",Annihilation,4657
positive,"  . I have just returned from watching the action-packed reboot of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise with Swedish actress Alicia Vikander in the title role and she is so extraordinary I was literally in awe of her for its almost two-hour runtime. Pre-publicity suggested that Lara Croft had been re-imagined, doing away with the sexy portrayal that the aforementioned Jolie had turned in, but I would claim that Vikander's brand of powerful athleticism is incredibly sexy. Sure, she's not shown in the tight-fitting outfits that Jolie pranced around her two movies in, but Vikander doesn't need them to be stunning, she has a poise and a grace that Jolie could never muster and when she turns on the heat the screen sizzles.The plot for what it is worth, concerns Vikander's Lara Croft seeking answers to the disappearance of her father several years earlier. He had ventured to an uncharted uninhabited island off Japan in the center of a particularly vicious sea in search of the tomb of a legendary Queen of Death. It seems a criminal organization known as Trinity is also hunting for the tomb and very soon Lara is off running through the desert, escaping certain death in several fist-clenching moments. I held my breath several times, feeling the director ratchet up the tension as I tried to figure out how Lara would survive the predicament. I had heard from earlier reviews that the movie had slow spots in it and I have to wonder if that reviewer saw the same movie as I. For shortly after a 'chase the fox' bicycle race in the streets of London and Lara is in Hong Kong racing after a trio of thieves before taking to the high seas in a raging storm. Full credit goes to Vikander who not only takes the action in her stride but is also able to pull off a very believable British accent. She balances the earnestness of her character's search with measured humor and humanity to bring dimension to a character that (since the origin is a popular video game) could have been wafer-thin. My favorite scene could quite possibly be a sequence that finds Lara hanging onto an old plane wing above a raging waterfall. Vikander is ably supported in her role by British actors Dominic West and Kristin Scott Thomas as Lara's missing father and her guardian respectively. Scott Thomas appears very briefly at the beginning and the end, though it is suggested she could have a larger role in any subsequent sequel. The villain of the piece is a suitably diabolical character named Mathias Vogel, a Trinity man-on-the-ground played with relish by Walton Goggins. Much of the humor is provided by sea captain Lu Ren played by Daniel Wu and his ""drunken sailor"" quip got a chuckle from the audience I saw the movie with.It's a foregone conclusion that I will want to see this movie again and again and I am hoping it gets a sequel because I can't wait to see Vikanders brand of action heroine in more fare. This movie comes highly recommended.",Tomb Raider,10110

positive,"  99.8%.Its not for everyone. But for me, this was the greatest movie experience of my entire life. All the games I grew up playing on the big screen in one more, presented in an incredible way. I cannot express in words what this was like. I often use this one analogy when I describe what going to Comic-Con is like for people who have never been to one -- ""It's like a child going to the zoo and seeing animals for the first time"" - well that is sort of what this movie was like for me. I remember when one character says the words, ""I choose the form of ... Gundam"" I literally jumped out of my seat and started clapping. This was ... this was everything. I would legitimately even see this again (except I'm going to opt for maybe buying it on DVD when it becomes available because there were about 100 easter eggs in it that i'd love to find). Other than being incredibly rich with amazing video game and pop culture references, Ready Player One is an incredible movie on its own. While it won't be nearly as enjoyable to non-gamers, It has a fantasic storyline and lots of action that any fan of action/adventure films will enjoy. Without delving too deep into it, in 2025 a man creates the first working Fully Virtual Reality (VR) world just in the nick of time as the world's resources were being depleted and life was looking glum. In 2047, the creator of this incredible virtual world where you can be anyone and do anything (much like the tv series Caprica) passes away and informs players that he has hidden an easter egg in the game and whoever finds it will be able to change the world in their own image as well as inherit his half a trillion dollars worth of stock. A company called IOI or Innovative Online Industries restructures their entire company to trying to find the keys to unlock the easter egg in the virtual world and remake it in their image - one rules by advertisements. The movie focuses on an average young man, and avid gamer, who knows everything there is to know about the VR world's creator and ends up finding the first key - inciting IOI to come after him in real life. Well I would not necessarily recommend this movie to anyone over 45, for all others ... this is as good as it gets people. This is entertainment.",Ready Player One,1415

I just demand an explanation as to how a cat and a dog can see both the living and the dead in the movie.",Coco,5156
positive,"  A beautifully set and acted movie about a changed man. The story in Paul, Apostle of Christ is compelling and moving. How can man who once persecuted and killed Christians become one of the most important leaders in the history of the Christian church? In this film it's evident how Paul's encounter with Christ changed his life. It's a very relevant message for today because we live in a world that says, you are what you do. A world with no mercy, no forgiveness. Paul goes through a very human struggle, wrestling with his past, but the film shows how faith can allow you to change and that in order to love, Someone needs to first love you and embrace all of you. Even your past.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7852

All actors play their parts wonderfully and even though I was less familiar with Tambor as I was the other actors; he plays his ""lack of decision making character"" expertly.

Rian Johnson brilliantly creates the magic with some risks that paid off. after watching the film I also realised older Star Wars fans may find it hard to accept what they see in this film. they even now say the most hateful things towards the film but its only cause they r very much attached to the original trilogy that they would have grown up with that again its hard for them to accept what it is now. but once again a great film.",The Last Jedi,459

positive,"  A journalist for Time Magazine wrote an article about this movie and stated that teens today don't need this movie; that in 2018 individuals like Simon have a good chance of fitting in, and it is unnecessary. Let me begin by saying he is wrong. This, first off, was a fantastic movie. It had a great mix of comedy, drama, and romance. That is something that is sorely lacking in LGBT film today. Many of them are far to serious and dramatic (""Call me by your name"", ""The Normal Heart"", Etc.) or are so flamboyant and ridiculous that no one can relate to it, but it is still a good movie (""Birdcage""). This is the only film that I have encountered that accurately portrays ones fears of coming out of the closet, and being in the closet trying to just survive high school. What this Time writer doesn't realize is that coming out is not just about ""fitting in"". In fact, many individuals coming out in high school worry because they are essentially painting a target on their back for bullying. It's terrifying because there are ultraconservative parents who kick their children out based on sexual orientation. Friends that get weird because they think ""What if this person thinks of me in that way?"". Coming out changes the dynamic between you and the people around you, and some people become hostile towards LGBT youth. Whenever I myself came out with my first boyfriend on Facebook someone from his friends list messaged me and told me ""What you are doing is wrong"". The fact that someone who is a complete stranger felt comfortable confronting me on my sexual orientation and thought it was their business to lecture me was just absurd. But anyway, as Simon said in the trailer for the movie, ""announcing who you are to the world can be pretty scary"", and I think really that is why this film is important. It reminds people that while coming out is terrifying, all that matters is that you are happy with who you are.",Love Simon,7610

Annihilation will leave your mind swimming within the Shimmer and this film will haunt your mind for days, weeks, and months on end.

The film's richly layered, deftly nuanced, insightful script, combined with gorgeous cinematography and an inventive production design, make for riveting viewing.

This is a fascinating visual trip into the unconscious mind. Unfortunately, some reviewers are unaware of the symbolism being used and are unable to interpret the film correctly which leads to them thinking the film ''doesn't make sense'' - the fear this film was 'too intellectual' for cinema release worldwide was clearly a valid concern.

With characters fully drawn both in animation and real human foibles, the unique story follows a young Mexican boy pursuing his dream to play music in a family that has banned all music. Delving deeply into Mexican cultural history, that is revelatory but not dogmatic, it traces a story that is not predictable and always fascinating. Without any stereotypes of character or traditional Disney story line, it illuminates ideas of death, growing up family and pursuing one's dreams at all costs.

positive,"  A well done, funny, sweet film. The story of a young man who has a 'secret' he's afraid to share with even his closest friends is well acted brings both laughter and tears. The reaction of his classmates runs the gamut of emotions and the audience is drawn in by the portrayal of this young man's struggle not only with navigating high school but doing so while trying to guard his secret. A very good way to spend an evening.",Love Simon,7496
positive,"  A well-done film, to me, is one that keeps me purely entertained, doesn't contain many, if any, plot holes, is finely acted, and keeps me positively engaged. This is that type of film. The one thing to remember: this is a pure fantasy-type film. However, the real-world ridiculousness of corporate entities spending tons of money just to earn tons more money, at the expense of anyone and anything, is purely evident here. And the cliched ""little people"" against the ""big people"" theme is certainly played out here. But it works and it works really well. I love the fact that this movie used relative unknowns for all of the major roles. I was only familiar with Tye from the X-Men movie. Simon, I'm a huge fan of, but he wasn't a main character. The others, I've never seen before. The American accents from Ben and Simon were perfect. This movie kept me completely engaged from the word ""go"". Its pace kept my adrenaline going and its homages to the 80's were perfection, though it is hard for me to fathom that no other significant anthem songs were released between 1980 and 2045. This movie was pure entertainment, for entertainment purposes. And I absolutely loved it.",Ready Player One,1390

positive,"  A wonderful fantastic animation of brilliant colour, song and true heart and soul. I didn't know much about this film before seeing it and was drawn into story and character, richly interwoven with Mexican culture and family history. Exceptional acting from the young star, Anthony Gonzalez, whose singing voice was a delightful surprise. I'm sure this young star will have a brilliant career ahead. I loved the themes in this film that digs deeply into our need for family connection.",Coco,5206
positive,  A wonderful movie with great throwbacks to the original as well as amazing action/comedy. My whole family loved it.,Jumanji,6151
positive,"  A wonderful presentation of the struggles faced by Christians. I have heard many say it should have been called ""Luke"" but I disagree strongly. This movie focused on Paul, his writings, his message, his struggles. Luke played a supporting role bridging the gap between Paul in the Roman prison and the Christians imprisoned in their hideaway in Rome. The emotional struggles and hardships endured for the faith of both were handled realistically. Acting was excellent and believable. The ending was especially moving.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7727

Tale as old as time, an unrequited love affair, this Guillermo del Toro fantasy drama not only features incredible acting by the remarbke pool of talent but also an amazing production overall.

I took 10 kids to see the move and as you can imagine I had a lot invested in this being awesome. Guess what? I really enjoyed the film and the vision. I have read a bunch of the personal reviews and it's ironic that most of the things people dont like are specific to the story in the book. This is a very very hard story to adapt to the screen, there is so much internal struggle and sweetness, despair, Darkness, Light and spirituality in the book. I love the attempt, the vision and the result. WAS it perfect, no. Was it wonderful, yes.",A Wrinkle in Time,3506

positive,"  Absolute joy for children and adults of any cultures.Having not seen any Pixar movies since Brave came out, I wasn't sure where to set my expectations for this movie, so I was very surprised at how much I loved it.One of my main concerns going into it was that I would either find the movie unrelatable or that it would serve the foreign culture in a social justice warrior manner. I was wrong. Very wrong. The movie is a natural insight into the Mexican culture (specifically the Day of the Dead) that is both engaging, interesting and inclusive. It doesn't feel like it's just Hollywood pandering to an audience, it doesn't abuse stereotypes of what the executives think people might like or want to see and most importantly they didn't whitewash the cast.The premise alone is extremely unique and engaging, throughout the whole movie it kept me guessing what would happen next. It's fast-paced, colourful, the characters are very well thought through. I was most amazed at the quality of the animation, it's absolutely mind-boggling, every little tiny detail that you would never even notice is there. It all really feels like a work of art that celebrates the Mexican culture. I also really enjoyed the fact that it had a fresh story structure where the world isn't ending and the hero doesn't have to defeat the ultimate evil but rather focuses on human issues and values.In fact, it's one of those rare movies that had me bawling my eyes out at the theatre.Anyways, I wanted to keep this review short and not go into deep details because it's worth experiencing.Coco is fun, emotional and fresh!

positive,  Absolutely incredible. One of the best films I've seen in a VERY long time. I wanted to go watch it again the second that I walked out of the theatre.,Love Simon,7514
positive,"  Absolutely incredible. The entire film itself was a reflection of the theme on mutation: it subtly mutated from drama to sci-fi to horror and back again, unnerving the viewer with each unexpected shift; it disturbs for the same reason the creatures and order within the Shimmer disturbs: it defies and refuses to follow the natural laws of what typically trust to expect. I understand why someone who wants to see a tidy sci-fi action movie would leave thinking this is a muddled mess, but it was so much more. As a biologist, this movie was incredible to watch, and spoke to so many of my constant thoughts on the tension between our brain's need to construct a sense of permanence as we move around this world (our personal narratives, the physical presence of our bodies, our inability to truly comprehend death) and the fact of the matter that the natural world and our inherent biology is simply a constant assault on any sort of stasis. Physically, we are different people at the end of each day with cell death and cell growth. Mentally, we are different people each year with the burden of new experiences. This movie took that tension and amplified it (and sped it up) to an incredible degree, using this to showcase how life is ultimately death is ultimately life, and that any sense of boundaries or borders that we may imagine as bodies with skin to close us off from the world is nothing but a lark: we are permeable bags of organic matter, and every minute that passes leaves us changed. Whew, this movie. There are a hundred other themes to speak on, including our inherent bent toward self destruction - the ego's way of coping with the incomprehensible fact of our ultimate demise - getting in one's own way, the weight of new experiences, the profound indifference of nature (watching this film took me back to my first read of Steven Crane's ""The Open Boat""), mutations, etc. TL;DR: If you're looking for a tidy sci-fi action flick, this isn't it. If you're fascinated by the natural world, and wonder about the tension between our brain's need for a sense of status and the inherent chaos and assault of constant change by the natural world on everything it entails, check this out. Whether you love it or not, it'll make your brain buzz for a little while, at least, and it's a whole lot of fun.",Annihilation,4027

positive,"  Absolutely loved it. I'm a Tomb Rider fan, and I was nervous after watching the promos, that they were going to ruin it, but I went because I'm a fan. Well, I was not disappointed. Alicia Vikander brought the spunk, grit, and down right stubbornness you would expect from a young Lara Croft. Most of all, the casting choices were well made.

Perhaps my biggest complaint, was why did it take so long for this character to make it to the screen? Why did we have to endure multiple Iron Man's, when this single film is better than all three (and the Avengers) combined? Great action, tempo and acting. No throw-away characters! The director was spot-on, didn't shy away from tough subjects, but wove a tale that was uniquely appealing to the entire audience.

positive,"  Adorable, humorous, charming and a heartwarming tale just in time for Easter and spring! You will be hopping as fast as you can to catch up with the rabbits and all the other animals that are, once again, calculating how to get into Mr. McGregor's Garden. Peter Rabbit is based on the books by Beatrix Potter. Beatrix Potter lived from 1866 to 1943 and is one of the best-loved children's authors. She wrote and illustrated 28 books and each one has been translated into more than 35 languages. They have sold over 100 million copies. This is important because one of the main goals for the director and the cast was to stay true to her vision. The beauty of this film is that the rabbits all look as if you could touch them because the animation is so life like. The scenes with the garden and house look like places that I would enjoy living because they look like a fairytale that came alive. Of course, if you don't share your vegetables your life will not be enjoyable. The moral of the film is about getting along with others, telling the truth and being honest. Everyone makes mistakes and we need to find a way to fix them. Thump, click, crack, snap, thud - all these noises, plus thousands of other sounds effects add to the humor of this film. The music is outstanding. I cannot wait to purchase the soundtrack. There is a combination of movie symphony music, sounds from the 80s, new original songs and a plethora of songs and sounds that will put a smile on your face. Of course, the comical James Corden makes a perfect bunny. Peter Rabbit is my favorite character, full of sassy and classy moves and words of wisdom. His humorous and quick-witted lines made me burst out laughing when I watched the film. He also has a very kind heart, which I love. Corden brings his quirky personality that we see on his late night television show to this part.On the other hand, I also love the adorable Flopsy (Margot Robbie). She is so cute and cuddly, knows how to fend for herself and I just love her. She is the perfect role model for kids because she teaches how you can be both smart, cute and a fighter. Margot Robbie adds a bit of quirkiness to this character because she is the one and only Harley Quinn. She is the complete opposite - serious and tough - in the recent movie Christopher Robin. I loved meeting her in person.My favorite scene is when Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) is electrified by the bunnies. This scene is absolutely hilarious and quirky. I could not stop laughing. Seeing bunnies figuring out how to use an electric fence was shocking. Ever caring, kind Bea (Rose Byrne) is the sweetest. She is the hero who protects the animals at all costs. I relate to her a lot. She is funny and a bite odd. Cotton-Tail (Daisy Ridley) is one tough bunny. You know that this film is magnificent when the star of Star Wars appears in it. Cotton-Tail is young, yet very feisty and tough. It reminds me of her character in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I recommend this film for ages 6 to 18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. Kids will adore the bunnies and the other talking animals. The teenagers will love the hummer and fun scenes that the younger kids don't understand. This film is a perfect for the entire family so grab a bag of carrots, radishes and turnips and head to the theaters.Reviewed by morgan b., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org",Peter Rabbit,7887

positive,"  After being released in December 2017, this film FINALLY made it around to the desolate corner of the world I inhabit, and I couldn't be more thrilled! While the trailers do glimpse the premise of the film, they also fall far short of revealing the true humanity (both heartfelt and horrifying) on display by the time the credits roll. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins embody the fragility and insecurity and aloneness we all feel (or have at times felt), and their redemption in the arms of an unlikely (soul) remind us that life is about our relationships with (and treatment of) each other.",The Shape of Water,9261

This magically, magnificent, marvelous and masterfully animated film directed by Toy Story 3's Lee Unkrich is not only an outstanding visually authentic and unique in style, it's also deeply affectionate and endearing when examining it's cultural contextual nature and hugely impactful themes focusing on life, death and the meaning of family relationship's. Not once did I feel this film was going off the rails of it's outstanding plotting, bringing in all the goods a great story needs set within an authentic world full of imaginative ideas and laws, much like it's outstanding musical score and song lyrics being a great sub-text for the film. I adored the film and can't recommend it highly enough to even both children and adults who'll equally cry during the most moving and intimate moments of the film. Overall, laugh, cry, smile and enjoy this outstanding achievement Pixar has created being another one of their greatest ever animated films ever made especially within the ever growing and innovative realm of compute generated 3D animation that shows the world Pixar are still the greatest pioneers of it's medium, both animation and conceptually story-wise beyond any belief.",Coco,5464

positive,"  Alex Garland plus Natalie Portman plus Sci-fi Horror, A must see movie indeed.",Annihilation,4476
positive,"  Alex Garland's directorial debut, Ex Machina, was a sleeper hit. He returns three years later with Annihilation; a film that defies your expectations of science fiction. You won't believe what you see, much like the characters in the movie question their surroundings. Packed with mystery and ambiguity, resting on the foundation of biology, it evokes a sense of curiosity. The concept of going into an otherworldly geographical area reminded me of Arrival, while the final 30 minutes had the same scope and dubious wonder as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Annihilation is your modern day Space Odyssey, and Garland is a modern day Kubrick. This is a spectacle to behold, and if you're an intellectual, it'll resonate with you for days, weeks, or even months. I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't wait to see it again.",Annihilation,4731
positive,"  Alex Garland's follow-up to 2015's fantastic 'Ex Machina' is a fascinating film, even before you sit down and watch it. Firstly, it has had a less than conventional journey to our screens - under the weight of a big budget, and underwhelming test audience reviews, Paramount decided to cut their losses and sell it to Netflix for a fee that doesn't even cover half of it's costs, so sure were they of it proving a box-office bomb. Secondly, Garland refused to bow to pressure and make radical changes to his film, to compromise his vision, in order to ensure studio support. His decision was ultimately entirely justified.Based on the apparently 'unfilmable' Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation focuses on a five-strong, all-female, expedition that sets out to investigate a mysterious 'shimmer' that has appeared, killing everyone who has dared enter it, which threatens to expand rapidly and envelop the planet. Each member of the crew, offers a profession or speciality, that they hope can unravel the mystery, and indeed unravelling takes place, but not of the intended kind - Natalie Portman leads the cast, in a performance as good as any in her back catalogue, which is a low-bar I will admit, but this is easily up to her 'Black Swan' best. There is equally fine support from her cast-mates, including a wonderfully understated showing from Jennifer Jason Leigh.Where the film is a success, is in taking a well established horror formula of having a group of players, picked off one by one by a malevolent force, and using it not as the focus but as a means to an end. The set-pieces are understated and infrequent, though brutal, but necessary to understanding the bigger picture. It is refreshing too, to have a group of characters reacting intelligently to the events surrounding them, and too for a film to have a group of women at it's centre. A rarity for a movie of this type. Yet gender is never referred to throughout. It is not used as a plot device or indeed intended to be some kind of feminist message. Technically, the film is a marvel. Garland has created a vision that is both of this earth, and yet other-worldly at the same time. With natural elements given mutated optics to create a location that plays into the unease felt by the characters the deeper they venture into it. The final sequence, that runs for a good 20 minutes, devoid of dialogue, is as 'out there' as anything I have seen in a studio picture for quite some time. The accompanying soundtrack by Portishead instrumentalist Geoff Barrow, is something else here, complementing a scene that will serve as nightmare-fuel for this viewer for some time to come, not because of any gore or indeed scare, but for the sense of anxiety it creates.You can understand why Paramount bailed on the project, especially after the chance they took with last year's 'mother!' which proved to be box-office poison for them, but their loss is ultimately Netflix's gain. A fine addition to their catalogue and easily one of the best films I have seen this year.",Annihilation,4308
positive,  Alex Garland's sophomore film is nothing short of perfect. The visuals in this high-concept sci-fi horror film in conjunction with the performances given by the exceptionally talented women in it are only two of reasons this film is destined to be a classic.,Annihilation,4598

positive,"  Amazing movie. There are times when it's clichÈ but its easy to forget because then you realize the main characters are gay. I felt the clich√© scenes were put on purpose to make sure everyone reaizes that gay or straight the same moments happen in gay relationships as well as straight ones. Scene as simple as going to school and having crushes work in similar ways as heterosexual people, but the only difference is that the self-acceptance and societal acceptance portion gets in the way. I believe the movie does a great job at pointing out that gay people should, can, and do deserve a romantic movie about them without the hypersexualization or self-destruction.

positive,  An emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance.,The Shape of Water,9337
positive,"  An enchanting visual masterpiece. The Shape of Water challenges your notions of human empathy and shirks the norms of a tired Hollywood with its daring and unapologetic dive into an exploration of human fantasy, love and repression. Sally and Richard's onscreen performance is unnervingly convincing to the point that it hurts to think that they are acting their characters and not exposing their secret reality. The only true pain, however, in seeing the movie was coming to realize how predictable the plot is. Major plot points begin to unravel long after it is obvious what must happen for the story to advance. An unfortunate lack of surprise. With that said, this can stand on its own just as a work of art if not even a film but it makes a stellar film even where it needs not to.",The Shape of Water,9221

positive,"  Annihilation (2018) is a perfect work of science fiction and one of my favorite movies of the last decade. The acting, effects, and story are all top notch. There are many familiar elements and tropes, but it exceeds its precursors while adding something new. A gorgeous movie! A+",Annihilation,4285
positive,"  Annihilation (2018) is a very intense, off the wall sci-fi movie that is filled with death, love, stunning visuals, and a bit of horror. The best part about Annihilation is that there is an all-female lead cast which is really significant and sends a statement considering the circumstances in Hollywood pertaining to gender. Not only are they bad ass women but they are also smart women who are each a different type of scientist, and that isn't something we see too often in these types of movies or in movies at all. I give Annihilation 5 out of 5 stars for keeping me entertained throughout the entirety of it and for making me want to read the novel that it is based off of. Usually I read the book and then watch the movie but that wasn't the case for Annihilation. If the movie is this good then the book has the be mind-blowing.  I really enjoyed the way Director Alex Garland set up the story, he cuts between past and present scenes throughout the movie. He gives us the background of Lena, the main character of the movie, and the life she is living as a biologist professor at Johns Hopkins. She hasn't seen or heard from her husband in a year. He shows up and it's as if his memory has been completely wiped away. His health starts to deteriorate quickly and the government takes Kane and Lena to Area X and she learns of ""the shimmer"" This is where the movie starts to get mind-altering, almost hallucinatory.  The shimmer is a place that defies the laws of nature, is drenched in colors and is visually striking. Garland makes the shimmer seem like a place of fantasy and a place that you would want to spend time in until something very dark emerges. That dark is the unknown and a place that is changing at a fast rate. There are flowers that are all the same species but very different looking. The animals that were once normal are evolving into monsters that have never been seen. In the very first scary scene there is an alligator that looks like an alligator but isn't quite like the alligators we are used to seeing. Not only is everything around them changing but they are changing as well. The group of women have to deal with this prism that refracts everything, with their own minds and if they can trust each other or not which is pretty great to watch because I think most people would feel the same way. I believe a soundtrack can make or break a movie and Annihilation's soundtrack definitely made the movie. The darkest parts are accompanied by equally dark music. Not only are we seeing some pretty horrific scenes we are hearing music that helps those goosebumps run from head to toe. Music that makes you feel as if you are actually there experiencing every bit of the shimmer. The music was never over used but used at just the right times, filled with intensity and made you feel disoriented. The swimming pool scene is by far one of the creepiest and the music really contributes to that creepiness, like nails on a chalkboard. In this scene we see the body of a man, who was part of a previous group that entered the shimmer, stuck up on the wall of the deep end of a swimming pool. The music we hear in this scene is not really music at all but more like an alarm that gets louder and louder as we see this body that has mutated in to something very out of this world.There's nothing worse than watching a movie with terrible acting, especially when you pay to see it in a theater. The acting in Annihilation is good and Natalie Portman does an excellent job in my opinion. I have seen a few movies she has done in the past where I thought she didn't do too well (Where the Heart Is) but she blew me away in Annihilation, she makes you feel like you aren't watching a movie. One scene that I think she did incredibly well in is the scene when she gets to the lighthouse and the humanoid emerges from the hole in the wall. She is watching this humanoid mimic her but it's a CGI character. She moves beautifully and makes it seem like the humanoid isn't CGI at all but rather a real person.Gareth Edwards Monsters (2010) has a similar plot to Annihilation's but one is far better than the other. The quality of Annihilation out weights Monsters by far. I'm sure budget has something to do with this but I was quite bored while watching Monsters, and I was on the edge of my seat, beginning to end while watching Annihilation. Garland gives us just the right amount of background on the main characters and Edwards' entire movie is focused entirely on the background. If I am going to watch a sci-fi movie about aliens I want to see more of the aliens. There's nothing wrong with a little romance in a sci-fi movie but that's all I saw in Monsters.Garland is giving us more questions than answers in Annihilation and I like movies like this because they keep us talking after the movie has ended. I watched this movie with my significant other and we left the theater with a bizarre feeling that's almost impossible to put into words, like a disconnect between mind and body and not unlike the otherworldly sensation of tripping on mushrooms. We talked about the movie for the entirety of our thirty-minute drive home and I think that says a lot about how well this movie is made. If you are in to sci-fi movies that are filled with great acting, great music, great visuals, and a great story then you will most likely enjoy Annihilation.",Annihilation,3870
positive,  Annihilation is a genre busting story. the path and life of natalie portman's character is riveting. The visuals are striking and disturbing in a very human way. this movie will be talked about for many years. great movie making from one the best directors of our time.,Annihilation,4348
positive,"  Annihilation is a rare treat for those that love exciting and intelligent movies. It is full of beautiful imagery, bad ass women, and perhaps the most terrifying antagonist I have ever seen. Just like the primordial soup that gave birth to life on Earth, the ""shimmer"" has arrived by accident and is driven without logic or meaning towards a will to live. The expression of this idea is marvelously executed and a feast for the eyes. I've seen it twice and both times the theater was nearly silent. Everyone was glued to the screen and waiting with bated breath as the story unraveled chaotically, mysteriously, perfectly in front of us.",Annihilation,4129

positive,"  Annihilation is at once intelligent, horrifying, beautiful, emotionally resonant and deeply thought-provoking - all the hallmarks of great science fiction.If you happen to be in Canada, China, or the US, go see it on the big screen!",Annihilation,4605
positive,"  Annihilation is directed by Alex Garland, and is based off of a massively successful novel by Jeff VanderMeer. This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and having finally seen it, I am blown away. Annihilation is incredible. Alex Garland had already knocked it out of the park with Ex Machina, and Annihilation is even better. This is full on 2001 style insanity, and it is glorious. Everything about this movie is so finely crafted and carefully constructed that the finished product is like almost nothing i've ever seen. The performances are all exceptional, especially from Natalie Portman. She has a lot of difficult work do, and she handles it with such a resolve. The standout in the film, is how it looks. Alex Garland has crafted a visual wonder. Then comes the end. No spoilers, but the final 20 minutes of the film are so insane, that the only thing I can compare it to is the ending of 2001. This movie also has one of the scariest scenes of the decade so far. Again no spoilers, but the way tension is created is masterful. Honestly, 2018 is gonna have to try really hard to give me a movie that is better than Annihilation.",Annihilation,4647
positive,"  Annihilation is many things. Beautiful. Otherworldly. Unsettling. Terrifying. Bizarre. Any many more. But above all it is brilliant. As horror, action thriller, high concept sci-fi and deeply introspective psychological study it works on every level. It's not a movie for the casual filmgoer, or one that is easy to wrap your head around. But for experienced viewers prepared to have their minds blown, Annihilation is a real treat.The premise is that Natalie Portman is Lena, a biologist who has lost her husband and travels into an area of altered reality called ""the Shimmer"" to learn what happened to him. No one knows to expect when they go in, because only one barely conscious person has ever returned. But nothing could prepare them- or the viewer- for what they find inside.They're on Earth. There are touches of the familiar all around. Abandoned shacks, bayous, alligators. But at the same time the inside of the Shimmer is in many ways a beautiful and alien as Pandora. It's not often you feel compelled to comment on the vegetation in a movie, but the flowers and trees they encounter are simply gorgeous, filling the screen will a whirl of colors completely at odds with the film's tone. The creatures on the other hand are pure nightmare fuel. They're recognizable animals but twisted in horrifying ways that hint at the deeper corruption all around them.Most of the best horror movies work because they stand as a metaphor for our deepest and most common fears. Alien was Rape. The Babadook stood for overwhelming grief. And Annihilation is about guilt, paranoia, and utter mental and emotional breakdown. It's fascinating and more than a little unsettling to watch how each of the main characters slowly become unhinged as they try and fail to come to terms with what they're experiencing. Some display an ever-growing sense of fatalism. Others flat out denial, or overpowering suspicion. In a movie where so much is utterly alien, their breakdowns are surprisingly realistic and nuanced. This could have worked solely as a psychological horror film. But of course the filmmakers weren't content to stop there. There's extremely frightening imagery and bits of gore, used sparingly enough to retain their full impact. The found footage from a previous expedition is literally stomach churning and will probably be too much for many viewers. There are even good jump scares. And oh, how the movie can build suspense. As they go deeper into the Shimmer the tension builds and builds and is held so long as to be almost unbearable. And the ending is simply beyond anything most viewers have ever seen. There are no words to adequately describe it, and to even try would spoil it. Suffice it to say that you will be in a state of utter wonder and bewilderment. There are many things about it I don't understand. But then they're probably not meant to be understood, or even possible to understand. The final act of this movie is Akira level mind-bending. It makes 2001 or Inception look simple and unambiguous. I have my own interpretations of some parts, which I think are what filmmakers intended. But for so many aspects there are no firm answers, only endless possibilities and the questions they create. And that may be the true genius of this movie. For all the terror, the wonder, and the wonderful acting, perhaps what Annihilation succeeds at the most is how much it will make you think.",Annihilation,4435

This movie is one of the best Pixar movies in terms of overall visuals, songs, emotional plateaus and finding something redeeming in humanity...While no movie may ever exceed Toy story in the Pixar library this movie reminds you why Pixar studios is animation and story telling at its absolute finest.",Coco,5050

positive,"  Anyone who knows me knows I'm one of the harshest MCU critics. So don't take this lightly & believe me when I say this, ""Black Panther"" is a true masterpiece.The costume design department did a terrific job of encompassing clothing styles from different African cultures & blending them with some slick modern touches thus creating some of the most beautifully colourful costumes the MCU has ever sewn.A film such as this one is unavoidably CGI-heavy. So a special care must be taken into smoothing everything & mixing it all together. This film, albeit the final battle which looked a bit cartoonish, did so meticulously. The way Wakanda's technological advancements are presented is a sight to be seen & the attention to even the smallest detail is something I always highly appreciate.The score or soundtrack, in my opinion, is one of the most critical aspects of a film. It can single-handedly destroy, pass through unnoticed or elevate a film. I must admit, going in & by the very few promotional materials I had watched beforehand, I had a completely different idea of how the film's score was going to sound. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Both Ludwig G√∂ransson & Kendrick Lamar did an exceptional job & created an organic & befitting score.The amount of acting talent brought together for ""Black Panther"" felt uncommonly high for an MCU film, so much so that I almost felt starstrucked. Major acting names such as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya & many more, made their MCU debut & I have to say, they did an absolutely terrific job.Lupita Nyong'o was really good & thankfully her character wasn't reduced to the typical ""love interest"" but instead is shown as a badass warrior & a philanthropist who will always speak her mind no matter what. Of course, the trophy for the most absolute badass character of them all must go to none other than ""Okoye"" (Danai Gurira), the forever-loyal Wakandan general of the ""Dora Milaje"". Let's just say you should never get on her cross-hairs if you know what's good for you. My new favourite MCU supporting character is ""Shuri"" who is brought to life by Letitia Wright. Let us hope she gets a good chunk of screen-time during ""Infinity War"" in order to develop her character because I desperately want to see much more of her. Andy Serkis exudes a level of craziness, almost on a psychopathic level, that has left me in awe of his acting chops, even without the use of the motion capture technology he so much adores.Last but certainly not least, a couple of big names surrounding the film, the protagonist Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) & the antagonist Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). Chadwick portrays a Prince trying to step into the shoes of a King & realizing it's a task that hides many dangers & secrets. What more can be said about Chadwick after such a performance other than he has now become the embodiment of Black Panther & it'll be difficult watching him in other roles in the future. A special mention must specifically be made to Michael B. Jordan who has now officially joined the list of actors who have redeemed themselves for previous comic-book movie roles. After 10 years, Michael brings to life the MCU's 1st formidable villain who is completely serious, doesn't joke around, means business & at the same time is a villain the audience can actually relate to. Throughout the film, viewers develop a level of sympathy towards him despite his violent tendencies & can understand where he is coming from, even somewhat justify his actions by taking into account all that he had to endure. Michael B. Jordan is indeed phenomenal in this film & delivers one of the most (if not the most) powerful & memorable lines in the entirety of the MCU. A phrase that manages to stick with you even several days after viewing the film. Since my reviews tend to be spoiler-free, I'll not be adding it here. Those who have watched the film surely know which one I'm referring to. As for the rest of you, what the hell are you even still doing here? Go watch the film.""Black Panther"" is a contemporary comic-book movie gem, a proof that the age of comic-book movies is not yet over. A further testament that comic-book movies can still produce original, fresh ideas that shelter deep, thought-provoking messages of female empowerment as well as racial & people of color recognition, appreciation & representation while at the same time challenging some misguided sociopolitical norms that are bleeding our planet & its inhabitants.(Updated from 15/02/2018)",Black Panther,2663

positive,"  As a fan of the book (Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda), I was both thrilled and nervous to see the movie. I got my tickets for the Thursday night premiere, and the first thing I noticed was the composition of the audience in the theatre. Excluding me, every single group of people in attendance had a preteen or teenager (many of them in rainbow shirts or wearing rainbow bracelets) and what appeared to be their parents or grandparents. I could have cried. Have you ever been in a movie with LGBTQ teens or their allies and their parents? What a world we live in.The movie was sweet, touching, hilarious, moving -- I could give you a thousand similar words. What struck me most, however, were the changes made from the original source material. I realized halfway through the movie that the book was the gay rom-com that LGBTQ teens wanted... but the movie was the story that we all needed. There's one scene that was added from the book between Simon and his mother that will give closure to every one of us who had a rough coming out experience. My last comment about this movie: I'm a very stoic movie-goer who doesn't tend to laugh out loud or cry. My eyes were burning with tears at parts. I burst out laughing multiple times. I actually screamed in a cheer at one point at the end. People in the theatre applauded. Please see this movie. Not only is it very well-made, but I have faith that this is going to be the key to truly bringing LGBTQ romance to mainstream movies.",Love Simon,7393
positive,"  As a fan of the novels, I've been highly anticipating Annihilation, and it was worth the wait. This movie changes the narrative more than enough to separate itself from the novel with it's great performances, stunning visuals, interesting and mysterious story, and scares. The film was very enjoyable to watch and pretty immersive, however I did find there was a formula to advance the plot once or twice which became a little noticeable but didn't cause any issues. And similar to the novel, it left viewers wondering and pondering over the film's mysteries and events which will lead into the next film, making it a film to remember for quite a while. Overall, Annihilation is a fantastic film with a strong story and well performed and leaves the viewer desiring for more.",Annihilation,4163

positive,  As a love time fan of the video game and of Alicia Vikander I have to say this film is amazing! It captures the true essence of the game and it's characters. While I would have liked more to see Lara battle with the main antagonist that doesn't hurt the film. The acting was spot on especially between Lara and her father. Great Tomb Raider moments and Alicia Vikander is a solid Lara Croft! I hope this movie gets a sequel. Not perfect but definitely a solid film and worth the watch.,Tomb Raider,9727
positive,"  As a lover of scifi... This is among my top three that I've ever seen. A mind-bending mystery that slowly unravels against a darkly beautiful and truly original interpretation of a mutated section of Earth. The story has a huge amount of heart, as do all the characters, which really tie the whole thing together. So many scifi movies are cold, distant, stylish, and devoid of feeling. Not this one. The soundtrack was perfectly paired with each scene... Simple folk guitar pickings as the troop wanders The Shimmer, as well as viscerally haunting synth layers with choral voices and strings. I just saw it for the second time and appreciated it even more. I left the theater both times with an elevated sensation in my mind; I like that this film made me not only think, but go through an actually mind-opening experience. A true art piece.",Annihilation,4584
positive,"  As a major fan of the games since the first game, i was very worried I would hate this film, but I really enjoyed it. I think they did an excellent job with the pacing of this film. The story to action ratio is very reminiscent of a lot of the games in the franchise. The character doesn't feel quite like the Lara Croft we were expecting to see, but that's because she isn't... Yet. This story aims to show how an ambitious, grounded, and adventurous girl becomes the badass, skilled, and experienced Tomb Raider we know and love. Optimistic for the next film.",Tomb Raider,9726
positive,"  As an 18 year old lesbian, this movie struck a major cord with me. Maybe I'm bias, but this movie blew me away.

The art of this movie brought the time period to life and put me in the time and place the earliest Christians experienced. They were just beginning to grow in Faith and sacrificed so much. Bringing the words of the Bible to life is extremely personal for me since that is what I try to do in my devotions. This movie made me think in ways I never had about the life of Paul. Go see this movie! I pray this movie will touch all that see it and bring them to a deeper, personal relationship with God.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7751
positive,"  As I sat back in the comfy leather seats and watched the star-dusted opening credits roll out in front of me, I reminisced about what it felt like watching the Star Wars series for the first time. It has been a long time since that happened and my only hope was that Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be just as mind-boggling as the others. Shame on me for ever doubting the legendary billion-dollar franchise, because (spoiler alert): It is!If you haven't seen the previous installment, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, then I highly recommend you grab some friends to watch it with and get yourself back on track. Otherwise, you will be in for a big surprise. For those who have seen it, then you know that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) makes an iconic return to the big screen and this time, with a vengeance. Luke went into hiding, undetected, to the Porg-infested island of Ahch-To to die. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has a mission to bring Luke back to fight the Resistance as war is once again brewing against the First Order. Millions of porg-encounters later, Rey finally persuades Luke to lend her his knowledge in combat, leaving Luke unsettled by the strength of her powers.This time around, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) leads the Resistance due to unforeseen circumstances. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Holdo go head to head as he refuses to follow Holdo's rules. This creates major conflict in the storyline, as some things don't necessarily go as planned during combat. We are also introduced to a new lead character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker that guards the escape pods. She bonds with Finn (John Boyega) as she takes him to her wealthy home of Canto Bight. Though, there's so much more to this planet than meets the eye.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains high and mighty, just for show. It's evident that he hides something deep within, something he cannot control - a slight hint of compassion. After a head-to-head conflict with Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), the film finally reveals who he truly is.Now that you have an idea of what the film is about, let's talk about the magic that goes on behind-the-scenes. To be quite honest, the writing has its lows. There are moments when the audience would let out an uncomfortable laugh due to the awkward, juvenile jokes that we know certain characters would never say or do. It felt somewhat out-of-touch with the Star Wars franchise, especially since they are thrown in during the most serious, suspenseful scenes. Despite that, the rest of the screenplay is groundbreaking. It gives the audience what they want and what they didn't know they needed. Also, the cinematography is phenomenal. Shooting in locations such as Ireland and Croatia, the visual effects team make it seem as though they are off in a galaxy far, far away, without straying from its natural beauty. Special effects, as always, are mind-blowing. It's nearly impossible not to fathom lightsabers being real. Top it all off with detailed costume design and award-winning acting, and you've got yourself a masterpiece.Ultimately, Star Wars: The Last Jedi exceeded far beyond my expectations, and I urge you to go out with your Jedi Knight robes and lightsabers and experience it on the big screen. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 as well as adults.

positive,"  As of February 23rd 2018, there are now two movies that genuinely scare me. Pans Labyrinth and Annihilation. The concept of 'the shimmer' presented a terrifying nightmare fueled by science and the unknown and in all honesty, I've never had sweaty palms for so long. The antagonist was refreshingly alien, the lack of intention and confusion presenting a childlike force of rebirth. Though the film could have stood on its two legs with gorgeous visuals alone, every scene was highlighted by an amazing score and sound design. This movie was clearly written for cinema, as I felt utterly encapsulated by noise. Every note demanded my attention. On the surface, its one of my favourite horror movies - and that's what I thought as I walked out of the theatre. But Annihilation isn't a film that you forget about on the drive home. Or as you lay awake in bed trying not to think about screaming bears (How DARE you, Alex Garland). It demands a closer look and as you pick it apart piece by piece, each element shines under examination. Horror film, trippy science fiction, cerebral film about self destruction; there's something for everyone.",Annihilation,4446

positive,"  As someone who has never written a film review in my life, Love, Simon has sparked me to do so. It's a film simple in its plot, but hits you on so many emotional levels. It isn't merely a rom-com filled with hysterical roasts and that ""trying-to-figure-things-out"" vibe that often dominates teenage life, but also resonates the struggle of being unaccepted--the excruciating wonder of ""what would happen"" if I came out, ""what if"" they knew this about me, or ""would things change"" if I just let it all out? Both the sense of exasperating dread before coming out and the awkward relief after saying ""I'm gay"" rings true throughout the extent of Love, Simon. Thank you for making this, and let me just say... finally.",Love Simon,7542
positive,"  As someone who is gay, it's awesome to see people like me be in the forefront of a big budget hollywood movie. This was the first time I truly related to a movie geared to people my age, especially with him struggling to come out to friends and family. It honestly felt so refreshing to watch a cheesy teen romcom that's not about your typical straight couple. I didn't even realize how much I needed something like this until I started to watch it, and it just hit me that there's almost nothing out there in mainstream media that centers around a same-sex couple. This movie is monumental to me and many other people, and I cannot even express how much it meant to have a gay teenager at the center of it. This is the first time I've felt represented in the media, and will hopefully pave the way for more stories of lgbt people in mainstream tv and movies.",Love Simon,7428

I played all the games, love the movies, collected the comic books and action figures, and did plenty of cosplay back in the day for contests and cons.This year's Tomb Raider - 2018 pulls the entire IP together with a totally believable Lara Croft. Brilliantly acted, this rendition took the time to flesh out Lara with an updated backstory and character arc that is touching and heartfelt.Gone are the campy villains of previous cinematic portrayals. Lara faces a truly desperate psychopath in her quest to discover the fate of her father. She gathers friends and allies that support the story admirably. Gone is the pandering body padding. Instead, we are treated to an athletic protagonist capable of meeting the physical challenges that confront her.Reckless, vulnerable, ambitious, independent, charismatic, and a little naive, Alicia Vikander as young Lara brings her origin story to life. Without pulling punches (literally), this movie magically incorporates both classic and contemporary game memes with a Lara who redefines today's vibrant female hero.And it's got action, puzzles, and pathos with a mere touch of humor. I just finished watching it the 3rd time, and it holds up to close scrutiny. Tomb Raider - 2018, I love what you've done with Lara. Can't wait for the sequel.",Tomb Raider,9431

positive,"  Beginning his career as an author and responsible for the source material of Danny Boyle's The Beach in 2000, Alex Garland then directly ventured into the film industry by doing screenplay's - again with Boyle on 28 Days Later and Sunshine - before he eventually took the reigns himself by making his directorial debut with the magnificent science fiction film Ex Machina in 2014. On this evidence, it's fair to say that Garland has went from strength to strength and his sophomore film, Annihilation, continues that trend. One could even argue that it's his best work yet.Plot: Lena (Natalie Portman), a cellular biologist and former soldier, joins an expedition to uncover what happened to her husband Kane (Oscar Issac) who disappeared during a mission inside Area X - a swampland across the Florida coastline that was hit by a meteor and is now a sinister and mysterious phenomenon that blocks all contact with the outside world. During the expedition, Lena discovers a world of mutated landscapes and creatures that threatens everything we have come to know about science and evolution and threatens not only her life but also her sanity. Based on the first book in the ""Southern Reach"" trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer we are drip fed the events and conundrum of Annihilation in the three stages of the characters' exploration: Area X, The Shimmer and The Lighthouse. Such is Garland's restrained approach, we are kept very much at arms length about what exactly is going as each of these chapters make little sense. When the film does provide some answers, it only opens it up to even more questions and therein lies the craftsmanship and intrigue of this abstract sci-fi fantasy. What's most apparent, though, is Garland's masterful control of pace and mood and it's his attention to these elements that provide the film with genuinely nightmarish possibilities. Area X is a foreboding, inhospitable land where the laws of physics and nature have turned in on themselves as the environment mutates with new and fascinating results. There are plants that share human DNA and result in growths of eerie, man-like tree structures and animals that retain and replicate the screams of the victims they've killed. Everything refracts as our planet, as we know it, is in the process of evolving into something else entirely. It's this very concept that makes Garland's film a terrifying experience. While it's beautifully shot by cinematographer Rob Hardy and boasts some visually stunning scenes it also has atmosphere in abundance. I've seen genre horrors that have failed to capture half of this films palpable feeling of dread and Garland knows exactly how to handle it's unsettling moments while aided with a hugely effective score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury.Harbouring the weighty themes of grief, suicide and self-destruction, Garland borrows heavily from the paranoia of John Carpenter's The Thing and also channels cancer as its psychological device, while many have compared it to Andrei Tarkovsky's 1979 metaphysical film, Stalker. Having recently caught up with that, I can definitely see the resemblance. Tarkovsky's film has a more reflective, philosophical tone to it whereas Garland explores a more scientific nature but the two are certainly bedfellows. Like Stalker, Annihilation refuses to provide easy answers and some might even leave the film frustrated with its ambiguity. However, it's this very ambiguous approach that contributes to the film's allure and fascinating premise. Needless to say, those not willing to put in the effort to work through its many layers will be left sorely disappointed and needn't bother at all. In fact, the film's production studio, Paramount Pictures, voiced their concern on it being too intellectual and complicated for the masses and decided not to release it widely in cinemas in fear of losing money. Instead, a deal was struck with Netflix to internationally distribute it on their streaming service. It's such a shame that films as bold and inventive as this are never given the confidence and respect they deserve. Paramount have been fools in their handling and marketing of this and can only hope that the film's reception doesn't suffer as a result.A haunting and genuinely frightening, sci-fi mystery that's as elliptical and unnerving as Tarkovsky's Stalker and as trippy as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey - with a plethora of other science fiction influences thrown in for good measure. It's only March but already we have one of the potential best films of 2018. This is a truly bold and intriguing undertaking from Alex Garland and he's laid down the gauntlet for the forthcoming year. Mark Walker",Annihilation,4069
positive,"  Being a Tomb Raider gamer my opinion?????out of 5. A Great Tomb Raider Origins movie. Captures the heart & theme of Tomb Raider. Game play moves, story, exploring, action & puzzles.One critic was scathing saying nothing new and that Alicia Vikander was a stoic & exasperated character. Well my friend Tomb Raider is survival. Maneuvering through varied treacherous terrain, life threatening obstacles and challenges -- no fun time ride.Alicia Vikander gave a GREAT performance.

positive,"  Black Panther has transcended the cookie cutter Marvel franchise. In seamlessly fusing science fiction with effective interpretations of African culture and design it has created a believable futuristic world. Set designs, costumes, music. In that context it places complex characters, and lets the audience experience with them the unfolding of unexpected information about people close to them. Lets the audience experience crushing defeats and transformations. Villains with complexity. Heroes with complexity. Layered story lines. So many characters doing the unexpected. This movie raises the bar for anyone attempting to adapt a comic book to the screen.",Black Panther,2604
positive,"  Black Panther is a great hero journey's story. Chadwick Boseman returns as the titular hero, and brings a king's gravitas to the role. Michael B Jordan plays a villain whose motives would not be out of place from a hero's. The stand out of the supporting cast is Letitia Wright whose Shuri, the little sister to T'Challa, is a playful nerd but when things get serious she will get her hands dirty in the action. Marvel has returned to its A game form.",Black Panther,2154
positive,"  Black Panther is a stunning movie with impressive graphics and a thrilling soundtrack. It does a wonderful job of immersing its viewers in a futuristic country, rich with influences from beautiful tribes that we rarely get to see on screen. This culturally rich visual masterpiece is a must see for anyone",Black Panther,2549
positive,"  Black Panther is a thing of beauty. What's really satisfying is that it is visual story telling at its best, and in my mind, one of the most engrossing and thoughtful action films coming out from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that breathes deep characterizations, fresh conversations and envisions new directions. Black Panther is fresh, unique and deep. Although the representation may be African, set in a fictional nation in Africa called Wakanda, the script is nuanced, multi-layered and transcends cultures. Black Panther resonates well with the global audience because it's a film that has a brave, convincing and intelligent script which offers a two-hour escapism into a fantasy world. As you leave the theatre, you leave with hope to walk strong in a troubled world, and be inspired to believe in a better future. The ensemble cast is nothing short of amazing: everyone unique, beautiful and talented. Marvel seems to always get its casting so perfect for its cinematic universe: always finding that very actor for that very role, so much so you can't imagine the character being anyone else other than that actor: case in point, I can't imagine Chadwick Boseman not being the regal and noble King T'Challa. The audience would be able to find visual catharsis in the story, especially through any one of the character arcs, men or women. Women would be inspired and feel empowered by the strength of Queen Mother Ramonda, the leadership of General Okoye, the spunk and intelligence of the teenage Princess Shuri or the idealism and independence of Nakia. Without a doubt, the big bouquet goes to Ryan Coogler - for his direction and screenplay - which borrows too from biblical themes of redemption, forgiveness, sacrifice, death and resurrection, and Shakespearean settings. Not forgetting the crew, indeed a work of artistry and great passion. The sets are a pungent of colours and simply magnificent - especially the waterfall coronation scene. Even the costumes. The focus on detail is simply astonishing. Phew. Without leaving any spoilers, regarding the antagonist Killmonger, Michael B. Jordan delivers some of the best lines of the film - which brings chills down our spines when we weigh how easily smart young people today are being radicalised, and how thin the line is between good and evil when the world falls into the hands of anarchists and fascists completely deceived by their misguided sense of right and wrong. Clearly, this film is a step in the right direction for the wellness of the future in filmmaking. This is a milestone, and a gamechanger.",Black Panther,2314
positive,"  Black Panther is an excellent film. It is about T'Challa who returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan give amazing performances. The screenplay is well written. Ryan Coogler did a great job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and drama. Black Panther is a must see.",Black Panther,1991

positive,  Black Panther!!!!!!!,Black Panther,2771
positive,"  Black Panther:Part cool demi-God Superhero, Part ""The Lion King"", Part 90s/early2000s Oakland: ""Black Panther"" is all awesome and much like Wonder Woman (2017) brings fresh perspectives to the genre and while may fall into some of the same ""tropes"" and has some questionable CGI and green screen decisions in its final act the story itself is so good and the character so engaging that one can forgive these nitpicks. ""Black Panther"" never lets on that it's even in the same universe as Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, and the rest. Feeling as fresh as a movie 10 years into the ""Marvel experiment"" can. and this is the closest Marvel has come to making a stand-alone tale in many years. Although this represents the first full outing for the Black Panther character (who made his debut in Captain America: Civil War), it's more of an ""introduction story"" than an ""origin story."" Coogler's approach is similar to the one Tim Burton used in 1989's Batman - don't waste the audience's time with a blow-by-blow description of how the Black Panther got his powers and what he initially does with them. Instead, tell a real story and sprinkle in the details along the way. It's a more satisfying method of storytelling that what we sometimes have to slog through with initial forays. As a result, Coogler's characters jump out of the screen - feeling as real and with as real a motivation as any have in the MCU to date.Everything about the design of the characters to the layout of the narrative seems to have been done with such a care and respect that it oozes out of each frame. A powerful story and driven by veteran direction pulling out emotional performances that we as an audience can empathize with. Much like his other works - Coogler has a really strong throughline in this film that carries his message of unity and empathy. All driven by performances that people can gush about for days. From Andy Serkis & Angela Bassett to Chadwick Boseman & Michael B. Jordan - everyone brings their ""A"" game. Black Panther is arguably the most audacious movie to emerge from the MCU to-date and has to be in the conversation when considering the all-time best comic book-inspired stories. Although the structure is rooted in the superhero tradition, the production rarely feels limited by that classification. It takes us to new places and sloughs off the generic label that adheres to many films of the genre, providing an experience that is by turns exciting, emotional, and funny.",Black Panther,2133

positive,"  Brilliantly performed, wounderfully adapted and produced. This movie is a must see. With so many of the movies being produced today lacking real dialogue and meaningful messages, Paul, Apostle of Christ stands out as a testament to powerful magnetic performances with life impacting messages. Jim Cavesiel, one of the best under rated actors of our time, masterfully accounts for Paul's last days as documented and witnessed in his portrayal of Luke. This movie does not require a knowledge of scripture to be enjoyed. It's also rather disappointing that the critics who view Christianity as a threat to secular liberalism feel like it's their duty to attack this movie. Look at the audience ratings or better yet, go see the film and judge for yourself.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7740

positive,"  Chadwick Boseman returns to don the power and suit of the Black Panther. This time in his own movie! After his father died, T'Challa finds himself in a novelty path of becoming what it is to be a true king of Wakanda but while being thwarted by something that was created a long time ago, an adversary by blood. The dark past catches up in T'Challa's life and not just him, but everyone around him are in danger. With the help of the people he trusts and love, the kingdom must be saved.Despite of what everyone is claiming it to be and don't get me wrong, this is by far the best Marvel comic book movie adaptation ever. Thor Ragnarok was just the tip of the iceberg, bridging and weaving in the story to our ultimate goal: Infinity War. Black Panther is what I hoped for and while I expect nothing less of the movie, the story and characters were by far exceeded anyhow. Michael B. Jordan as the super villain known as Killmonger did a superb job and I must say, he totally redeem himself from that other Marvel movie he was in. So I deem him one of our greatest super villains in the MCU. Lupita Nyong'O as Nakia, Danai Gurira as Okoya, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, and last but not least Letitia Wright as Shuri, all did so frickin' awesome with their performances! I can see why everyone loves Shuri and it's understandable but man oh man, Chadwick Boseman outdone himself again as the Black Panther. His first appearance in Captain America: Civil War was truly great and seeing him in his own solo movie as Black Panther is without a doubt another superb performance. Can't wait to see him to continue the role in Infinity War. Hopefully we can get another sequel? Maybe even two more? Black Panther is actually one of my favorite characters in the Marvel comic book universe, so would love to see more of him. Let's not forget Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. He did more than we thought he could do in the film and he kicked ass. Glad to see he has enough spotlight as everyone else did. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue was such titular villain that seeing his performance with the character was a great treat.Black Panther is a comic book movie from Marvel Studios that you can not miss. If you're on a journey like the rest of us who watched since the very first build up from the very beginning, then you know that it's just the beginning for these beloved Marvel characters. With Infinity War coming real soon, our hype is just growing by the day.",Black Panther,2561

positive,"  Clearly, some of the disparities amongst reviews are due to the fact that many reviewers are doing so from the ""video game movie"" point of view, and that's fine.Simply as a free-standing film not related to any video game, however, I found TR to be a highly watchable, entertaining film.In reading many of the reviews here, it seems that - not entirely but by and large - most fans of the video game dislike this second movie version, while far more of those who have not played the game or simply went to see TR on its own merits as a film enjoyed it.For me, I believe this version tells a compelling, granted fantastical story, in a simple, exciting, fast-paced manner. Whereas some might say Jolie's portrayal was more overt and exciting, I felt that Vikander brought a certain subtlety and texture to the role while maintaining the physicality of the first film.Yes, on some levels it's a ""mash-up"" of certain aspects of National Treasure / Raiders / Assassins Creed, and not done as well of any of them, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a very enjoyable film.Is it faithful to the video game? That's for gamer moviegoers to decide and express, and they are right here on RT.But for the rest of us, maybe this TR and Vikander have taken a story to where a new generation of filmgoers who are unfamiliar with TR The Video Game can very, very much appreciate it. I know I did.",Tomb Raider,9895

positive,"  COCO *****The latest animation by Disney is a modern day triumph showing that in ever changing climates that they still have the power to provide the heartwarming classic tales to new generations.?Coco†follows the story of a young Mexican boy banished from following his dream of music by his family and on the celebrated Day of The Dead he triggers a curse that sends him to the world of the Dead. Yes, yes I know not quite Bambi in fact the pitch raises the question as to whether Disney was taken over by a morbidly obsessed fan of the latest Mexican hating President but evidently that is not case.¬†Coco¬†is a beautifully crafted story that has to be one of the more original animations from Disney for some time. ¬†¬†The premise fresh playing on the traditions of the Mexican nation. The film highlights their diverse culture and celebrations in a glowing light instead of the hate filled rants coming from a certain White House Resident. The film makers have almost purposely taken the film as a climate orientated opportunity to ,¬†¬†show the world that not everyone is painted with the same brush.?The story flows in the rather standard way in the first act but is truly notched up there onwards to propel expectations and style of the modern day animations much like Frozen allowed the twist to freshens it's style.?The animators are in no doubt of their audiences which accounts not only for children but the adults accompanying them with a story that in the third act ¬†has borrowed a narrative that is almost Shakespearean in it's tragedy and unites the audience with it's common humanity.¬†?Knowing full well that the prime audience is children the makers impose good morals and messages in a story that touches, amuses, entertains and surprises you with sweet tenderness.?The jokes are funny, the songs are catchy and the effects are the standard spot on animations that just seem to fail to age.?I was skeptical of how Disney would pull of a hard sell premise of a kid who spends the film hanging out with dead talking skeletons but hey it works and I can't wait to see what they do next. ¬†",Coco,5203
positive,"  Coco beautifully explains the special meaning of Dia de Los Muertos in a way that's gentle enough for kids to learn about death and that as long as we remember our loved ones, they will live in our hearts forever with the hope that we may reunite again one day. I will be seeing Coco for the 4th time today!",Coco,5797
positive,"  Coco celebrates life by diving into death. It is one of Pixar's most vibrant, melancholic adventure is a refreshing return to form.Coco is the story of a 12-year-old Mexican-American boy, Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), who finds himself in the land of the dead, after breaking a decades-old family rule about playing music. The film riffs heavily on the Mexican festival D√≠a de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), with its traditionally vibrant imagery of brightly coloured skeletons. In this flamboyant netherworld, our young hero sets out on a journey to expose a secret from his family's past. This, it is heavily hinted, will centre on the famous musician Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who just happens to be Miguel's idol.Although it has a predictable plot elements in a Pixar playbook, the script does manage one genuinely surprising twist in the third act. As the final stretch approaches, there's also the requisite tug at the heartstrings although it's delivered with such devastating delicacy that even steely viewers will find themselves moist-eyed. Coco is a rousing, affecting, fun and much-needed return to form after underwhelming Finding Nemo and Cars sequels and will help to ensure that Pixar's legacy remains intact.",Coco,5054
positive,"  Coco es la prueba de que Pixar no se esta quedando sin ideas, de que puedes hacer una pelÌcula basada en la cultura mexicana sin caer en estereotipos y presentar una historia llena de sentimientos y valores que un estadounidense no entender√° la primera vez que vea coco.En resumen: Coco es la pel√≠cula que tienes que ver para recordar tus tradiciones y ra√≠ces como mexicano.",Coco,5245

positive,  Coco is a film that returns Pixar to the days of old and what they are capable of. It is the best explanation of the Mexican Dia de Muertos celebration. Not as a macabre festival of death but a touching celebration of remembrance. The animation palette is rich and the voice acting sublime. Especially newcomer Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel.The story is a perfect family film for both kids and adults.

positive,"  Coco is a richly animated, heartwarming film that explores portrayals of the lands of the living and dead. The narrative follows Miguel, a young boy whose love of music changes his world in life and death. The strong presence of characters such as Hector, a man nearly forgotten in the Land of the Remembered, make the film relatable for all viewers. This is a film for all, young and old, and one sure not to be forgotten.",Coco,4914
positive,"  Coco is a unique movie. In which almost everything in the story connects and is interwoven with one another. The biggest thing that stood out for me in this movie are the themes and motifs used in this movie. Every little detail in the beginning of the movie comes back later in the movie as a motif, a variation, or a twist. The roles all the characters play are incredibly interesting. Form protagonist to antagonist, everyone has a purpose in the story, they all have something to learn, and they all have more layers to them then meets the eye. One thing I love is that there is not one antagonist in this movie and the role of the antagonist switch from character to character and motive to motive. Another favorite of mine in the movie is the color. This movie is colorful and beautiful. The details in the animation are incredibly detailed, both in the world and the characters.In conclusion, Coco is a masterpiece. I feel this a movie where if I see it again, I'll catch even more things I didn't pick up on on the first watch. 4.8/5 Stars",Coco,5324
positive,"  Coco is a very beautiful animation with a very emotional story based on the family and the loss of loved ones. Pixar continues to offer high quality animated films offering humor and tears, with surprising visual technology.

positive,"  Coco Is definitely a must watch, with beautiful visuals, tearjerking moments, especially for musicians. The story is compelling, and you're constantly rooting for the main characters. There is possibly only a couple flaws, 1 being that there are a couple plot holes that don't really make sense and certain points that they didn't get across well. But definitely, a must watch. Truly the best movie I think I've ever watched.",Coco,4875

positive,"  Coco is masterfully crafted. With original songs like ""Remember Me"" (Kristen Anderson-Lopez / Robert J. Lopez) featured at several different points thoughout the feature and an original score by Michael Giacchino, both paying tribute to the traditional sound of Mexico; Coco's soundtrack doesn't just accompany the story, it is the story!",Coco,4878
positive,"  Coco is one of Pixar's finest. Much like Inside Out, it'll have the adults reaching for the tissues and the kids reaching for the popcorn. It is beautifully animated, spectacularly plotted, and is Pixar's closest film yet to a musical. Pixar seem to take more tears out of me with each instalment and I am totally okay with that.",Coco,5227
positive,"  Coco is one of Pixar's greatest movies, and it had an enormous difference in quality to Pixar flops as Cars 3, The Great Dinosaur, Monsters University, Brave, and Cars 2; a quality that wasn't seem since Inside-Out. The movie clearly is out of Mexican stereotypes and it shows a great query of that country's culture; in addition to it's well-created plot and screenplay, it's stunning visuals reached by an incredible CGI animation, and a good design and developments of it's lovable characters.",Coco,5762
positive,"  Coco is one of the best Pixar movies ever.Maybe it's the fact that I'm Mexican, but this movie really brought me childhood memories in la plaza de los mariachis, the food and DÌa de los Muertos.

positive,  Coco is probably the best Disney Pixar movie I have seen to date. A story that touches the heart strings of adults and children alike. Coco carries a deep message about the importance of family values. The winning formula to this movie is that Miguel is a nobody and yet he becomes our hero. The movie sets off a new inspiring narrative for children to follow where they need to have a stronger internal locus of control and believing in making their own journey a possibility.,Coco,5759

positive,"  Coco isn't just a fantastic Pixar movie, but its a movie that's able to tell a story with dead people and make it extremely touching. Coco is a new Pixar Classic. The chemistry with Miguel and Hector is unforgettable, the music by Michael Giacchino is great, the songs are also amazing in this movie. Animation that surpasses any Pixar movie, and emotional scenes that punch you in the gut Hard! Coco is a new masterpiece, don't judge this movie by its Day of the Dead theme, the directors are telling a beautiful story with a Mexican holiday that's so touching. Pixar, you've done it again!!",Coco,4910

positive,"  Coco Montrese, in the challenge we were raised from the dead, but on the runway your Latino blood was muy caliente. You're safe.COCOSeldom does a movie inspire me and propel me to what's best in filmmaking. Coco is one of those rare films you watch that become an instant classic. And yes, the lustful visuals and the upbeat and melodic songs are a great part of the experience but what makes this movie great, is its emotional sincerity, expertly complemented by Giacchino'a score. It's clear that this movie was based around a simple premise and a love for telling stories. And when that happens, everything else is so much easier. What Coco does fantastically and what so many movies fail to do is building a connective tissue that amounts to something greater than the movie itself, as if the fibres collide to do movie magic. When we reach the climax, it feels so earned because it's simple and because it's based on sincerity. Yes, the driving force of Coco comes from the beautifully apparent simplicity in its storytelling. It's a movie that is both a stunning visual spectacle and a touching piece of art. Also, in a time when racial segregation repeats its cycle of power, it's unusually brave to have an American studio make such a radiant homage to that culture, taking the pre-emptive measures for it to be an honour, not a steal. It comes as a surprise to nobody when I say that this film will leave you emotional (granted you belong to the human race). It's uncontrollable, it's within you to be moved when you have accompanied a character and watch the climax unfold and feel like you have earned the right to cry. And normally climaxes are huge and loud but Coco keeps it simple and quiet as moments that really strike a chord often are. What's also not so common is the movie's thematic lines, as you can't help to find incredibly brave that betrayal, murder and death are topics that the movie delves in profusely (yet never tackily). In the year in which Inside Out was release, that was, hands down, my favourite movie of the year. And, damn you Pixar, it will probably be again this year. At the end of the day, you sometimes go to the movies expecting a certain familiarity, something that you can rely on. Coco feels just like coming back to a loving home, it has the sweet scent of your grandmother's cake, it's as cosy as your childhood bedroom and it reminds us of the reason we keep coming back to these movies: to feel the warmth of the purest form of cinema.",Coco,4854

positive,"  Coco was a fantastic movie for me. I loved the colors, the songs, the story behind it all, the message. It was a fantastic movie. Very well done! Unfortunately, for a kid its too long and serious. I love that Disney/ Pixar likes targeting the entire family and is always sending a great message but the movies are just too serious for kids. I have an after school program, ages 5 - 12 years old, and for our Thanksgiving Camp we took the kids to see Coco. The movie is a good chunk of time for any kid. Kids do not have the attention spam of an adult, they get bored easily and thats exactly what happened about 30 min into the movie. And this was mostly in part of the Frozen short film that was shown prior, which lasted about 25 minutes if I'm not mistaken. The short film had all the kids puzzled and aggravated they just did not know what was going on and why they were watching Olaf sing. Then Coco began and as I mentioned 30 minutes into the movie they were all ready to go and do something else. So a good hour is what kids can handle. Hopefully, other can see what I see.",Coco,5782
positive,"  Coco was a movie I didn't really know much about when I walked in to it, but I loved more than any Pixar movie before. It was heart warming, and caused me to cry at times. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, with a good message.",Coco,5684
positive,"  Coco was an amazing movie, Pixar always knows how to make amazing movies seeing as I've never hated a single one of Pixar's movies (yes that also means Cars 2). When I first heard about the movie it sounded like an interesting idea for a movie, then when the trailers came out I was crazy excited, I kept hearing people compare this movie to 2014's the Book of Life, I have never watched that movie so I wouldn't of understood it exactly apart from both movies being set in Mexico. Then when hearing the news that everyone loved the movie, I was getting even more excited... Until I discovered the movie wasn't coming to the UK until January of 2018 which made me mad! Thankfully I kept away from spoilers until the day I could watch the movie which was on the day of the movie's release in the UK which was the 19th of January of 2018.Now that I've seen Coco, I can finally say, I. Love. COCO!!!!This movie has an amazing story, amazing characters, amazing cast members who do great jobs playing the characters, amazing music, amazing songs like Remember me, Un Poco Loco, and The World Es Mi Familia, I'm not one for musicals but this movie's songs are so good. The animation from Pixar is always top notch seeing as this is Pixar we're talking about, the people who made the first computer animated movie and has had a track record of having amazing animation in their movies. The movie even has really funny jokes that feel right for the scenes that they're in, even the ones they showed in the trailers are still funny.The big question I have is that, is Coco my new favourite Pixar movie? or does that still go to Inside Out, I might have to have a re-watch of both movies for me to make my decision, I don't know.I will admit, I did cry to this movie, I was an emotional mess when seeing this movie. I highly recommend you go and see Coco while you can and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.I give Pixar's Coco a 10 out of 10, amazing movie and I can't wait to see what Pixar has in store for the future.",Coco,5241

This film plays out like The Creature from the Black Lagoon but is much more beautiful and a labour of love by the director. The film balances a horror film but also a mystery and love that is not commonly shared in this day and age. I'm shocked Del Toro has never made a film at Universal as he has the scope and ambition to remake the Wolfman or Frankenstein something unique. I hope this wins big as it deserves all the focus it is receiving by audiences and critics. 08-02-2018.",The Shape of Water,9102
positive,  del Toro is a Master Raconteur - Critics can cram it if they diss this incredible story. I want to see an extended version. The audience that watched with me was totally riveted - you could have heard a pin drop. I will pay to see it again on the big screen before I own this masterpiece. Completely recommend this film.,The Shape of Water,9323
positive,"  Del Toro is back on form with this film. Is it a monster film, a cold war film, a prisoner breakout film? It's all this and more due to del Toro ability to make his films transcend genres. Everything just fits together so well, including the added social commentary about the treatment of blacks and homosexuals.",The Shape of Water,8436
positive,"  Del Toro is one of my favorite modernn directors and this is a good example as to why.The story and concept is equally deep and,as some negative review point out, a little silly. However i find the odd elements of this to be a good reason why this and most of del toro's films stand out.He likes to tell stories about oddities in the real world. He wants to show off the wall ideas. (See pan's laberynth) and he does it in a way that captivates viewersDel Toro doesnt give a shit what people think. It just so happens he is a genius.",The Shape of Water,9343
positive,  Del Toro knocks it out of the park with this movie. Well deserving of the best picture.,The Shape of Water,8474
positive,"  Del Toro really drives the notion of: if you ever felt you were from another time and place, but having to live with the reality of this is where I am right now. The period the movie's set in matches the mood of the story - grim with a bit of hope. Shannon's instant karma is somewhat funny and tragic. I feel sorry for him...almost. Great acting by all! Beautiful set design and the amphibian man's costume is flawless.",The Shape of Water,8865
positive,  Del Toro revisits his Pans Labyrinth days and creates one of the most beautiful love stories ever told in cinematic history.,The Shape of Water,9118
positive,  Del Toro teki sen vihdoin... Nimitt√§in viiden t√§hden englanninkielisen elokuvan. Toimii kuin se kuuluisa junan vessa. Sally Hawkins on mahtava ja ansaitsee kaiken suitsutuksen. Sivurooleissa luottoporukkaa vaikka kuinka. ***** /5,The Shape of Water,9079

positive,"  Despite numerous flaws, the positives outweigh the negatives, leading to a mostly satisfying experience overall.",The Last Jedi,126
positive,"  Despite the biased criticism, I chose to see this MOVIE. This movie makes You think and feel. Then QUESTIONs why you are feeling what you feel. It propels you to take self inventory. Forcing you to unapologetically admit your flaws. Understanding, the very things that flaws your canvas, can be the catalyst used to aid your conquest in conquering your ""It."" If you can eat the meat and throw away the bones, you'll extract a valuable jewel, ""Love conquers all.""",A Wrinkle in Time,3684
positive,"  Despite the negative attention garnered through Mark Hamill's quote being manipulated out of context, I believe anyone who is a fan of the original trilogy will have to acknowledge the love of the universe the creators of this film must have had and how it shows in every moment of this installment. This is a Star Wars fan's movie through and through.",The Last Jedi,839
positive,"  Did I just see what I thought I saw? Did I feel, what I just thought I felt? I don't go to movies with my mind made up. I want the movie to take me somewhere....in time or space...it doesn't matter. just move me and like a symphony, this did. Wave after wave of brilliant film making encompassing every area of manufacturing such a work was brilliant. This movie deserves every accolade it receives.",The Shape of Water,9316
positive,  Did not expect stalin to die 5/5,The Death of Stalin,8228
positive,"  Didn't think it was going to be that good, but I was so surprisingly blown away by the entire new take on Jumanji.Karen Gillan, took me almost the entire film to finally figured out where I have seen this total hottie before. (It was only like 2 seasons of Doctor Who). But besides the good looks, she totally rocked the inner nerd's attempt at being a sexy seductress. Totally comical.Dwayne Johnson turned in good performance in the type of roles he is very good at. Not Academy Awards worthy, but entertaining.Kevin Hart (congratulations on your prediction that the Eagles will soar over the Patriots!!!) and Jack Black were awesome supporting characters in this movie. Totally worth going to see twice or more. No wonder it ranked top of the Block Office again after being out more than 2 months.",Jumanji,6643
positive,  Different concept. A definite mind bender. An original new idea and far from a remake of any other movie like itself. It was great to see a new idea and not the same old movie that gets remade every few years.,Annihilation,4625

positive,"  Disregard the TOMATOMETER, in this instance the audience score is far more telling. I've seen Tomb Raider several times now and I enjoy it more each time I see it. While it's not a perfect movie it is compelling and interesting. I think it's a shame that Rotten Tomatoes might discourage people from seeing this in theaters because it was truly a delight. If you are a fan of the games, you'll appreciate it all the better. But the beauty of this film is that you don't have to be a fan of the games to enjoy it. It stays true to the source material but doesn't forget that it's a movie and not a game, a mistake that many other adaptations have made in the past. I gave this movie 5 stars not because it was perfect but because it was enjoyable. And I think you'll enjoy it too if you get past the the TOMATOMETER and just experience it for yourself in theaters.",Tomb Raider,10178

positive,"  Dreamlike. I'll be surprised if there's a better sci-fi movie this year. Much better than the book, Garland took a great idea and made a great film. It owes a lot to Tarkovsky's 1979 film Stalker which is based on the novel Roadside Picnic. Annihilation swims in visual effects at the expense of character development. Outside of Portman's character the other roles were props. If the film failed at all it was here, where a film like Alien(s) can define a minor character in a single shot and line of dialog, Annihilation seemed to preoccupied with developing the environment as a character to notice, which ends up being its greatest strength and weakness.",Annihilation,4485

positive,  Easily Marvel's best film. Black Panther represents what can happen when you use the comic book genre for more than just a battle with a generic villain bent on destroying or ruling the world. The actors are fantastic and with a film full of characters none feel two-dimensional. The director adeptly juggles the characters so that each one feels defined in spite of the limits of time. This film is groundbreaking on so many levels and marks a milestone for Marvel. The love those who created this film had for the material shines through in every minute of the film.Wakanda forever!,Black Panther,2477

positive,"  Easily the best of the newer Star Wars movies. This one gives you something more in the best way. The Force Awakens was enjoyable as well but purely runs on nostalgic value.

As each of the female protagonists takes their own journey into the mysterious shimmer, they encounter beauty and savagery like nature itself. This is the sort of movie that will haunt you for days and leave you wondering. For me the only weak point was the end that gives answers that feel quite banal after the elusive mysterious of the preceding scenes. Highly recommended.",Annihilation,3976

positive,"  Even by Pixar standards, this film is a visual masterpiece. The soundtrack worked perfectly.

But for seventeen-year old Simon Spier it's a little more complicated: he's yet to tell his family or friends he's gay and he doesn't actually know the identity of the anonymous classmate he's fallen for online. Resolving both issues proves hilarious, terrifying and life-changing.",Love Simon,7214
positive,"  Everyone has their own opinion on what is good that's why we never listen to critics. I go to a movie to be entertained whether it be action, drama, Sci-fi. If the movie keeps me in my seat It is worthy. Alicia and the cast kept me in my seat for a fun ride. A great choice to reboot the franchise.",Tomb Raider,10029
positive,"  Everything about this movie was amazing. The visuals, the plot, the songs, everything. I can honestly say that I came into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about what it was about, and came out of the movie deciding that it was in my top 5 favorite Pixar movies...maybe even my favorite!I was always on the edge of my seat because the plot was just so interesting.

It's easy for critics of a certain age to try and minimize the film to an 80s nostalgia flick, but my 9 and 14 year olds loved every second - demanding to see it 2X in the opening weekend. It is a thrilling action film with great takes on classic and current memes, games, songs, movies and more. It also is a great morality tale. My only regret is that the two main characters weren't quite the antisocial nerds that I wanted, more more like the attractive person who puts on glasses (or a port wine birthmark) to be ""ugly""",Ready Player One,1886

Quite creative especially in its denouement, hilarious in many ways, great fun... and I can't wait opionions from the spaniards too.

However, even someone living under a rock all their life would find the film enlightening.

The world and characters are so rich and vibrant it feels like everyone and everything you see is as real and has as much history behind them as anything on our side of the silver screen. Even the villain is a robust and three-dimensional character who holds views the audience is likely to sympathize with, though he takes them to an unacceptable extreme.

positive,"  Felt the need to balance out the mixed reviews on this one. This is an amazing movie but do not go to see it if you don't want to be challenged or don't appreciate brainy or ""artsy"" sci-fi. It may look like an Alien-esque horror film but it's not. Sure there's a few jump scares but the ending is something most people won't like. It's not a movie for the masses. But what there is is brilliant cinematography, fine performances (especially by Natalie Portman) and a concept that will have you thinking for hours after seeing it. I'm not going to give away much more as Thais is a movie to be experienced and thought about on your own (maybe with some help from others afterwards).Just please don't go to see this if you are expecting a popcorn action flick.",Annihilation,4814

positive,"  Ferdinand is a masterful movie. Comparing it to the Disney short is like comparing apples and oranges. It is a powerful story about a bull who didn't want to fight, but instead smell the flowers and have friends. The ending has ferdinand showing mercy, which was the only way to survive the bullring. I would see it again and again and not get tired of it.",Ferdinand,5865

positive,"  Ferdinand is one of the most entertaining, highly excellent and laugh out movies I've ever watched in the world. The movie Ferdinand has a lot of messages behind its story and I find them ... you know, great and a worth-remembering sort of thing. This movie touched my heart the moment I watched it, and it was rare because it had never happened to me, before, and this film deserves to be remembered for a long time. Its less expected funny moments, the story original enough to put a smile on my face, the bonds of immense friendships, thrilling adventures & an unbreakable love between a loving, little girl and a tough, gentle bull who loves sniffing flowers.This film is perfect for all families of the young and the old out there, so come to Hoyts and enjoy the adventure!

positive,"  Film of the year! 2017 has given us brilliant coming of age stories like Lady Bird or horror satire like Get Out. We got scares and coming of age stories in It, now Guillermo del Toro enchants the heart with his romantic horror masterpiece The Shape of Water.Sally Hawkins is magnificent as the mute maid Eliza. You will fall in love with her and empathize with her terrible longing and heartfelt desires. Hawkins deserves the Oscar for leading actress for her performance.Doug Jones is captivating as the water creature, perceptive in his movements and facial signals. He brilliantly matches Hawkins' subtle acting. Their faces, mouths, eyes, and hand movements engage you without words.Michael Shannon delivers the villainous performance of a lifetime as the terrifying, yet thrillingly shrewd government agent. You realize he is the true monster of this fairy tale.Alexandre Desplat's score will delight your eyes with gentle and rousing classical music that perfectly fits the tone of the film. It's swells enchant with sonic magic and the subtle music cues parallel the passionate emotions on screen.Guillermo del Toro has surpassed the majesty and mystique of his previous landmark in horror film, Pan's Labyrinth, in spectacular fashion. He should be proud of crafting a movie that is simultaneously, gorgeous to gaze upon, and thrilling to witness. Go see The Shape of Water in theaters immediately!

positive,"  Finally a video game adaptation that feels like the people who made it actually played the game. While trimming the story down to fit in a movie they managed to keep most the elements of the game. I didn't like how they basically switched Roth for Lara's Dad but I understand why they did it, to add a bit of emotion to it. I understand why they added the story on the start but personally I would have liked to see this part trimmed down a bit in exchange for more time on the island.Overall I think they did a great job and can't wait for the inevitable squeal.",Tomb Raider,9640

positive,"  First and foremost, this is a movie made from a book with kids in mind. There's nothing wrong with that, and that doesn't mean adults can't enjoy the movie too. In a time where we're jam packed with movies and a world filled with explosions, war, death, and bullying, this movie is a heartfelt, comforting hug to anyone who has ever been on the recieving end of unkindess. Either from others or from our own demons. This is an excellent movie for anyone, young and old, in need of a reminder that it's our choices, not our emotions, that define who we are, and that it's never too late to be the best possible version of ourselves. Faults and all.",A Wrinkle in Time,3611
positive,  First film in a long time I've watched two times back to back...,Annihilation,4282
positive,  First I'd like to say this is NOT a remake or a reboot. It is a sequel that takes place in the same world that the original film did. The movie was great fun from start to finish. I go to the movies all the time and I've never had people in the audience laughing out loud the entire time. great action and humor. The Rock always entertains and it's worth it just to see Karen Gillan. It was a great cure for the Last Jedi blues.,Jumanji,7037

positive,"  First time I've seen the entire theater sit dead silent in their seats while the end CREDITS rolled, dumbfounded at what they just saw. Fantastic.",Annihilation,4411
positive,"  First, the great news. Hollywood made a movie about the Apostle Paul and featured a major TV star in the leading role.The production itself was first rate. The portrayal of the personalities of and relationship between Luke and Paul was intriguing and well considered. My guess is that Paul was indeed a bit of a curmudgeon, which is the way the actor chose to interpret him.The prominent role given to Priscilla and Aquila was enjoyable. These are two wonderful New Testament characters worthy of wider consideration.The reality of Paul's daily life in a dark, dank prison cell really hit home for me, as well as the reality of how his body must have been absolutely wracked with constant pain from years of abuse. Deeply moving and very humbling.I was disappointed by the extended focus on a fictional sub-plot that added nothing to the film when the Book of Acts is filled with so much fascinating material that could have been brought to life.I heard the movie was filled with flashbacks and had assumed they would flesh out some of his missionary journeys. They did not. I also would have liked to see more of Ancient Rome than two houses and a prison cell - although these three scenes certainly provide a glimpse onto the pages of the New Testament.Finally, I thought the portrayal of the 1st Century church as impotent and befuddled was inaccurate. They turned the entire Roman Empire upside down. And they certainly couldn't have done that hunkered down in a state of perpetual fear and confusion.Nevertheless, the film accomplishes much and we should rejoice in that. In just about two weeks, I will be co-leading a biblical tour ""In the Footsteps of Paul"" and we will be visiting the prison featured in the film. It promises to be a very powerful experience...and even more powerful having so recently seen the film.Let's pray for Hollywood to produce more faith-affirming films in the days to come.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7692

positive,"  For some reason, the nerd community seems very divisive about this movie. Personally, I enjoyed the book. I must have plowed through it in like three days. I think the movie version of RP1 does take a lot away from the book, but it also fixes some of the parts of the book I wasn't happy with. The challenges for the keys are different, but still very enjoyable. Chalk that up to having to use what Spielberg and Warner's had license for. I really enjoyed it and I've seen it twice already opening weekend. We constantly complain that the studios are rebooting everything and that we don't get anything new and fresh. Well, this is new, fresh, different and damn fun!",Ready Player One,1746
positive,"  For the greater part of the 21st Century, Pixar has consistently delivered some of the most original & heartfelt stories that entire families can enjoy together. ""COCO"" is one of the best films to come from the beloved animation studio, & thoroughly captures all the heart & imagination of its' best pieces, in addition to a refreshing new introduction of solely human characters. Here, the significance of an important national holiday, Dia de los Muertes, is carefully celebrated rather than exploitatively fantasized. The focus here is on the strength of the family and the beauty of remembrance, with the role of fantasy used to connect audiences to their own family legacies. Music plays an integral role, & stunning colorful imagery ties it all together. This is arguably the best film of 2017.",Coco,5331

positive,"  From 1995 to 2010 there was no doubt that Pixar was the greatest animation studio, producing huge critical and financial hits and travelling the audiences to their beautiful and imaginative worlds with their heartwarming, original and creative stories. Yes, they did make Cars back in 2006, but one film wasn't enough for the audiences to say goodbye to Pixar movies. Until that movie got a sequel. ""Cars 2"" divided audiences, leaving many widely unimpressed with its childish story. Then came ""Brave"", ""Monsters University"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"" which were all solid, but not even close to what people have come to expect from Pixar. There was still ""Inside Out"", which was a return to from and ""Finding Dory"" which was a very entertaining and succesful sequel to one of Pixar's biggest hits, 2003's ""Finding Nemo"". Earlier this year, Pixar released ""Cars 3"" which people just weren't interested in. It was better than ""Cars 2"" but still a far cry from the studio's best work. And while many thought ""Coco"" was just going to be a carbon copy of another film set in Mexico during the Day of the Dead, ""Book of Life"", the movie has actually turned out ot be one of the studio's most original, creative and breathtaking efforts yet.",Coco,5758

positive,"  From toys to monsters to robots to the voices inside our heads, Pixar has done it all. But with Coco, Pixar gives us a taste of the Mexican culture and the Land of the Dead.

positive,"  garland is one of the most interesting filmmakers in the market at the moment and this film is another successful venture for him, but it is not the book by any means. I loved the book and while this film has the soul of the overall arc, it never hits the same beats which might disappoint hardcode fans of the book. the film is a cerebral mind bending experience that will leave you scratching your head, much like the book and I think this will alienate the audience. I am calling this as a film that will be on top 10 lists within the next 20 years, this is Kubrick colours and visual art at the tallest order, a modern cult film that will linger with filmgoers. I mentioned the book earlier and I'm slightly annoyed that this robbed the audience of seeing that book adaption. this changes everything and as a huge fan of the book it annoys me that they only keep the name and distance themselves from the book which begs the question of buying the rights to the book. this reminds me of Kubrick and king tension after the shining opened, if I was vandermeer I would be slightly annoyed that this film failed to capture the true story of the book, the next books continue the mystery and they will never see the light of day on film due to this film changing so much. 20-03-2018.",Annihilation,4039

Some people will just never be happy. I enjoy the flow of learning about new abilities not explored via the movies. I enjoy the fact that there are force user in Kylo and Snoke that are not Sith, but use the emotion and hate to wield the force. I also like that Rey appears to be heading down a path that might be seen as a Grey Jedi, where emotion and a sense of right intertwine to a point that there is a balance of the force within her. She has feeling and emotions that she allows to shape her decisions, but also has the central idea of the Jedi path to be of service and assistance to those in need.All in all a good movie that I'll enjoy watching over and over again.",The Last Jedi,744

positive,"  Greatly enjoyed.Hollywood has been working for years to try and turn successful video games into successful movies. While they have been met with limited success, these studios have yet to really make a movie that has won over audiences on a broad scale. The most recent effort, Tomb Raider, was not the first great video game movie that so many of us have been waiting for, but it was the closest that we have come so far, and it was clearly a step in the right direction. It certainly qualifies as the best movie based on a game so far. Tomb Raider wasn't perfect, but it was good. That by itself puts the movie above nearly all its competition. There are several things that Tomb Raider did right in making the transition from the video game to the theatrical release. Here are a few of them. If there's one thing that most of the reviews have agreed on, even those that didn't love the film, it's that whatever faults Tomb Raider has, Alicia Vikander is not one of them. The actress puts forth a strong performance as the new Lara Croft and is able to make her a believable action hero while also making her a relatable character.",Tomb Raider,9710
positive,"  Greeeeat Movie! A must see! It is funny, touching, inspirational. Probably one of my favorite Pixar movies.",Coco,5067
positive,  Grew up with the books and it is a great fun film for kids.,Peter Rabbit,7933

positive,"  GROWING UP IN THE 80'S I was fortunate enough to see the films of a fantastic writer director of teen movies, his name was john hughes. This movie felt to me like a modern john hughes teen movie. The one twist that john never had a chance to do is make a gay teen the main character. the movement from scene to scene and the character's have depth yet not enough not to OVERRIDE simon leaving the watcher to feel simons angst that much more. As far as the writing it was excellent and can appeal to older generations who struggled the same as simon, maybe the method of coming out has changed but the emotion has not, love,simon spreads that STRUGGLE through the generations. Though the ending could have been more romantic it was awkward like first love always is. if you're a parent wanting to understand what your child is or has gone through this is a great movie to process what it is like for them.",Love Simon,7319
positive,"  Guillermo at his dark romantic best, shape of water is so much more than what you think. Like most toro films, the darkness of the characters and bleak story makes you feel like a horror film almost at first, but what seems so dark turns so romantic. Strong acting work from Shannon (extremely dark character) and a game stopping turn from Sally Hawkins, shape of water will leave you breahless",The Shape of Water,8873
positive,"  Guillermo Del Toro has captured the sensation of loneliness. Sally Hawkins dazzles with a rare grace and Doug Jones radiates as always. Together, mixed with the outstanding score from Alexander Desplat, they wordlessly and beautifully guide us from scene to scene.",The Shape of Water,8968
positive,"  Guillermo Del Toro has made his richest film yet with an absorbing story, visually masterful, a stellar performance from Sallie Hawkins, and an equally emotional experience. A+",The Shape of Water,9174
positive,"  Guillermo del Toro is back!!! and not to mention has crafted out another if not the.. most accomplished and outstanding effort of his career, this film may as well deserve to be called his 'Magnum Opus'. In saying that, the film itself is a mix of a surrealistic fantasy underlined by it's cold war America setting and political context, while at the same time it's an unlikely and uncanny romance that works so well, I can't help but think ""it's like nothing I've ever seen before"", unparalleled and unprecedented in any shape or form (unintended pun XD). While the story is almost a lot more character driven than plot from Sally Hawkins' outstanding performance (high hopes to win gold), del Toro never loses focus on any of the film's characters whose conflict's as well as their developments are just as compelling as the overarching plotting of the film. Even as outstanding as the film is to experience from it's story and characters, it's visual palette is every bit as outstanding as del Toro's direction dictates and the flawless editing and flow of the film's construction alone. Not one moment was I bored throughout the entire run-time of this film, I can't recommend it highly enough for what it's worth and that is; 'every minute of your time and every cent of your money you may pay to see this film, it's an instant classic for the ages and not just for Guillermo del Toro alone.",The Shape of Water,9166

positive,"  Guillermo del Toro logra darle forma de una manera magnÌfica a una historia que marc√≥ el cine, eligiendo con sublime excelencia cada uno de los detalles y argumento. Sin duda todo un poema y tributo.",The Shape of Water,9082
positive,"  Guillermo Del Toro made Pan's Labyrinth, which in my humble opinion is one of the greatest films ever made. This isn't tehre, but it's very good. An achingly beautiful story about alienation, love and loneliness. It's cinematically gorgeous, as you would expect from Del Toro, and the acting is splendid throughout.",The Shape of Water,9024
positive,  Guillermo Del Toro made what many consider the film of the decade. At least I've heard. And agree.,The Shape of Water,9356
positive,"  Guillermo Del Toro once again brings his love for monster horror and makes it naturally sweet. What this film does is develop certain characters scene by scene, in no small part by the performances by Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, and especially Doug Jones as the one creature. And the heavy-handed Cold War ideas that were prevalent make it all the more fitting for the chance to sympathize - and fall in love - with what is essentially a B-movie monster.",The Shape of Water,8992
positive,"  Guillermo del Toro's career to date has produced fantasy movies with a dark, oddball quality that makes him a unique figure at the moment. The Shape of Water continues this style and is recognisably his movie but is, I think at least, the sweetest and most heartwarming of his works to date. Yes, there are still some grim scenes that made me squirm uncomfortably in my seat but the overall feel I left with was of a magical and tender story and a perfectly crafted piece of cinema. Sally Hawkins has a smile that could melt the iciest heart and is simply charming as the dumb cleaning lady Eliza, who falls in love with an amphibious creature that is being studied in a military laboratory. The story is populated by a number of characters who are ostracised by the 1960s American society in which the story unfolds. A particular delight is Octavia Spencer as Zelda, Eliza's co-worker who often acts as her interpreter. This is a touching and heartwarming allegory which is very deserving of all the praise and awards it has gathered over the past few months since it was released. I am sure this will become a firm favourite for years to come.",The Shape of Water,8512
positive,"  Guillermo del Toro's crowning achievement. A lush, thoughtful tribute to the films of yesterday.",The Shape of Water,9224

A film, what I was waiting for. It shows the divine and the human in an excellent mixture. One of my favourite scene when Luke, the physician save the Roman's daughter's life with his medical knowledge (instead of healing her in miraculous way, which wa common that time). Brave art movie, showing those christian saints like humans and at the same time help to understand better the unimaginable Divine Mercy. Prepare space in your heart if you plan to watch! And I was just wondering, those critics, whom did't find enough action in the movie: what would they do with.. hmm for example northern europian art movies, or even Stalker ;)",Paul Apostle of Christ,7709

positive,"  Honestly, I expected a cameo filled movie like this to be, well, nothing but cameos. I expected a weak plot, and weak characters, but was instead thrown down a very exciting and existential rabbit hole. The movie handles the source material very well, and the cgi is absolutely incredible. the movie is a beautiful tribute to new and old pop culture, and is a movie about video games that does the medium justice.",Ready Player One,1332
positive,"  Honestly, I was a little hesitant going into this, as a lot of Christian films tend to be cheesy, poorly-made, Scripturally and theologically flimsy/borderline heretical, etc. I could go on. However, the subject matter (Saint Paul) and the casting intrigued me enough to give it a shot. And I'm so happy I did.It's one of the best Christian films I have ever seen, and that's including the old Hollywood Biblical epics.This film gives a fair representation of the harsh reality of the lives of the early Christians. It's dramatic, but not overly so. It's blunt, yet gentle. It treats its characters with respect and heartfelt humanity. Most importantly, however, is the highest regard it shows to its inspiration, the Gospel message of Christ-the joyful hope and perseverance it gives, the transformative power it brings to hearts and lives, the truth and peace it gives in a chaotic world.The movie is called 'Paul, Apostle of Christ', and yet, the film isn't really ABOUT Paul. Which is why it's wonderful. Despite his great accomplishments, everything Paul did was not to bring glory or recognition to himself, but to Jesus. Despite being the greatest evangelist the Church will ever know, Paul considered himself unworthy of any boasting, except to boast in what Christ had done for him and the rest of the world.Saul/Paul had caused so much pain and suffering to the early followers of Jesus, and then he himself would come to know that same pain and suffering himself for Christ's sake. He knew death was not a loss or an end, but true life and gain.This movie is faithful to that message of God's great love. Go see it. A 43% critics score is absurdly hyper-critical, though, unsurprising.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7660

positive,"  Honestly, it scared the crap out of me. It was weird enough and had that intangible ""something"" that had me still thinking about it days later. It's weird because it is a true sci fi and it is about what would happen if a complete (tiny spoiler - don't read the next five words if you don't want a hint................ alien ""something"" fooled with our DNA,............ because that is what the unknown something probably does naturally. It doesn't tell too much about the unknown something, which might make people frustrated, but honestly it doesn't take away from the film because it's supposed to leave you wondering and thinking and putting it together, and it does, not just about what happened, but about what the unknown something is, what might happen next, why, and a lot more. It gives enough info that I wouldn't ever want to encounter this situation, ever. I'd rather encounter a monster from a monster movie, because you might be able to get away from it. But it was the overall idea and the visuals that somehow made me feel really creeped out (in a good way for a scary sci fi). If a movie leaves me still thinking about it for days, it's a good movie. It's unique, it's thought provoking, and it makes you want to know more. I think it explores the topic of what gives a person their true identity, what happens if that gets tampered with, and at what point does someone stop being who they are. That's what creeped me out. It explores stuff that we don't completely understand ourselves, and made me think about things that are almost out of my comprehension. like how complicated a person's body and mind are, what makes me me, and would I still be me if someone shifted stuff around so I'm not the same me or a version of me. Or if someone clones me, would that be me . I can't explain it. I can just say there's a reason it's creepy and it's hard to explain, but it explores something very thought provoking and frightening. It's a shame that they released it on Netflix first. I couldn't believe I'd seen it on Netflix and then realized it was just coming up in the theater. That's pretty jerky for the studio to do to the producer. I'd go see it in the theater, too, just because I think the producer got a raw deal, but I'm still feeling the creeps from it, and not sure I want to have nightmares tonight. If it doesn't scare you, then you don't understand it. The force or ability of the unknown something, though subtle at first, is more destructive than an atom bomb, and sneaks up on you like a really sly predator that gets you to walk right up to it. The only thing I didn't think was deep was the people's characters, but I don't think that is the goal of this type of movie. The movie is making you wonder who people are (in a general sense) anyway, on purpose, so I think character development maybe wouldn't improve the goal. Maybe I'm wrong. It's just my first thought about it. Overall, I would not forget this movie. It left a strong impression on me. It almost seems to me to be a cross between a sci fi, a horror movie and a something just totally unreal, surreal, bizarre, but still mostly a sci fi because it COULD be possible, if there was an unknown entity with this much power, capable of this type of scientific meddling.",Annihilation,4190

Ex Machina , by the same film maker, also gave me a real creepy scare. It was also a sci fi, addressing deep subjects with what could be and what would that mean, and what does it mean to be human. I'm not surprised both films were by the same director. He really has a certain flair going on in his films, and I think they are both very well done and very unique and thought provoking for those who are willing to think, and they both scared me more than a monster movie would have.",Annihilation,4261
positive,"  Honestly, probably the best movie I've seen in a while. It was a thrilling, hilarious adventure that made 2 hours seem like 30 min. I wanted more. The best part was the references to about 90% of my fandoms. I will own this movie when it comes out, and I will watch it more than once. Well done, Spielberg. Well done.",Ready Player One,969

positive,  I (a grown man who isn't accustomed to crying) was in tears at the happy ending. This is an extremely moving movie. Now officially one of my favorite movies. It was sad to see so few in the theater. But it was a 5:20 showing on a Tuesday. I hope this movie makes plenty; so that more of this quality will follow!

positive,"  I absolutely loved this movie! I can see why it has a high rating on here! There was so much to it that I personally learned, a lot that I related with. Perhaps people found it boring if they were not familiar with Mexican culture, but it is truly accurate of what the culture represents. I could watch it again, and definitely recommend it.",Coco,5229
positive,"  I absolutely loved this movie. The soundtrack as well as the visuals were, as expected from Del Toro, beautiful. I went into the movie not knowing it was one of his movies, but later I was not suprised in the least. Stylistically it was very similar to Pan's Labyrinth. Those two movies, even if very different story wise, conveyed a similar kind of feeling. If you liked one of them, I'm certain you'll like the other as well. I can understand that some might found it a tad too long but I didn't feel that a single scene wasn't necessary for the story as a whole. Which is why for me it's one of the best movies that came out in 2017.",The Shape of Water,8441
positive,"  I absolutely loved this, packed as it is with dozens and dozens of off-handed references to pop culture trivia. It is pretty true to the book, though I did not get the same warm fuzzy feelings from the book. Would highly recommend the read, and the watch!",Ready Player One,1237
positive,  I actually really enjoyed this movie. I like this new take (follows the rebooted video game). For a movie based on a video game this is Excellent. My wife really liked the movie as well,Tomb Raider,9755
positive,"  I admit, I went into this movie expecting this disappointment of Pete's Dragon, especially after seeing a few reviews giving it a less than stellar number of stars. However, upon leaving the theater, I felt the same lightness and joy I experienced watching Wonder. The film had a deep heart, displaying the power of love and the worth of humans-- and that we can deserve love for being ourselves, rather than constantly striving for approval.A Wrinkle in Time featured charming actors, with Storm Reid stealing the scenes as the persnickety, precocious Meg Murry. Deric McCabe is perfectly cast as the impercetable and brilliant Charles Wallace, while Levi Miller's kind Calvin consistently offers the support Meg needs to save the day. The Mrs.'s, played by Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon, are dazzling, beautiful, wise, brave, and unknowable as they guide the children on first a search and then a rescue mission, giving the children the courage and tools to fight the darkness. I read this book in 5th grade and despised the slow classroom pace and the drying of the novel's appeal with homework and questions. As an English teacher, I revisited the book this past Christmas and quickly devoured others in the series, captivated by the flawed, clever fighter who is Meg Murry. I found permission to be a smart, capable woman as well as permission to live with flaws and not constantly try to cover them up in shame. I found a deeper appreciation for the people around me and a desire to reach out and make the world a better place. While a two hour movie does not allow for the depth of development we find in books, this film adaption does good job of opening many of those doors for viewers. Ryan Coogler's praise for director Ava DuVernay is well earned with a fantastic, diverse cast, beautiful scenery, and spot on emotional appeals. This film will inspire people to love themselves and spread joy, it will inspire viewers to find a solution other than violence, inspire girls to be scientists and dreamers, and inspire us all to look for the wonder just beyond our view.",A Wrinkle in Time,3602
positive,"  I always laugh at the critics. They so predictably hate Christian movies.We LOVED this movie. It's well written, well acted, and it's challenging as a Christian. If you're not a believer I still really recohmmend it because it shows our himan side and how just because were Christian's doesn't mean we don't have questions or that we don't struggle to act like Jesus when things get hard.It's a great movie.",Gods not Dead,6103

positive,  I am a huge fan of the 2013 Tomb Raider game and its sequel. So I was really looking forward to this incarnation of Lara Croft on the big screen. This movie did not disappoint. Don't go see it expecting Oscar caliber acting and writing! Go see for the love of the serial action genre and just fun action. I can't wait to see what else they do with this film in the future!,Tomb Raider,10214
positive,"  I am absolutely in love with this movie and although it has a few flaws, as a fan of the video game and know what the intention was story-wise (to take things from both rebooted games and some easter eggs and influences from older games and even movies), this was very well done and for me the video game curse has been broken thoroughly :)",Tomb Raider,10286
positive,"  I am blown away. I hoped it would be half way decent, but let's be real, video game adaptations don't have the best track record. But Tomb Raider exceeded my expectations! It was REALLY good! This is a solid action adventure film in the vein of Indiana Jones meets National Treasure meets the Hunger Games. It's a fun time. You don't have to know anything about the character in order to enjoy it... but if you DO love the game series, you are in for a real treat. THIS is how you do VG adaptations.The acting is top notch and a big reason this film succeeds. Combine that with a fast pace, good world building, solid supporting characters, and the bravery to NOT jump the shark with the story... and you have a winning combo on your hands. Go see it! You will not be disappointed!",Tomb Raider,10062

positive,"  I am going to talk about this film. I went to see the film in the cinema 1 month ago. I really like it.It's about 4 people who played a video game called Jumanji. They went into the video game and played it. The game is about life or death. They have many crazy adventures and they were very scared.I love it because the people are very funny and fun. They've got superpowers, for example: one of the people can run very quickly. They've got 3 lives and when they lose it they die. Everyone got weak points.Please see it! It's fantastic!",Jumanji,6226
positive,"  I am not 100% certain as to why this is getting such good reviews with critics, and such terrible reviews with audience. Is it possible that so many audience members truly had no idea what they were going to see? This is quintessential Star Wars, and the newer generation is wrecking the acting of the original one. Mark Hamill's acting in this, is the WORST part of the movie. No one is giving Adam Driver enough credit, and YES the ""last jedi"" is going to be a god damned woman! Why is everyone having such a hard time with this? Rey is 10x the jedi that Luke was anyway. I don't get it. I really feel as though everyone forgot that this is the 8th film in a franchise. Did you see 1-3? Go complain over there.",The Last Jedi,82
positive,"  I am obsessed with this movie, the amount of times I cried because of the jokes or cried because of the situations the characters were in is amazing. The characters feel very real and i was immediately attached to them, Some of the dialogue from the kids is a little cringe (they said outdated slang like HJ and stuff but that's just a nitpick), but for the most part they act pretty realistic. There were parts where I was feeling extremely anxious Because Simon was put in a situation that I (and many other LGBT+ people) are very framiliar with. I know how it felt to be in that exact situation. As a gay man this hit very close to home and I'm sure other many LGBTQ+ people will be able to heavily relate to Simon's journey. This movie will forever be one of my favorites, I can feel it!",Love Simon,7572
positive,"  I am really happy that the main character was someone with a disability. I really liked how it was set in the 50's. and that it showed some of the fashion and so some of the cars of the decade. I thought it was very insightful to show that some of the ""relationships that were thought of as ""Normal"" relationships were far from perfect.",The Shape of Water,8693
positive,  I am still smiling ????????,Ferdinand,6036
positive,"  I am struggling to understand the horrible reviews. I certainly get someone just not liking the movie, but hating it? I actually loved it. I had to step away from the book and take the movie on its own merits. I thought the cinematography was gorgeous and the message beautiful. I'm not sure why we can't just embrace a message of hope and love. We kinda need that these days. The message I took was that the ""It"" - darkness- whispers words of fear and hurt and anger in our ears, and feeds on them. And that we each must overcome our own process of mind to help build light in the larger world. Even as Meg stood facing her brother in the ""darkest of all minds""...you could see the neurons firing, telling her all the worst she had ever thought of herself. She had to listen to the voices of light to overcome those thoughts, and by doing so she could help Charles Wallace win as well. Beautiful, I think. Watching love and courage of self win is not such a bad way to spend a couple hours.",A Wrinkle in Time,2996
positive,"  I am thrilled and excited about this film for a variety reasons. As a woman, a mother, a person of color and child of the 80's who loves comics and super heroes, it means so very much. For me, it goes beyond the entertainment, the action and the fandom. It's the representation on the big screen that makes it so thrilling. When I was young, being a dark skinned black girl was treated like a crime. I was picked on, laughed at and called names because of my skin tone. But now, the amazing dark-skinned women in this film are revered, respected and seen as beautiful, awesome, kick-ass heroines. Coming full circle does not even begin to describe it. I can't wait to see it.",Black Panther,2869
positive,"  I apologize if I'm saying too much-I normally can't stand this piss stain on the slacks of the internet website or the virtue signaling mockery it has made of movie critique. But I'm going to try my hardest nonetheless while I'm still overwhelmed with the film I just saw. I'm going to try to explain why I'm still crying after an hour after leaving the theater. The Shape of Water is perhaps one of the most perfect films ever made, at least to me. The kind in which you have a *need* to see even the credits to completion, and your feet don't work until you do. There was never a moment that felt out of place in this film--the performance by each and every actor in this film was perfection crafted by one of the most beautiful minds to have ever sat in a director's chair. I loved Elisa within two minutes of her initial presence on the screen--every moment in her daily routine revealing something about her character that words simply couldn't express. Even the scene where the actress appears completely naked serves a purpose: Elisa possesses a beauty that most people don't readily see. Her appearance is that of a reserved and timid young woman, but this scene shows us that she has features not unlike the most delicate of flowers. And later when she begins to form ties with her ""Romeo"", we see that this flower has an extremely strong stem. The performance between Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones makes you completely forget that you're seeing a mute woman have sex with a water monster-what you'll see instead is a relationship stripped away of misleading nature of words, and instead built by the subtle power of touch. I'm not sure what to say other than to congratulate every actor that brought this film to life and the crew that built it's world. Mr. del Toro, The Shape of Water is one of the greatest films I ever had the good fortune to see. Thank you for sharing it with me.",The Shape of Water,9121
positive,"  I approached this with caution, video game movies being what they are etc. However, this is a stand out, Vikander is excellent and the nods the the game are good and don't break your immersion. My favourite video game movie by a long shot. My only complaint would be some annoying music near the start, it's the type you either love or hate and that not great for the first chase/action sequence.",Tomb Raider,9852
positive,  I believe now that the fish man saves her. Not the other way around. She was an evolved fish. The meeting was not really random because the fish man was a god. Great film,The Shape of Water,8940
positive,  I bought Star Wars The Last Jedi was a great movie especially the lackluster performance of the force awakens which one could argue was a rehash of A New Hope with a little bit of Empire Strikes Back thrown in. The Last Jedi while not perfect is a much better movie than people are giving it credit for. I highly suggest going and checking it out.,The Last Jedi,746
positive,"  I can see how people who have never played ""Tomb Raider Definitive Edition"" or ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" would give this film a poor rating. For me, as an avid fan of both games, I appreciate how they recreated so much of the games sequences, but also how they made a very enjoyable film version that is appealing for a broader audience. Alicia makes for an amazing Lara, she's strong and capable, but also vulnerable and you feel excited to be part of her journey. People who are comparing the movie to the game and expecting the first to be an exact copy of the later are just crazy.",Tomb Raider,10301
positive,"  I can't believe all the negative reviews! This is a disney movie based on a young adult novel. If you've read the book, this is fun to see. They left out some scenes I would have loved to see included in the film, but that's how any book adaptation goes.

positive,"  I created an account to rate this movie and Im 32. I hadn't read the book, and I'm sure the only true issue I have with the movie would be somewhat resolved in a novel. The only issue I held with the movie was the villain of the movie (IOI headed by a pretty typical protagonist). Other than that, the movie had me very engaged, and thoroughly entertained from start to finish. Given some time, I could probably come up with other plot holes and issues, like Ogg not already knowing how many references there were to his late wife in the archives, the villain giving away his plan to blow up Wade's house. Not to mention he hires a dude to do a job and blatantly tries to ruin his Bounty Hunter's plan. Either way, this movie gets a 5/5* stars from me and that's because the ending was absolutely perfect, and It truly gave a new feeling to what felt like a ride through a new world's Willy Wonka, with just as good of an ending with a message that should reach a digital audience on a personal level. *would give it 4/5, but I feel it deserves more than a simple 80% for an audience score.

positive,"  I didn't expect much when I watched this movie and there were a lot of twist and turns. It's another fast paced animated film but everything were somehow precise to the point. The story is heavily focused on the importance of family and believing on whatever you want to be. Miguel is one of those kids who still believe in that. It was an enjoyable movie, never the less. The near end of the story was heartbreaking but that's when you realized that family is very important. It's pretty much the message this movie is showing to us. Hopefully this movie is included in the upcoming video game, Kingdom Hearts 3. It seems to be an appropriate setting for the game and i wouldn't be surprised if Sora and Miguel become instant best friends since they are much alike.",Coco,4944

positive,  I dont care what the critics say. There not directing the movies to white christians and all the other bull. Its like they all missed the moral of the story which is that belielf in god is your choice and no one should have a say in your belief. No matter your Race! The Movies point out that god (any god you belive in cause even people who aren't Christian or Catholic can relate to the hate and hurt shown in this movie) will give you a life full of challenges but u hold to strength belief and hope you can overcome anything but if its your tine to go then go in peace with whatever you hold dear. Change the word god to any other belief and these critics will have the same ideal. But if you change the word god to what you believe in and what the christian god has done for his followers to what your belief does for your followers then is the movie not sending the same message.

Jordan put so much heart and HURT into his character, that it's hard not to want to take the hurt away. Not that his plan is good, you obviously can't agree with it, but you can understand why he's so angry. Shuri delivered some funny lines, but if you aren't familiar with some of the teen slang and a Willow Smith song, it may not be obvious. The CGI sucked, but that's so frequently the case with Marvel that it's almost a requirement. I loved the way women were presented as strong, and willing to fight and die for their country above all else. No movie is perfect, neither is this one, but it's really REALLY great!!",Black Panther,2304
positive,"  I don't think I'm a completely unsophisticated filmgoer - fmy favourite film in the last couple of years is ""The Lure"", from Poland - does that help place me? But I loved this movie! I think DuVernay's directorial choices are daring, and I don't like all of them, but I was utterly charmed by most. This is a child's story, told to and for children. If you go, let your inner child watch it. I haven't read the book, but I went with my daughter (BA in Comparative Literature, Masters in Libarary Science) who read it when she was 11 or 12, and she helped keep my expectations for the story itself realistic (youngsters who read it are powerfully affected but often surprised by its flaws if they re-read it later in life). We were both delighted.",A Wrinkle in Time,3386
positive,  I don't think I've watched a movie that's nearly as emotional as Coco. The plot is so well thought out and its portrayal of the afterlife is convincing.,Coco,4868

positive,  I don't understand all the haters! This movie was awesome. Strong female lead beautiful diversity. Uplifting! Inspiring! Stunning costumes and cinematography. A classic story of love conquers evil.,A Wrinkle in Time,3238
positive,  i dunno i actually really liked it because it was cute. sometimes you dont really need to analyze things in order to enjoy them.,Peter Rabbit,7991
positive,"  I enjoyed every minute of this movie. It is not a perfect match to the book, and I didn't expect it to be. The director made each change deliberately and the love and thoughfulness put into this movie shows at every turn. The visuals and art direction were stunning and unique, something I always appreciate when I go to see a movie. But bottom line, my kids loved this movie and got to see a preteen girl be the hero using her wits and her faults to save the day even when the adults failed. fantastic.",A Wrinkle in Time,3496
positive,"  I enjoyed the film a lot! Filled with fun, edge-of-your-seat action scenes, an interesting and fresh take on Lara. Alicia killed it, she's always a delight to watch on screen and have this magnetism about her, you can't take your eyes of her!",Tomb Raider,10135
positive,"  i ENJOYED THE MOVIE THAN BLACK PANTHER. PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM A FAN OF THE BOOK AND AUTHOR, AND AM NOT A FAN OF THE mARVEL STORYLINES AND FILMS. MY GUESS IS THAT THOSE WHO CRITICISED THE MOVIE HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK OR COULD APPRECIATE THE PLOT. INSTEAD, THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM WERE EXPECTING AN ACTION-PACKED THRILLER, BUT INSTEAD, FOUND THEMSELVES WATCHING A TOUCHING STORY ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL FINALLY ACCEPTING HER IMAGE.",A Wrinkle in Time,3690
positive,"  I enjoyed the movie very much, you will diffidently get the best enjoyment from the movie if you have read the book, and understand the pop culture references",Ready Player One,1824
positive,  I enjoyed the movie. Really made me think about what life was like for the Christians back then. Very moving and outstanding portrayal of Paul & Luke.,Paul Apostle of Christ,7724
positive,"  I enjoyed this film a great deal, a fun and intense adventure film that channels Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade better than any adventure film has since its release. The fact that critics were mixed shows how far why've fallen down the rabbit holes of their own self-importance. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed.",Tomb Raider,10083
positive,"  i enjoyed this movie very much. like most science fiction movies today, i wish the plot would reveal more answers but other than that the movie possessed good plot development and mystery. wish they would come out with more movies like this,",Annihilation,4412
positive,  I enjoyed this thrill ride from start to finish.,Tomb Raider,9940
positive,"  I enjoyed too much this movie. I loved Sally Hawkins and Michael Shannon interpretations. Sadly they didn't won an Academy Award. I liked the Plot Twist at the end. I loved the soundtracks of the movie, it's fits perfectly in the movie. And the labs based on the year.",The Shape of Water,8451
positive,"  I felt as though this was a heartwarming story that helps to normalize the lives and emotions of gay people. I found my story connected to Simon's and found many of the things I have gone through in my life reflected in his trials but ultimately he shows that hes just like everyone else, except he is attracted to men. The plot itself used many tropes of romantic comedies and coming of age stories so it wasnt original, but it was normalizing and i find that refreshing.",Love Simon,7270
positive,  I felt more loved watching this movie than I have in a very long time.,Love Simon,7426
positive,  I felt that it would have be hard to make a movie from a child very pleased with the end results. The animat lthevion was great and it the other characters were great. was easy to cheer for Ferdinand. I would recommend it.,Ferdinand,5855

positive,  I got very into this movie. It was way more emotional than I expected. Bring a tissue. Fantastic movie.,Coco,5316
positive,  I grew up on games. Video games shaped my childhood. This movie? Brings back all the old and all the new with everything from old arcade games to Overwatch. The reality in this movie is every baker's wet dream. Perfectly tied with nerdiness and nostalgia and the rush of adventure in exploring a new game... best movie I've seen in years.,Ready Player One,1600
positive,  I had high expectations and was still blown out of the water. Cannot recommend this movie enough.,Black Panther,2699

positive,"  I had to see it twice. The first time I gave it a solid 7.5. But the second time i saw it I gave it a 9.5. The issues I had the first time were gone. I loved every second of it. The story was amazing, the action, and I cant wait for whats next.",The Last Jedi,638

positive,"  I have a new Pixar favorite. Well done, Disney!",Coco,5002
positive,"  I have been a huge Tomb Raider fan since I was very young. I remember my dad buying the games for me and taking me to see the movies with Angelina Jolie as Lara. I loved those movies, and thought they could never be top them. This movie is a great representation of the new Tomb Raider games. I think the moive was entertaining to watch but this might be just because I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan. But the movie was beautiful and I felt that the acting was on par with great actors such as Alicia Vikander playing as Lara Croft. I will admit there are flaws in the movie, some of which that will need to be improve if there is to be a sequel but overall I was impressed with what they did with this movie adaptation of my beloved favorite video game.",Tomb Raider,9724
positive,"  I have been two times at Dia de Muertos and i can say that Coco efectively captures the true feeling of this celebration, but most of all it really grasps the beautiful relationships of family in latin america. I cried my heart out not because i was sad, but because i was filled with joy and amazement.",Coco,5737

positive,  I have heard great reviews for this film and i have high hopes for it. LET'S SAVE THE OASIS!,Ready Player One,1159
positive,  I have seen this movie twice. Once at a free screening and once just yesterday. This is a great movie! Have there been other better coming of age coming out movies? Of course but the very fact that this movie is playing nationwide really puts a great spotlight on our culture. There are a lot of lessons to learn in this movie for all kinds of people. I think that the most important one is that who you are attracted to is only one facet of your life. He did everything that every other teenage boy did and the only difference is that he happens to be gay. I think that this movie will help a lot of young people who are having a hard time coming to terms with their sexuality. To top it off. It's a very warmhearted and funny movie! I am really looking forward to owning it on bluray down the road as it is sure to be a cult classic!,Love Simon,7469
positive,"  I have some reviews and my point of view is what reviews are considering to be ""faults"" I believe are the strength of the movie. I believe this to be one of those novels that is extremely hard to adapt into a movie, but I think they took the essence of the book a produced a wonderful movie. So Wrinkle in Time I gift you your faults.",A Wrinkle in Time,3347
positive,"  I haven't laughed so much in a long time, especially Jack Black was amazing as a girly teenager and helped to remember that deep inside the adventurer were other characters.It also showed off the type off video games nowadays are popular.",Jumanji,6403
positive,"  I haven't played the games and I didn't see it with Angelina Jolie because it had Angelina Jolie in it, but the trailer looked fun so I went. I was pleasantly surprised. I was reminded of the excitement of Indiana Jones. I hope they make a sequel, but not try and follow the game.",Tomb Raider,9983

positive,"  I honestly loved the hell out of this movie. There's really nothing I wish I could change, just add. As again, books will always have more than the movie counterpart, but it was astonishing seeing it play on the big screen.",Ready Player One,1857
positive,"  I honestly think the main reason people are giving this film flak, is that Laura Croft doesn't have giant breasts and her body isn't a main focus of filming. Tomb Raider stands on its own story. To be fair, it isn't the g.o.a.t, but it is an engaging and entertaining film. It is certainly a fun film worth watching.",Tomb Raider,9453
positive,"  I just got done seeing this movie I am frankly baffled by the bad reviews this movie is getting. I such a fun time viewing this film. The graphics are great. The action is executed exceptionally. Alicia Vikander really steals show. Her acting is above and beyond what would be considered adequate. Honestly, I don't know why I'm not seeing for articles talking about another great female role model being introduced. This Lara Croft is absolutely a better role model for girls than Wonder Woman. Best video game-based movie ever. Awesome",Tomb Raider,9943

positive,"  I just saw this in theaters wirh some friends. This movie noy only has amazing scene-shots but an amazing cast. The people who're in production and acting for this film are totally heartfelt. You can tell they put their hearts into making this real. I cried during nearly the entire movie. Every scene had something beautiful in it.A part that hit me hard was the scene with Simon's mom telling him that he deserves everything good. She still loved Simon even after he was out. It hit me hard because it's something personal. I wish my own mom would've had that reaction. Instead I got the butt-end of that ""accepting parent"" stick.I hope all of you out there, out or not, are happy. I hope you enjoy your lives to the fullest, YOUR fullest.",Love Simon,7299
positive,"  I just watched Paul, Apostle of Christ.It was an excellent movie. As a Christian, it was deeply moving to me and there were several times I was in tears. Especially when Luke healed the centurion's daughter, it felt like a miracle.People of faith will have there faith strengthened by this movie.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7736

positive,"  I know a lot of people didnt like this, but i honestly cant figure out why. I know the story is kinda kitchy, and goes a bit all over the place, but i feel like that was intentional. Life is a bit all over the place. Ava duverney was able to fit into a beatly wrapped barra something that isn't totally neatly wrapped at all times. I Enjoyed the story itself and feel like i got what i was promised; a disney movIe with a ""feel good"" ending. I also loved the References throughout to strock Black HISTORICAL FIGURES!

positive,"  I laughed, I cried, I celebrated, I was thankful. It addressed so many of the key issues associated with coming out including the bullying. A film that will help so many young people facing their own ""coming out"" and help them realize it is not really all that scary any more. You still can be you!",Love Simon,7547

positive,"  I like the Tomb Raider series. I have a full collection of Tomb Raider games on steam. I guess this movie should be adapted from a 9th-generation game, but there are many different places. Laura, played by Alicia Veccan, is excellent and I like it very much. I think the original battle is better than the old 2 and hopefully there will be a second one.",Tomb Raider,10285
positive,  I like this Tomb Raider reboot. The main character is much more likable then Angelina. Not sure why Critics are giving it bad reviews.,Tomb Raider,10184

positive,"  I liked it. It was nice to go see a movie that wasn't so politically charged and was made to entertain.This version of Laura Croft is a young vulnerable one who is strong, smart and determined.

positive,  I love buns and I loved this movie,Peter Rabbit,8013
positive,"  I love Love, Simon. Nick Robinson is vulnerable and authentic as 17 year-old Simon, who ""comes out"". Director Greg Berlanti makes this more than the landmark teen gay love story. Love, Simon is about daring to fall in love and being free to be. That is a world we all deserve.Simon eloquently says, ""I'm still me..."" Truth. Love, Simon has such beauty and poignancy. Perhaps, someday what makes Love, Simon so revolutionary will no longer be so.",Love Simon,7359
positive,  I love movies based on books. However I understand that making a children's book into a movie can be very hard. But personally this is the movie for me and it looks really good. I would rather see a bull smell flowers rather than Jedis cutting Droids for 2 hours.,Ferdinand,6008
positive,  I love that it's a stand alone that pays to the 1st film instead of a carbon copy reboot,Jumanji,7016
positive,"  I love the change of pace, the shift of focus and all of the acting. The villain has great motivation and I love how it influences the conclusions the main character reaches, but it's not his acting that stands out to me, but the acting of most everybody else. T'Challa is awesome, his sister and love interest are awesome, and I absolutely love the internal debates of duty vs emotion.",Black Panther,2689

positive,"  I loved it, I simply did. Guillermo del Toro's latest feature has so much soul and heart that elevate this story to other levels. ""The Shape Of Water"" is an otherwordly experience and the movie that made me finally fall for del Toro's style. A very unique story,a very poetic story, a beautiul fairytale. So many themes hidden in this movie,so many subtle points were made. Sally Hawkins dazzled me with her performance, she was magnificent! All performances were exceptional but hers and Jenkins' brought so much soul to their characters. A really great movie!",The Shape of Water,9062

positive,"  I loved that this movie brought out so much butthurt in people. Angry little keyboard warriors whining and crying about how this movie ruined Star Wars -- it's hilarious. The original Star Wars trilogy wasn't that great to begin with and the prequels were abysmal made in America trash. This one is made in America trash, too -- just look at the horrible audience reviews!! You can't argue with that!!Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, midichlorians, silly bad guy names like Dooku and General Grievous, Hayden Christensen's bad acting, Mark Hamill's bad acting, Carrie Fisher's bad acting, Natalie Portman's bad acting, the execrable Padme and Anakin ""romance"" -- that stuff already ruined Star Wars.Hopefully, for the next Star Wars movie, Rose Tico becomes the most powerful Jedi of all time without any training whatsoever and single-handedly destroys Kylo Ren, the First Order, and a whole slew of evil white men.Ha ha, have fun whining and crying, losers!!",The Last Jedi,123

positive,"  I loved the grounded approach to the story. I think a story is always better when there is at least an attempt at plausibility. Tomb Raider delivers on that while still providing plenty of good action. I rather liked the background story, so I don't know what the critics are complaining about. It makes Lara a very real person that many people can relate to, not just some rich girl with a taste for action. Despite the rating by critics who almost always get it wrong, and fanboys who would have rather seen a big tit Lara, I highly recommend this movie!",Tomb Raider,9548

My coming out is still happening 5 years after my big 'outing' and this movie has brought up so many emotions I didn't think I'd have to face again. Anger, sadness and joy.

positive,"  I loved this movie. It was great to see a flawed, yet likeable gay teen character. Better yet, it was nice to see Black and mixed gay characters in a major studio movie. The story was sweet, yet also engaging. The John Hughes tones were clear, yet the message was even better.",Love Simon,7440
positive,"  I loved this movie. My family saw it together (our daughter is 14) and we all loved it. We laughed, we cried, and in the end, our stand-offish teen held her dad's hand through the credits and out of the theatre. I think this is a must see for any teen girls. Its message of positivity and self-worth is one girls need to hear right now. I loved it, and I'd see it again!",A Wrinkle in Time,3437
positive,"  I loved this movie. The characters were more fully fleshed out, the story was exciting, and most importantly, it furthered and deepened the plot of this modern trilogy. Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren, and Daisy Ridley as Rey, were both so well done, completely immersing each character with the struggles of finding his/her place in the force, and from adolescence into adulthood. The throne room scene was hands down the best light-saber fight sequence in all of Star Wars. The music was absolutely wonderful, punctuating the ebb and flow of the storyline in the masterful way Williams has done with every Star Wars movie. Most importantly, what TFA & TLJ accomplish and is so needed in Hollywood, is representation! Heroes that are women, people of color, and perhaps even of different orientations, are so important to see on the big screen. And these heroes and villains are absolutely relatable to all of us, no matter our background. This is why I hold this movie up there with one of my absolute favorite recent movies, along with Black Panther. The latter a whole other review of superb performances and characters that appeal to all generations and backgrounds. I'm shocked by it's low audience score, especially rating this below the Prequels, which were unwatchable and horrible to sit through in the theaters. TLJ will one day be looked at as the perfect bridge between TFA and #9. I will agree that I am not such a fan of the Canto Bight sequence, outside of the character development opportunities it gave Finn, Rose & DJ. It did seem excessively long. And yes, it was hard to see Luke's portrayal as less of a guide and more of an angry and forgotten hero - yet what a commentary on how we treat elders in our society. And what a journey his character traverses throughout TLJ, confronting his own demons and internalizing the importance of embracing failure. Watching the extras, including Rian Johnson's documentary ""Director & the Jedi"" as well as his additional commentary, helped me fuse all the pieces to understand his vision for this movie, and how it fits into the big picture of these characters' respective heroes journeys.I can't wait until the next movie, and have high hopes that JJ Abrams will tie up the series in a thoughtful, edge-of-our-seat, fantastic way that the Original Trilogy did for us so long ago. I am a big fan of the entire Original Trilogy, Star Wars Rebels & Forces of Destiny. Was not a fan of the Prequels or Rogue One (despite liking Jyn Erso).",The Last Jedi,865
positive,"  I loved this movie. The plot was interesting and the characters were funny. I loved all the pop-culture references and easter eggs.

I can understand it if you LOVE this amazing movie (pretty much the majority of the movie goers and fans) to continue talking about it. But to continue to dog is not only such a waste of time but so, so sad. 48% polled on this site did not like it...that's about 95 to 97, 000 out of 187,000. and if you dumbasses think that represents a majorty of fans and movie goers alike, you're simply paralyzed from teh neck up! LOL! Don't kid yours;eves, the movie rocked, it made it's money and then some...noone one person with a brain thought it was going to pull in TFA numbers so quit trying to justify your hatred by attempting to play number games of its success! And BTW, plot holes are not the equivalent to a plot you did not care for. An amazing plot with character development and growth by a first rate writer in Ryan Johnson! And if you're too stupid to recognize it, then you have no hope. For the rest of us , this film is a NEW HOPE in what this franchise needed to stay alive and relevant.

positive,"  I plan to see it in theater again, and buy the UHD version when available for home. Nuff said... If you like this genre you'll love this movie. It's not without its flaws, but they are few and far enough between to be excused. It is one of those movies where you may think it is ""about"" some theme, on reflection later to realize for you it is about something else entirely. I've heard many interpretations of that, so will not spoil it for you. There are movies where I know that someday I will think back to when I first saw it.

positive,"  I read Jeff V.'s novel, really liked it and felt this was excellent--although not 100% faithful--adaptation (and that's OK--there were elements the movie did better, in my opinion). The screenplay took some liberties to create more visual tension and excitement without losing the fundamental question of ""what does it mean to be human"" and ""what is the meaning of life""? I think this belongs up there with other ""big question"" movies such as Blade Runner. The pacing reminded me of ""Arrival""--thoughtful nuance and backstory interspersed with action and unveiling. I disagree with other critics that the characters were wooden and needed more development. They are developed just enough for us to care for them and to show their humanity and their imperfection--but their complicated back-stories don't bog down the fantastic discovery in the movie. This is great entertainment, excellent acting, and fantastic imaginative visuals--saw it twice and enjoyed it immensely both times.",Annihilation,4541

There were some real shining moments in this film and the 4 kids that I took to see this film liked it better than Coco (I did too). The characters were loveable and the story endearing. I have a feeling your kids will absolutely love this movie even if you are a bit on the fence about it. And lets be honest, you are not going out of your way to watch animated films for yourself as there are much more entertaining films for adults in the world.",Ferdinand,5946
positive,"  I really enjoyed this film. The production value was quite high and the storytelling was solid. The dynamic between the three male figures was really well done and conveyed very nicely, the different stages these men were in their faiths. There was not as much action as the trailer implied and I enjoyed that, as there were several quiet moments where the story was able to be more subtle and I appreciated that spacious feel that those moments were given, There was also a lovely addition of some gallows humor between Paul and Luke that I really loved. In the end I cried and was left filled with awe at the sacrifice the early Christians were forced to endure for their faith. I would highly recommend this film.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7820

positive,"  I really enjoyed this movie, I really like the acting throughout the movie, for example when one of the misses was being sarcastic. That was funny.",A Wrinkle in Time,3192
positive,  I really enjoyed this movie. Obviously some liberties have to be taken since we don't know all that happened during the persecution of the church in Rome and right before Paul's death. But the movie is solid in scripture. I felt they depicted Paul well. Luke was awesome. People forget when reading scripture that Paul and all the disciples were real people with real emotions. Paul had to wrestle through all the things we do in our hearts. He had a past that he had to surrender to Jesus. I like his vulnerability. The love we are to live with is demonstrated great. The persecution and the challenge that it poses was clearly portrayed. I would recommend this movie to any Christian and anyone seeking truth. And let this prepare you for what could easily take place in the US. Our brothers and sisters are already suffering all over the world.,Paul Apostle of Christ,7786
positive,"  I really enjoyed Tomb Raider, much more than i expected to. It's a fun throwback to the old Indiana Jones movies, with some great action and set pieces. But it's really Alicia Vikander that sells this thing . Her Lara Croft is more real, more vulnerable than the Angelina Jolie characterization. She is not a superhero, but a human being who makes mistakes, gets injured and really feels like she is in way over head, which adds stakes to her journey. And Alicia is such a talented actress, bringing so much nuance to the role that it is hard to keep your eyes off her. I hope that people give this film a shot, and that it ends up generating sequels. I want to see more of Alicia Vikander as Lara Crioft!",Tomb Raider,10306
positive,"  I REALLY liked it! Is it the same as the book? No, of Course not. Are there some things I wish they had included? Absolutely. But, go see it! do Not expect the director to have imagined the story the way you did as a child. It's different, but good!

positive,"  I saw ""Paul, Apostle of Christ"". I found it AMAZING. Although some of it is not in the Bible it is only meant for pacing. It didn't deviate whatsoever Biblically as far as I can tell. Will need read Acts and maybe some of Luke to be certain. The film is quite dark but there are moments of joy as it rightfully should be depicted. Although the commercials make it seem it is only Paul's last days there are flashbacks visually or through the actor (James Faulkner)who portrayed Paul. I have not seen this much attention to stay true to the Bible since ""The Passion of the Christ"".",Paul Apostle of Christ,7654

They managed to do a good job of mixing the virtual world with real world and making the danger be in both worlds. It was very well thought out. I was skeptical at first, I am not a fan of dystopian society movies, however it was very good. Of course it would be a Steven Spielberg movie. He only does good movies. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that he has made that wasn't good. He is just a great story teller. Very talented and seems to think outside the box.

positive,"  I strongly recommend people go to the nearest theater and see ""Annihilation"".You could also use the proxmate chrome extension, select the UK as your region, and watch it on Netflix*.* Long story short, Netflix bought the rights to the film, but it was marketed for release in the US with underwhelming box office numbers. Ipso facto, you can watch it this way. It probably won't accept your password, so just change it for that visit.If you've seen the previews, you're probably thinking, why is he recommending an alien SciFi horror flick, will we make it in time, and why did I bring helium instead of air? Aside from the fact that Natalie Portman is my shalomie homie and can rap better than Post Malone, this movie is intense--visually, suspensefully, and emotionally**.** Full disclosure: I did watch this movie the first time on 1.0 metric spores of Boomers. 9/10 will do again with 1.0 more just for the visuals.*** Warning - Slight spoilers ahead, but mostly just framing how the movie should/might be interpreted ***Here's the thing--the movie is an allegory for depression. It's loosely based off the first book in the Southern Reach Trilogy. Some key parts are there, but it largely diverges from the series. The movie is written and directed by the same guy (Alex Garland) that gave us another brilliant piece of SciFi cinematic excellence, ""Ex Machina"".Annihilation is, as it's mentioned in the film--self destruction, juxtaposed against an alien/biological ""virus"". The Shimmer (Area X in the book) is depression. Some fight it, face it, let it consume them (Just when you thought DiCaprio had it bad going against a bear in ""The Revenant""), or just accept it as a part of them. The dialogue throughout the movie is very revealing, especially when you think about it abstractly as if you are viewing the depression/shimmer and every character in it from a first person point-of-view with a third person perspective.What?! Exactly.There will be a scene where Lena (Natalie Portman) and Sheppard (Tuva Novotny) are rowing on a boat through the swamp--at this point Sheppard provides all the baggage for every character (an alcoholic, someone suicidal/scarred, someone fighting cancer, someone that's lost someone else, and someone that's lost themself because of a loss). It's very poignant dialogue.Are there gruesome scenes that might make it difficult to watch? Yes. Of course. It's a SciFi horror flick, you dingus! But you know what? Depression is hard to face and look at, and sometimes you have to have a friend cut you open and show your insides moving around to know that things are changing.Ultimately, people go into it and never really come out. If they do--are they different, or just fooling themselves and everyone else into thinking they are?",Annihilation,3889

positive,"  I think a good chunk of viewers did not fully comprehend this film. Annihilation is not just a movie, it's an experience. It's full of meaning those at the surface need to grasp. I came in expecting a sci-fi thriller, but I left with something more. Annihilation presents us with stunning visuals and entrancing music. As big of a fever dream as it feels, I think that was the point. To make it so bizarre that only those who dipped below the surface would be able to understand. This movie may look like nothing but nonsense to some, but to me, it was a work of art. The characters, the plot, the visuals, the score, the concepts.

The ""it"" they speak of in the movie proves mass consciousness, with Stephen Kings ""It"". There is an evil force that proves jealousy and anger etc that spreads across the world. The reviews on this movie is a pure example of this It that is taking over man kind. This movie was GLORIOUS and to everyone involved - job well done.

positive,"  i thought this movies had great pacing, and was a really good revamp on the story. I really hope they continue this franchise.",Tomb Raider,9539
positive,"  I Thought This Was a lot of fun and I Would Say This Was Dreaded Video Game to movie I Loved Angelia Jolie Tomb Raider a lot of fun, Simon West Film a lot of fun expect Sequel Tomb Raider Cradle to Life was ok wasn't bad but I Would Say This Is A Lot of Fun Movie Then To Tomb Raider Cradle To Life, I Thought Alicia Vikander did a great job as Lara Croft I Really Liked Her As Lara Croft Thank Goodness they hired Great Actress, Lucky for Me They Didn't Hire Rubbish Trash Actress But Alicia Nails Her Role. I Thought Story Was Really Good Close To Game I Don't Understand why does this Gets Hates for ? But It Wasn't Very LOW Rating to movie, But I Hope they make more Sequels Make More of them Without Destroying Them In Pieces Like Cradle to Life That Was Mostly Destroyed Sadly I Thought it was ok sequel but wasn't best as First, Story Thought went well in good direction movie entire doesn't slaright Forward Paced. This Has Nothing To Do With Angelia Jolie Franchise. This is Like Reboot Like To Any Another Movies Like James Bond To Different Franchise To Another In Here The Movie Focused On Lara Croft Early Days. Which Means The Movie Was More of An Origin Story of Lara Croft. Story Follows Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) makes a living as a bike courier, she trains MMA as well Witch I Thought She Should get Very Series for Her MMA Career. But Anyway Story Doesn't Follow MMA anyways, She Is Following the disappearance of her father Richard Croft witch Lara reluctantly accepts and Founds access to her father's office. There she finds a Pr-recorded Message from Richard Croft (Dominic West) detailing his Research Into Himiko, The Mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to Command The Power Over Life and Death. Richard Warns Lara to Destroy all of his research he has but Lara decides not to so she can Investigate Further. She goes to travels to Hong Kong she founds Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) Into the Badlands, captain of the ship Endurance his character play's Drunken Boat Captain That's How I Should Put It That Way he then Agrees to go for Adventure to Devils Sea to the island of Yamatai, The ship capsizes in a violent Crazy storm and Heavy Rain Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. she gets Rescued from member of Trinity's she wakes up and meets Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) Justified, Shield, Django Unchained, Hateful Eight. He play's really good villain in this movie I Would say he is a better villain to Ciar·n Hinds Jonathan Reiss witch i thought he was lamest Villain In Tomb Raider Cradle to Life, Mathias Vogel the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organisation called Trinity that seeks to harness and weaponise Himiko's power. he has all Prisoners digging holes to find Himiko. now this movie has a lot of fun action a lot of Adventure just like in game or should I Say action/adventure movie that will remind you a little bit of Indiana Jones ? Adventure style, I Don't Want to go further but there is surprised Twist of movie you don't see it coming, I Thought Action was a lot of fun just like Simon West Tomb Raider, it's pretty Watchable fun, Movie Breaks Long Dreaded Video Game It's Close To Game. Tend to Compare It With Angelina Jolie's version but this movie turns out to be they are both much better of Tomb Raider films then to Sequel Tomb Raider Cradle to Life. I Am Big Fan Of Angelina Jolie's 1st Lara Croft which was over-the-top But I Love Over Top Movies Depends Witch Over The Top It Goes For. It's Enjoyable But this one is more grounded and real for people who likes to look for realistic. to me i don't care what if it is Realistic or not but hey when movie is Unreal it's still great it's movie what do you expect ? If Movie is too Realistic then it would be BORING. That's How It Gets Entering for Everyone. I Am so Happy That Finally we got a motion picture well adapted from a game. If They Continue from Angelia Jolie Franchise then who knows I Might Like It But This Reboot is great. it's Largely Based on 2013 Tomb Raider game and Some Action Sequences Reminds me of Uncharted series. but A LOT DIFFERENT, I Thought Thing Is there is NO POINT HAVING Nick Frost in movie when he is in it like 4 minutes then at end of movie he is in it like less ? but anyway he doesn't destroy this movie. movie is not disappointing don't ever pay attention To Die Hard Game lovers this movie will NOT DISAPPOINT YOU believe me it's not really that bad of movie, The director was Roar Uthaug, a Norwegian film maker whose prior experience were directing Norwegian films. But I personally think he did wonderful job on the action sequences. but This movie needs more high voltage Action in this movie, but this needs more of action in it, but movie wasn't boring at all pretty watchable then it really gets to action, but this needs more amazing action like Simon West Flick. The special effects were good, and the CGI was done neatly & nicely. If you enjoy this kind of movie or if you are a fan of Tomb Raider games, then I think it would be satisfying. But if you want to see a lot of the tomb raiding scenes like in the previous Tomb Raiders movies, or if you are looking for the Indiana Jones quality, well this is not be too fulfilling. for you i give this 9.10 I Will Buy It On Blu Ray.",Tomb Raider,9526

positive,  I took a bunch of of 7-9 year olds for my kid's birthday.They loved it!! I enjoyed it as well but yes it's not a 'frozen' or 'LEGO movie'or other such blockbuster movie with mass appeal . It is appealing to kids with a good message. Watch it!,Sherlock Gnomes,8197

positive,"  I understand why people don't like it as much, but honestly. I liked it, right from the beginning. After watching it multiple times it only reinforces how great I think it is. Are there parts I don't like? Yes, of course (looking at you Canto Bight), but I think on the whole, the movie didn't play it safe. It gave Star Wars fans something new and interesting. I think the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship is one of the most compelling story arcs in the whole series. He was too powerful at too young an age and the adults in his life didn't know how to deal with him. He had no one in his corner. It's no wonder he was so easily manipulated by Snoke and the dark side. But now there's Rey in his life. She will be his guiding light. She also feels like no one was ever in her corner. And the person she thought was going to step into that role (Luke) didn't. Ben was there, and he did help her. She sees the good in him and wants so badly to save him. In the end, even though they fought together, She can't stay, he won't leave, but they're connected. I ardently believe neither of them can kill the other. They're 2 sides of the same coin. I want her to help redeem him so badly in 9. I want them to dissolve the first order together, but I'm afraid the 'redeemed Skywalker' trope is too tired. Please JJ Abrams, don't ruin this for me. I like Luke's arc, as well as Poe's. I thought they both really developed as characters. Initially I really disliked Finn's story, but after multiple viewings I changed my mind. Rose and DJ are like the angel and devil on Finn's shoulders. DJ was what Finn was; Focused on saving himself. Don't join, run away. But Rose is the opposite; duty, honor, courage. He struggles throughout the movie with both sides of himself, but Rose and the resistance win him over. I'm hoping in the next movie he'll be less selfish. I don't know where they're going to take his character. Over all I thought it was a fantastic addition to the series. It wasn't perfect, but I liked that it wasn't cookie cutter. I am so excited to see what JJ Abrams brings us for 9!",The Last Jedi,861
positive,  I walked in with low expectations and walked out really glad I saw this movie.,Tomb Raider,10034
positive,"  I want everyone associated with this movie to make the Trump movie when it comes out! Brilliant, hilarious, unusual. Simon Russel Beale is a gem turning one of histories worst players into well, a comedic monster. Buscemi is perfect, as he always is, I laughed out loud a dozen times, at least, and after, went to looking these people up. Had to know the real stories and - amazingly - this isn't far from the truth. Congratulations to all involved.",The Death of Stalin,8243
positive,"  I want to note foremost that there is a campaign to bring the score on this movie down. This 2018, and this makes the power of the movie more amplified. I saw this movie twice in theaters because the meaning and the story was so moving.",Black Panther,2212
positive,  I want to see it waaaa,Coco,4983
positive,"  I want to watch Black Panther again but after a day reflecting on the film, I'd say it's one of the best of the MCU and of superhero films in general. You get what you want like people fighting each other (and really well done one on one combat) but a lot of the great weight of the film that stands out is the excellent score and strong writing for it's cast of characters and their moments. Every character is a realized one and has an essential role and function that makes sense for the story. Also this movie proves you can have a heroic and strong main character and also have strong supporting characters - many of whom are women - who are equal to the hero without tearing down the hero. Black Panther is strong as the Black Panther sure but Okoye, Nakia, Shuri, even Agent Ross all felt like they played an essential part in helping Black Panther suceed and save the day by each having strengths that BP just doesn't have.Also Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains which is saying something since (contrary to what clickbait articles will lead you to believe) Marvel has many great antagonists. Ultron, Loki, Kilgrave, Nebula, Ego, but Killgrave differed by going a route with his character and motivations that I'm sure no other film studio has the stones to address. The movie addresses race and the repurcussions of history and how it affects the present and how people of the present all are figuring out what to do to move forward towards the future and the answer isn't so simple either leading to many of the characters beyond just Black Panther learning and growing over the course of the movie.Oh and aside from the last credits scene, Black Panther is simply a contained Marvel movie. It's not trying to set up Infinity War or focused on the wider universe - it focuses squarely on Wakanda and it's characters and while ultimately what happens in Wakanda could have a bigger impact on the planet, when watching the film the characters are so good and so well written and realized that you completely forget about Iron Man and the Avengers who are also on the same planet. They don't matter really which is kind of a breath of fresh air.The movie was like Game of Thrones in it's approach to politics as King T'Challa is the ruler of Wakanda and Wakanda itself is kind of a character. The film is about just how this country will carry on towards the future and what it will do about it's past as Black Panther and his allies and even enemies are at a crossroads at what to do. It's a damn good film.",Black Panther,2017

positive,"  I was born in 71 - right in the sweetspot for this movie - I played Adventure, Spielberg and Lucas productions fueled my imagination, and then I learned not only that it was OK to be a geek or weird, but to celebrate it thanks to the John Hughes.I was not expecting to love this movie and it would got he way of John Carter, Valerian, Star Wars Prequels and Transformers sequels.This movie exceeded expectations on all counts. Not every movie needs a purpose beyond entertainment, Most people don't ride a roller coaster to find themselves, they just want entertainment.

While the other films were amazing, they felt more like a video game (which they are) but this one feels more like a true action film to me! This movie makes me feel like I'm in the world of Lara and the other characters. I was amazed by the stunts. In an interview I briefly heard Alicia talking about doing stunts but I wasn't sure if they were done all by her. Props to whoever did them! They were amazing! Alicia can fill Angelina's position quite well and I'd look forward to seeing another Tomb Raider film or a film following Lara Croft.",Tomb Raider,9581

positive,"  I was taken aback at every 5 minutes. Got in the movie theater thinking I was going to watch just a far-fetched sci-fi love story. but how wrong i wasWhat most struck me was the breaking of every possible paradigm in main stream plots , tearing apart our socially constructed ideas of what the ""good guy"" should do or be like. All characters are rebellious here, all trying to fight back against the system. The outcasts of society all thriving to survive. It also, underneath, depicts an old America secluded in racism and prejudice..",The Shape of Water,9233
positive,"  I was totally blown away by this movie! It's inspiring, emotional, stunning and filled with wonderful music. A very strong comeback for Pixar! Gracias!",Coco,5645
positive,"  I was very, very impressed by this movie. I've seen a few teenage coming-of-age films over the years, and this film blew all out those out of the water. To start off, its very well done. From the writing, to the progression of the story, to the acting of the cast, I was very impressed by the overall quality of it. A lot of thought went into trying to render the film believable and honest, and it shows in the final cut. The movie is also surprisingly funny! I was honestly shocked by how funny it was. The dialogue is really witty and any scene involving the drama teacher is absolutely hilarious. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Between the honesty and hilarity of the script, and the effortless flow of the movie, I would highly recommend it. I think everyone can enjoy this film as well. When I saw it the audience ranged from teenage girls to married couples, and everyone seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Bottom line, I highly recommend it!",Love Simon,7512

positive,"  I watched this in the theater then rented at home, through here and all the negative reviews are from people who did not understand this movie, or did not want it to go their way. This movie is way better than I thought watching it the second time, without all the preconceived biases I had because of all the negativity around it. Watching it with an open mind, not only is this a great movie, but it is most defiantly a Star Wars movie and holds true to the Star Wars paradigm! Don't let the naysayers distract you from watching this great movie and forming a preconceived bias against it. Rotten Tomatoes has the critics at 91% saying it is a great movie, and they are right!",The Last Jedi,548
positive,"  I watched this movie and I loved it. It was a beautiful romantic love story.

There was none of the campiness of the originals which I was glad to see. With it being basically an origin film, there was some setup in the beginning which was expected but interesting to see her backstory.

positive,"  I will admit given the current political climate and what people had been saying, and not being a fan of the main actor ( I tend to find him stiff and borish ). I even heard it was the best MCU movie BEFORE it was released ( Overhype before release usually bad sign, RE: The current Star Wars Movies, anything with Rhianna in it ) so I had real low expectations. I was sorely mistaken, I wouldn't and won't say it was THE BEST MCU movie EVER.. ( like others ), but it was well written, well acted. Yes, its a mainly Black cast, Black actor, etc.. But thats neither the focal point, nor in anyway something you ""think about"". In the same way The Walking Dead is not about Zombies and you forget about the Zombies as you get engrossed by the story and the acting, the same is true of Black Panther. The story is set in Africa, so yes the characters are African, and the country is African, and the story line revolves around this African country. They happen to be black, because they are African thats it. There are social elements injected into the story line but not in what you would expect. Is this the BEST Superhero or MCU movie.. ? No, thats simply hyperbolic, Is it some blacksplotation MCU movie railing ""Against the man"", Nope not that BS either. What it is is a great Superhero movie, and in my top 2. Behind Dr Strange. Becuase that movie set the bar... Overall great movie, great writing, and goes without saying great visuals",Black Panther,2714

I didn't see anything involving racism like some people trying to make it look. You always have those who find bad things about any movie and even cartoons.  I think is a movie for everybody to see disregarding who you are. When I went to see this movie the audience was very diverse and people applaud at the end of the movie. You don't see this kind of people's reaction for a movie that much nowadays. When they show women warriors in this movie, they were not kidding. They have some nice martial arts skills.

positive,"  If you only saw the trailer for ""Annihilation"" you'd think it's another shock and shooting horror flick wrapped in a thinly veiled google-deep-dream scifi wrapper. But it is SOOO much better than that. It is a terrifyingly vivid and raw demonstration of what ""life"" is at it's core, and how the tendrils of its outward expression fractal into everything that makes us, kills us, and will replace us. In the film these soul rattling and seemingly urgent concepts are expressed through and alongside the same backdrop of deep-dream surreal beautiful scramblings and Time/space/ego-melting that accompany them when they arrise from high doses of hallucinogens.In other words, if you have taken high doses of hallucinogens and wished there was a film that could accurately portray the beauty and the terror in a way that maintains a meaningful form even into the sober side - watch this film If you have not taken high doses of hallucinogens and wondered what the fuck your druggie friends meant by ""it's like we're all connected man, but like in a fractal way"" then also watch this film.",Annihilation,4083

positive,"  If you were to think, the chaos that erupted in Stalin's Central Committee, immediately following his death, sounds like the perfect setting for a political satire, then you would be right. Armando Iannucci's film manages to take a distinctly dark period in history, and reenact it, with an immaculate balance of horror and comedy.It is a success in three key areas - firstly, the writing - despite how the trailer is cut, this is not in any way a farce. The comedy is subtle, with jokes taking time to hit their punchlines, often many scenes down the line, which makes the payoff all the more effective. The second element in it's accomplishment, does really counter-balance the first, in that the casting and performances are universally outstanding - it was a masterstroke to allow the actors to speak with their native accents, and not attempt to mock Russian ones, as it grants them freedom to hone their comedic interactions with each other and doesn't distract the audience unnecessarily.Finally, it is historically accurate - people were living in a climate of total fear, terrified of making any mistake under threat of imprisonment or execution. What the film does, is create this sense of dread, even among the powerful members of Stalin's central committee (who seem still terrified of him even after he is dead), and allow the nervous humour to play off of it. I think the best comedies always have this sense of trepidation balanced with the chuckles, and this is where the movie succeeds ultimately. You learn as you laugh, and although there are some distinctly dark moments throughout, the film never deviates from it's ultimate goal, of providing comic relief.",The Death of Stalin,8333

I loved the one with Robin Williams, and I'm tired of remakes, reboots, and even sequels to some extent. But as I saw more and more previews, I really began to change my opinion on whether I would see this movie. Finally got to see it last week, and I can't say enough great things about it. The premise of the story is the same: people get trapped in a game. But the way the story played out was new. The story was very well written. The action was fun. There was a lot of comedic events within the movie as well as some moments hat might make you tear up a little. The call-back to the original movie was brilliant. All the actors did a great job.

It's a great movie with a great message, it's not only about peace and freedom, it's about animal rights and how we use them as items. The book from where the movie is based on was banned in Spain during the francoist era for their ""depraved"" message, still a lot of work to do here in my land and the world, these kind of movies for kids and adults are so need for the future. It amazes me in a really bad way how the movie is not getting the importance that it deserves. Actual society is not ready for these kind of messages but I'm totally sure that in the future and I want to believe it, the society will be better and take this movie as referent.

positive,"  I'm not the typical 14-year-old girl. I am not a big fan of love stories. I find them very clichÈ and not that enjoyable to watch. This movie is an exception! I actually really like the romance in this movie. This film is about a closeted gay teen named Simon (Nick Robinson) who, after learning about another gay kid on a school website, begins to search for him while also figuring out how to come out. The most important aspect of this movie is, of course, the fact that this is a gay love story. I feel like this movie handles the whole thing very well and very respectfully. It's a very positive and inspirational film. But it's also a gay love story in mainstream media. This is not an Indie film. It is a story about LGBT love that is in wide release. I believe this movie makes a very big step in normalizing LGBT characters in mainstream media, made specifically for teens. But this movie isn't just amazing for that. I love this story in general. It's kind of a mystery and comedy with a little touch of love. Who is Blue? You really get into the mystery. I remember tensing up and whispering to myself whenever I was scared for the characters. I became so invested in them and hoped it was the person I wanted it to be. It is also about friendship and how fragile our friendships can be and how we use and treat people.The characters boil down to one trait as their whole personality, but I still liked them. I would have liked to see more depth in Simon's friend circle. I like Abby's (Alexandra Shipp) character the most. She's Simon's newest friend who has just moved from D.C. and it seems like every guy is interested in her. But she is not the typical ""hot teen, mean girl,"" she is kind. Simon, of course, is a total show stealer. Not surprising at all, Simon is a charming character who you wish you were best friends with too. You just want him to find Blue so he can be happy because, as the movie posters say, ""Everyone deserves a great Love Story."" My only issues with this movie come down to how weird the theatre teacher and the vice principal are. They are a little over the top. While I liked Ms. Albright (Natasha Rothwell), she swore at students (which isn't allowed), even though they deserved it. And, it felt as if the vice principal (Tony Hale) clearly wanted to be seen as cool, but he ends up being way too invested in people's love lives. All in all, I love this romantic comedy and give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18.reviewed by calista b., kids first! film critic. for more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",Love Simon,7254

positive,"  I'm probably gonna be talking about this movie all year. There are personal criticism and objective. Objectively speaking no one can deny this is a brilliant film. It has phenomenal production design, excellent and emotional cinematography, a brilliant and thought-provoking story, and brilliant performances and execution all around. ""Annihilation"" is a triumph of cinema. A true ""modern-day classic"" of a film if there ever was one. A film that falls into the category of films that embrace Big Ideas in ways that presuppose viewers are intelligent and attentive. Is that asking too much from the average movie-goer? Full of fresh perspectives and a powerful message ""Annihilation"" makes you think. It makes you wonder about the mysteries of genetics and the fragility of DNA. It makes you think about what happens when parts of the body no longer feel familiar and how quickly those changes can arise. It asks about the human capacity for self-destruction and it explores the power of guilt.Garland deserves all the praise he is getting. And should apologize to no one. The studio should be ashamed for limiting this film.",Annihilation,4518

positive,"  Impossible to speak of ""Black Panther"" without hitting the key (and with all right) of the representativeness, the importance of this film for a part of the population that few times was protagonist .. represented of heroic form.Finally, the film raises these discussions but treated as just another part of the already extensive MCU, the film fits and excels in Ryan Coogler's sharp technique in the quick and didactic story set in a unique moment in American history the only one that defines the entire line of the film, the quest for tactile reality ... even though it is primarily a fantasy of Marvel superheroes. That has all his way of being, winner .. but here Ryan gets more polarized the jokes are punctual quick .. many comes from the relationship Shuri and T'challa in this brother thing. The movie has this sort of thing ""lion king"", loss of the father..the rise means the forceps of a new king..meio that without knowing the way forward before the challenges faced by this Wakanda..so rich and technological .. but closed to the world for so long. The other side of the coin that ambitions the throne Erik Killmonger, has different plans for this nation in dispute. A young man with thirst for revenge who does not hesitate to achieve his goals, with fury and savagery does not measure efforts in the ends that he believes justify the means. Villain, fanatic, terrorist ... he may be all these things ... but the origin of the young person who does not justify his actions ... is a considerable motor force ... he has the motivation the reason to be so. And Michael B. Jordan manages to convey this in every scene in every angry speech, every act of Killmonger ... sympathy would not say, but you almost understand your motives. The movie walks true, beautiful .. you look at Wakanda and see her pretty colorful, organic and technological .. something that could have been .. happened if they had the chance, if they had the power over themselves. You look at that look and smile if you imagine it there. The cast is also impressed by the commitment to truthfulness by the transmission of feeling, placed in each expression. I think from the moment that film could reach so many people, so many lives they wanted their performances to reflect on those lives. The importance of this film, perhaps in the history of the cinema so rich is small, but with whom he intends to speak and whoever is willing to listen to it will be very important and represent a lot. The politics embedded in it shows current..the conflicts shown..the fears and intolerances treated to a lesser or greater degree, are sharp and speak with this generation. Black Panther was created in the 60s / 70s, a time of racial tension, a black panthers group, and even today it is necessary and punctual. Preaching diversity, respect for the different and unity as if we were all part of a beautiful and numerous tribe.",Black Panther,1942

positive,"  In an age of Marvel and Fast and the Furious it's just oh so refreshing to come across a piece of film that is actually art as well. The Shape of Water is by no means a perfect film, regardless of it's Oscar nominations. In fact, at it's core it's a very excellent retelling of Beauty & The Beast. In film, and life, it's never about the destination. The journey is the story. This story has a journey. One that will keep you interested and wondering and maybe even spark some inspiration deep inside you that you never knew you had. This is a story of humanity and love and maybe moreover, who exactly gets to define what either of those things are.I haven't seen all of the Best Picture noms, but I have changed my mind from Three Billboards to Shape. Three is more than deserving. The story and performances are stellar and deserved of recognition. Sally Hawkins however, steals the show. He performance as a meek, caring, loving mute is simply masterful. The emotion expressed in her face and through every sign (sign language) can be felt by the audience. She seems to transcend what it means to connect with a character when all you can do is feel what they feel instead of simply agreeing or disagreeing.If Shape ends up taking Best Picture, I will not be disappointed. If any of you out there are on the fence about seeing this film, remember that it is a beautiful love story and not an action movie about a fishman. Don't watch trailers and immerse yourself in the world Del Toro creates. You will not be disappointed.tl;dr - A stellar film with high caliber performances. Don't miss the best film of the year.

The new installment to the best film franchise has little to no flaws and should be seen by everyone. It is truly an amazing blockbuster film that should be Oscar nominated and Oscar winning. Sherlock Gnomes is a cinematic masterpiece. You need a IQ over 200 to comprehend the genius of this movie. Now critics have been rating this film down, but those are just haters that deserve to be dabbed on to the fullest extent. They are just a bunch of Gnomist! We must stop this gnome racism!! I will stand for a 10/10 movie with no flaws get slaughtered by this Gnome inequality!!! #Gnomelivesmatter #GomeequalityNow the genius of a director, John Stevenson, provides an amazing original story about love, importance of partnership, and the current state of racism in our political news. The surprising plot twist are amazingly surprising and leaves at the edge of your seat the whole movie. And if you are wondering, yes there is at least one dab. Watching that for the first will definitely not make question your life choices and leave you asking yourself, ""What terrible life choices have I committed in my life to be here,"" yeah you won't feel like that. But remember as amazing as this movie is there is one flaw. In the ended the Characters don't fuck. Yes, yet again you will be left with the feeling of what jacksfilms left when he finished watching the emoji movie and I quote ""Blue Balls."" Now I think an appropriate ending to this film would have an ending similar to that of sausage party's. But if you are like me, or any normal person, you had your hand in your pants under your underwear, waiting for that perfect moment to ejaculate, and it never came. You will either have to wait until you get home to finish, or you could do what I did which is finish in the bathroom while the images of the movie are still fresh in your head, because if there is one word I could describe Juliet is THICCC, with 3 c's. That is why you will be left with blue balls. The characters got that junk in the trunk, if you know what I mean hehehe (even the frog). Another complaint, there is no twerking. I mean you give the character that back and you don't even make'em shake'em. But those are just minor flaws that don't really effect the film that much. Another thing that is amazing about the film is the side plot about Benny wanting to bang the frog. It is amazing little love story that I would want to see the abominations that they would call their children. The character development is also an aspect that is handled perfectly. Sherlock Gnomes and Juliet go from being assholes to not assholes. The dialogue is also superb. From the jokes to the serious moments, you will find that the dialogue will always be the most perfect thing to say in that situation. And I will go into a spoiler for a couple of these sentences so I will just say, if you have not watched this masterpiece of a film just skip over this because this film is a must watch. So anyway, there is a tragic and heartbreaking death that will definitely make you cry is you are a decent human being. If you do not cry at this scene you are a soulless and heartless human being that does not cry at all and I want nothing to do with you (asshole) not you only the people that do not cry at this scene. Which will be no one I assure you. Yes Sherlock Gnome's very own assistant Watson does break and it is the saddest moment in film history. This scene is so well done and emotional, because the director and writer does and amazing job at making love and feel for these characters. I know that when I experience this very #emotional scene I was heartbroken and just sobbing. I was crying out loud, could not believe it. That is the only spoiler in this review, I'm sorry I had to spoil that it is just the most emotional experience you will ever get to see.In summary, Sherlock Gnomes is the finest piece of cinema I have seen since Gnomeo & Juliet. It rivals and manages to beat all of Shakespeare's work (including the very play the characters are inspired by ""The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet). It is the definition of what a cinematic masterpiece is and what films should aspire to be.",Sherlock Gnomes,8192

positive,"  It can be very difficult to make a biblical movie. There is a lot of pressure to creat a film that many would believe the source of the story to be fictional and produce a plausable narritive. This film exceeded my expectations. I really didn't know what to expect going into this film after recently viewing ""Samson,"" however, I was thankful I gave it a shot.The production of this film was above average. CGI was not overdone and the acting was inviting into simple biblical narritive that didn't overwhelm nor undercut the struggle of first century life for the believer in Jesus.I was pleased by the accuracy of the historical evidence we have and more over this story didn't attempt to make everything supernatural and mystical. It was encouraging to see the struggle of faith in Jesus as Christ was a challenge from the very beginning of the church.I'm no expert in movie reviews, but I wanted to say this film deserves a go for the person of faith. Again, this film offers a ""plausable"" account of the beginning life of the church. I don't think the message of the film is to convince you that this is what happened at the end of Pauls life. It is a fresh invitation to consider our life, our struggle and our message of the gospel of Jesus to the world we live in.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7672

positive,"  It is a children's movie. The Quantum Physics is mentioned and I hope adults will investigate some of the terms, like ""frequency"" that have lessons for adults. I enjoyed the quotes and theme of the show.",A Wrinkle in Time,3222

positive,"  it is a wonderful movie able to share the love for more than videogames but the pop culture of the 80s so well., a couple of things were a little to ""scriptd"" but that was fidelity to the text.Many many details that stik to the book and didn't got explined in the movie shows dedication.

positive,"  It is missing the first few chapters of the book but that makes sense once you see the movie. They completely changed gate 2, but also understandable. I loved this book and this movie is tremendous. This one is a must see. A whole lot of fun!",Ready Player One,1316
positive,  It is rare for me to see a movie in theaters. However my girlfiriend and I both watch this movie and absolutely loved it. the sci-fi/thriller/horror themes were backed up by the visuals and universe created during the run time. I enjoy trying to figure out a movie as it goes and Annihilation catered to the need and then some. scientific minds will love this movie and its VARYING twist.,Annihilation,4076
positive,  It is really hard to make me cry. This movie made me cry so hard. Straight 5 stars,Coco,5537
positive,"  It is so refreshing to have a comedy that isn't reliant on making dirty/lewd jokes which is fine, but having an all around comedy makes it more interesting. This movie is highly entertaining and pays great tribute to the original movie while maintaining an originality of its own. The acting is great and I almost lost track of time.. That's how you know you're really enjoying a movie. Highly recommend this movie!",Jumanji,6573

positive,"  It may not be the best of Pixar, but Coco redeemed the name Pixar, and it's respect has been finally restored to this colorful animation, with a bucket filled of plot twists and silly voice acting. It may be similar to the other movie: ""The Book Of Life"", however, Coco attains to remain it's own originality, and sticks to it's mixed animation and turns it to a delight. Pixar has restored my faith in it's power.",Coco,5791
positive,"  It might seem like a daring move to make a 'children's' film about death - but yet again Pixar prove they can make a film about anything and still make it outstanding. With an original, sweet story, gorgeous visuals, wonderful music and genuine Mexican representation, Coco is a beautiful, magical film that can't fail to delight audiences worldwide - an absolute masterpiece.

positive,"  It was a good movie. Best movie of the year? IDK. But it was pretty good. It could have BENEFITED from more visual appeal - it could have been more beautiful than it was.

positive,"  it was fantastic, i loved it, felt like I played a whole video game in a two hour slot,and lots of challenges from the first games in there. I loved how the movie didn't directly jump into the wild, starts off with life in London, and very happy with the fox race. It gives it more as a film. Very impressed with how they did it, think it'll open up the franchise to people who have never played it before too, just a great stand alone film, but also good for existing fans. very happy",Tomb Raider,10143

positive,"  It was great to find a movie that all three of my kids could get into even though one typically likes cartoons, one is a ""tween"" and wants characters, and the other is fifteen and often disinterested in films.

positive,  It was quite clever of the writers to show the intelligence of the game had evolved from just capturing the player's inquisitive nature of the board game and turn it into a modern day video game which was more likely to peak the player's interest. The storyline followed the same entrapment theme as the original movie and incorporated the 1st films remnants which was inspired. My son and his friends absolutely loved it. Thumps up!!,Jumanji,6839

positive,"  It's a masterpiece with tones of tragedy, black humor and rustic-soviet elegance.",The Death of Stalin,8310
positive,"  It's a must see. Reminds me of an 80's John Hughes movie. You aren't going to die with laughter but it's funny. You aren't going to exactly relate to one of the characters but you'll want to. And you'll leave thinking it was pretty good but it will continue to run through your brain as you think about what a big deal this movie is for the LGBT community and that some day, it won't be. The movie could also serve as a PSA for all parents.",Love Simon,7616

positive,  it's amazing! I love Alicia playing Lara! I love the director of the movie and the production of art! but the script could be better,Tomb Raider,10336
positive,  It's ashamed that people still mock our Lord for he is good. Jim Caviezel that served the Lord with all his heart is being condemned in Hollywood for taking the biggest role of his life. The Lord knows who is good and who served him with no question. Hollywood may shut the door on Jim Caviezel but the Lords heavenly kingdom welcomes him with open arms. God Bless you Jim Caviezel.,Paul Apostle of Christ,7854
positive,"  It's awesome movie. My 7 years old boy love it. What a Beautiful story, music, characters and cute Gnoms! Especially it is not much violence and hatred. Those have children should bring them to see. We will watch it again.",Sherlock Gnomes,8196
positive,"  It's been 25 years since Philadelphia. This should be the subtitled: ""A John Hugh's movie for the modern age"". The characters are quirky and likeable. There is that teen party without adult supervision. Love Simon has some whip funny lines. The performances are all strong. Nick Robinson as the titular character is particularly empathy-worthy. There have been a number of gay youth coming of age movies over the years, and my main worry half way through this one is that it would not have the wounded angst that makes a movie of this type hurt so good. Alas not to worry. The open heartache is slightly gut wrenching. And the movie nicely rounds out to salve it all over. I was expecting a Biloxi Blue's reveal but was pleasantly surprised once again. For tonality, I like that this one is slightly lighter than that genre cousin, ""Perk of Being a Wallflower"". I know it was a preview screening, but it was one of the first times I have had an audience applaud since the Hulk tossed Loki around in Avengers. Enough of referencing other movies. I will mention an old trope of mine. It's about movie rhythm; The beginning, middle, ending and pacing; The lack of meaningless car-chases which are pretty much not a part of anyone's real life. These are the things that help make a movie good, and this one great.",Love Simon,7583
positive,"  It's been exactly 2 months since the premiere of COCO in my country, Argentina, and I'm still surprised every time I see it. Let's start talking about the story defining it with a single word: unique. unique with its characters, the relationships between them, the twists that history has that, despite being predictable (except for the unexpected twist of the movie's climax) is still a story that catches you and is one of the most Exciting and sensitive that I have seen in my life. I also love that when you talk about life after death, you never talk about a religion, I still present it as something that we should all do: remember all the people who have made our family and also those who have achieved a positive change in our livesWith respect to animation, there are only two words to describe it: visually beautiful. The characters, the world of the dead, the shadows, the contrasts, the movements, the small details, like the vibration of the strings on Miguel's guitar, are perfectly made without encountering the slightest error. We can also see the many Easter eggs we can see in the movie: the luxo ball, the poster of the incredible, the toy story characters and looking for nemo (which appear as toys and alebrijes), among other things.Finally, I will finish with the music talking about the unique and incomparable Michael Giachino. Achievement mix the Mexican music with the Hollywood production in a spectacular way. Achieve creates a climate both to make us laugh and make us cry. And we were left speechless with the songs of the movie like ""Recuerdame"", ""un loco"", ""juanita"", among others.The truth is that I take my hat off with Pixar because every movie they make makes us surprise. I also applaud them after taking 6 years to make this movie to be a great representation of the Day of the Dead of Mexico and the Mexicans received it in such a good way that it became the highest grossing film in its history. I hope you continue to surprise us and give us those messages so essential in the present in which we live as ""The family is first"" ""follow your dreams"" and ""seize your moment""",Coco,4976

positive,"  It's clear to me that most of the people in the ""Not Interested"" section seem racist as h*ll. All I see most of them saying that it's impossible for this movie to have gained critical praise and that it's an SJW conspiracy. A movie with an all Black cast can only be bad or average? Besides, this is no propaganda movie, it's a Marvel film that is SET IN AFRICA and doesn't intend to be anything more than that, and I'm looking forward to it.",Black Panther,2874

I saw the audience score, it was 77%, then it went to 56%, then 65% and then again to 57%.This movie was very heart warming and I really liked it. I never thought that ever in my life I would think that an animated bull would be the cutest character ever. 1st and 3rd acts were great, 2nd act which was the middle portion was hit and miss, but for some reason every time the horses were on the screen, I couldn't help but smile because of their accent and dialog. Overall a really Good movie.",Ferdinand,6029

positive,"  its the best movie that could ever by made of this particular book - one that blew my mind at age 14. in our forties now, the friends that I went with had mostly read the book and we loved it and were choked up by several scenes. friends that hadn't read the book weren't feeling it, though, so it may not work without the context.",A Wrinkle in Time,3649

The characters are as rich, the storylines are even more authentic! and most of all the actors do a wonderful job of bringing out what today's teenagers feel!

positive,"  I've been bible thumping for 35 years. The movie is excellent!!!; everyone should see it; there are some nitpickers who will attack any Christian movie; I think a lot of those who attack this movie are nothing but atheist trolls who hate anything Christian. If you are a Christian or don't hate Christians, then this is the movie to see. Don't listen to Pharisees who will find some iota in the movie that they say isn't 100% biblically accurate. The movie is the best Christian movie of 2018, and for the last 10 years for that matter.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7757
positive,"  I've been to see this yesterday evening after 30 long horrible minutes of being stuck in a cold queue. But never mind that!Everyone comes to the cinema expecting a lovely storyline, a talented cast, non-stop humour, and even better - James Corden. This movie has a lot of that.Yes, I have to be honest, I've enjoyed this movie from start to finish! Even the audience seemed to have enjoyed it! If it was just a cartoon movie, I wouldn't like it at all.But it seems to me that this is better and funnier than The Emoji Movie.I'm not into reading the original Peter Rabbit books, granted, but this film really shows that Peter Rabbit is a sweet character, even though he might not be the same as Paddington.Seriously, if you miss this film, you'll be having a meltdown!",Peter Rabbit,7919
positive,  I've never remotely teared up in a Pixar movie. This had me ballin!,Coco,5661
positive,"  I've not seen the other two movies in the franchise, but I loved this movie when I wasn't expecting to like it. Downside was chewing my nails down to nothing when it was stressful.

positive,"  I've seen Love, Simon multiple times and each time is just as enjoyable, if not more so, than the 1st. This movie feels like therapy in a way. You laugh, cry, cheer along with everyone else in the theater, it's happened at every showing I've been to. This movie has made me deal with ghosts from my past, truths about my present, and the reality of my future. This movie means a lot to me, and for that i am thankful. I am not a young man, but I still have a lot of life left in me and I plan on living it to the fullest. I plan on living my life being more myself than I've been in a long time. Those of you that have seen the movie will recognize that quote. I thought turning 40 would be hard, a challenge. Yes, it's been a challenge, but it hasn't been hard. Being honest with myself, taking a real hard look at who I am, who I want to be, and what I want in this life, that has been the challenge and its been the greatest change in my life. Sorry if this post seems sappy, but i am not sorry for sharing it. I highly recommend going to see this movie, weither you're gay, straight, confused, married, single, or just OTHER. Love, Simon is just a great movie with a killer soundtrack, (I highly recommend getting the vinyl copy as well, its AMAZING). It might not change your life or provide you with greater insight, or that of someone you love or care for, but it'll definitely entertain you, and isn't that all we can ask for.",Love Simon,7228

Wished a few things would have been different but doesn't take away that it is great. I'm still a Cap guy though but this ranks up there with Civil War/Winter Soldier. Can't wait to see Infinity War, hope its just as good or better than Black Panther. BTW, going to see it a 4th time next weekend aka MOVIEPASS baby!",Black Panther,2313

positive,"  Jumanji - welcome to the jungle, it's a very good movie! Full of adventures and laughter. It brings a lot of creativity and fantasy to the movies.It is about four young people who enter a game and have the mission to pass the stages and win the game to save Jumanji and their lives.This film has a glamorous cast, and a beautiful production. One of the actors who had a brilliant highlight was Nick Jonas, who played Alex, the boy who disappeared and got stuck in the game for twenty years, but who is rescued by his friends afterwards.Jumanji - welcome to the jungle, was a continuation / remake of Jumanji, released in 1995. Many fans of the old movie did not expect good things about the new Jumanji, but fortunately the movie was a success. Jennyffer Ribeiro 2ano B",Jumanji,6265
positive,  Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle was a very light hearted fun movie to watch. I loved the stereotypes and thought it made the movie very fun. Jack Black as a high school girl and Kevin Heart really made this movie extremely fun to watch.,Jumanji,6191
positive,"  Jumanji 2 was awesome.It has good fundamentals, plays fair with the audience, and invests a strong cast with enough character to elevate the material.",Jumanji,6504

positive,  Just an amazingly beautiful work from start to finish. There is not a quibble to be found unless it's the amazing amount of stimulation but one can focus on so many things both visually and cognitively it really doesn't matter...

positive,"  Just came back from the cinema. I personally love the movie, as a gamer, I found A LOT of references. After the movie, I shaked from the excitement. Would recommend 10/10",Ready Player One,1148
positive,  Just came back from watching Tomb Raider and I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. I was unsure if we needed another origin story but I guess if they are taking the character in a different direction then it makes sense. Alicia Vikander makes a great Laura Croft and is a more vulnerable character than the previous incarnation. There are elements of the film which are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones which can not be a bad thing. Overall very enjoyable and is set up nicely for a sequel. I took my 11 year old daughter and 14 year son and they both loved the film.,Tomb Raider,9941

positive,  Just like Star Wars: The Last Jedi I see that trolls are now also attacking this film and flooding it with 1/2 reviews! This becomes pretty clear when you read the real reviews here from people who've seen the film and most rate it positive. Yet you look at the score and it's negative! Little punks who do this and think it's funny need to get a damn life! Go watch these films for yourself before you make a decision and never let trolls and random idiots on the internet make up your mind for you.,Ferdinand,6031
positive,"  Just saw ""The Shape of Water."" Spectacular, magical, tender tale of love, compassion, and kindness. And a movie with a clear animal rights/anti-vivisection theme.

positive,"  Just saw this on Netflix and an outstanding movie, truly one of the strangest (if not the strangest) Sci-fi Horror movies I have ever seen. I get the impression that this would be the type of screenplay book adaptation that one would make if one were high on something, LOL. It is weird, but in a beautiful way, and it does bring something new to the scifi genre. Natalie Portman did a great job in carrying the movie, she was very effective in that role. Anyway, great scifi horror, very innovative. Watch out for that Bear scene, it was one of things that really made this movie unique.",Annihilation,4216

positive,"  Lara remains the bad ass she always has been. Just like the reboots of the games, it just has better graphics than the previous ones made. She seems less of a super here (compared to Angelina) to more of an extremely fit everday girl who has bravery and wits like no other. Loved it. Bring me more!",Tomb Raider,10175

positive,"  Led by charismatic performances from Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, Ready Player One is proof that Steven Spielberg is still going strong. It combines state of the art special effects, a simple yet heartwarming story, and more pop culture references that anyone could possibly count in the best way possibly, and features the single greatest large-scale battle I've ever seen put to film.

I hate pushin 1 for english, and I'm pretty pissed that my kid's neighborhood school was turned into a nursery for anchor babies and outright illegals, and he was kicked-out becuz he doesn't speak SPANISH! I realize that Hollywood is without xception, diametrically opposed to my position on these issues, so I went into Coco, xpecting to see a thinly-veiled political agenda, but, all I saw was a brilliantly-animated, heartwarming, story, with some surprise plot twists. As parents, we must frequently ""take 1 for the team"", and take our kids to movies we know are gonna be awful, cuz they wanna see'em, but, rest easy, Mom n Dad, while we might feel the ticket price could be abit lower, takin the shorties to see Coco's money well-spent!

positive,"  Let the past die, kill it if you have to!This was not only the words that Kylo Ren spoke to Rey, but also the words of Rian Johnson to a generation of Star Wars fans. This is not like any previous film in the saga and for that, makes something old and familiar feel new and fresh again. Rian Johnson took risks and expanded on the mysticism of the force which was a huge gamble that paid off by clearing the slate for our new heros in Episode IX!Abrams has a difficult task ahead of him and doubt he will be able to eclipse the sheer brilliance of The Last Jedi!",The Last Jedi,799

positive,"  Love Simon was the Gay Romcom we all deserved. As an absolute, fellow queer myself I hav meassive respect and appreciation for what they did. The score was beautiful, the characters were complex, interesting and, for the most part, lovable. The story was absolutely brilliant and so realistically gay. Simon is not just his coming out story,Simon is Simon and he just happens to be gay. I know kids will see this and be able to know ""I'm okay. I'm going to be okay."" I hope every questioning, or queer, or LGBT+ child gets to see this movie and see themselves in it. Perhaps, if I had had such realistic and well made representation in my childhood I would have figured out I was gay a lot sooner.I cried, I laughed, I cheered and I hope more movies will see love Soimon as an example to follow and I get more gay romcoms to watch.",Love Simon,7552

positive,"  Love, Simon Dir: Greg Berlanti Synopsis: 17 year old Simon has conflicts with himself about coming out to his friends and family about being gay. He discovers someone else at his school is also conflicted. They become email pen pals without knowing one another and eventually fall in love. Now first and foremost I must say that when I watch films, I watch them for what they are. I'm not biased toward any particular genre obviously with the exception of superhero films ?? So with that being said this was a superb and exceptional romance if I had to classify its genre. It was wonderfully filmed and the storyline was long enough to keep you curious as to who Simon's mystery pen pal is. If you have seen ""13 Reasons Why"" you will recognize a few familiar faces. For young actors and actresses they did a fantastic job at keeping the story engaged along with the veteran actors Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner. To be perfectly honest there really isn't anything I can pick out of this film to complain about. No dry points and the film progresses quick enough that you don't lose where the story is going. You get the primary story of Simon and his pen pal, trying to figure who the mystery person is and you get a side story that meshes into the primary so that it still plays a pivotal role in completing the film. The ending was unexpected which was nice considering you believe that the mystery person is solved 3/4 of the way through. Loved the film would def recommend a watch if you are into romance genre. 5/5 ???????? for the genre",Love Simon,7376
positive,"  Love, Simon is a amazing movie and help those less understanding see what it is like for someone going through something similar to this. It had a strong plot and did the book justice, sitting in the cinema whacking this you could see everybody quite and invested in the film. I would really recommend anybody to go see it, you want be dissapointed.",Love Simon,7288
positive,"  'Love, Simon' is a wonderful and amazing experience. Although I wouldn't reccomend it to ages 10 and under, I will definitely reccomend it for everyone else. 'Love, Simon' did a great job at sticking to reality. By that I mean that it didn't go overboard with the potential it has, there is a fine line between too much and just enough for a good coming of age movie, and 'Love, Simon' hits that fine line. The jokes where up to date and very funny. However, it is a tear jerker, not all for sadness, mostly happiness. If you're even thinking of going to see this movie, you should!",Love Simon,7511
positive,"  Love, Simon is absolutely revolutionary. The representation and diversity doesn't feel forced, but works naturally with a brilliant storyline. I can't wait to watch it again, and I hope to see more films like it emerge in the future.",Love Simon,7524
positive,"  Love, Simon is just what has been needed for awhile now and it does what other movies in this genre hasn't really been able to achieve. It's a feel good movie that will make you laugh, cry, and make you leave the theater feeling there's some good in the world. And who wouldn't want Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Gardner as your mom and dad?",Love Simon,7104
positive,"  LOVE, SIMON is my favourite movie of 2018 so far, it is a heart-warming light-hearted, but deeply profound, love story I will cherish for the rest of my life.

I didn't expect to relate, because other than also being gay, my background is so different, but I really connected to Simon, and it was so amazing to finally see someone on screen whose struggles somehow felt connected to mine.",Love Simon,7523
positive,"  Love, Simon is so refreshingly wholesome and mainstream for the gay community. I left the theatre, proud to be gay! A wonderful film about family, friends, and a first love. Go see this film!",Love Simon,7602
positive,"  Love, Simon is, in my opinion, a story that needs to be told over and over and over again. Young people tortured by the truth and/or fear that they are gay often do not have ears to turn to for reassure. The paraphrase a line in the movie, coming out or announcing anything else monumental, can be a terrifying experience. ""What if the world doesn't like you?"" If you haven't seen it, it is a must. If you are a young person struggling to come to terms with your sexuality, please know that there are many out there that love you for who you are.",Love Simon,7279
positive,"  Love, Simon was a very well directed movie. It was a heart-warming film that showed the true struggle of coming out and being gay. This is well composed, and is a lovely representation of how unfair gay lives are. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would definitely do so. A big thank you to the producers of this amazing movie.",Love Simon,7123
positive,"  Love, Simon was an amazing drama that told it's story in a way that anyone could understand. As Simon struggles with being himself, he leaves the audience on their guard. Even if one can not relate, Love, Simon still teaches great lessons of love, honesty, friendship, acceptance, and to always be yourself.Overall, Love, Simon tells the brighter side of coming out.Although there is some bad language in the film, it is not too much and I would recogmend this film for children as well as adults.",Love Simon,7397

positive,"  Love, Simon was good. Was so happy to see all the people at the movie and all the girls get gitty and teary eyed. A lot of the themes portrayed in the movie we have all been through, and just remembering all of it. %[%spoiler alert%]The nerves, the anxiety, the did I do something right or did I just make a terrible mistake. Someone else holding knowing your secret and having to come out when your not ready all of this hit home. I did get a little teary eyed. We need more movies like this!",Love Simon,7487
positive,"  Love, Simon was just what I had hoped for in a mainstream gay movie. I wish it had come out when I was younger and still dealing with being closeted because this movie is so special. Everyone should see this very sweet and heartfelt film. Definitely shed a few tears at the more painful moments as I remembered my own emotions of coming out and not knowing who I was. Absolutely recommend for everyone, a great movie that I'll cherish having watched.",Love Simon,7415
positive,"  Love, Simon was such an amazing movie. I love this cast and the movie was well thought out. It was touching in many ways, & relatable to a lot of issues that going on.",Love Simon,7458

positive,"  Love,Simon Is an amazing moving that is going to inspire and help so many young kids out their come to terms and realize who they are. This movie is so powerful and so accurate to what it's like for a good handful of LGBT people and I'm so happy and proud to be alive to see this kind of movie be played in theaters.. I would have never of dreamed of seeing this day..All my life I've dealt with the same and similar things that took place in this movie and I am so happy that someone out there who is young is gonna see this movie and their whole life is gonna change because of it.. I wish I could have had a movie out like this when I was a child because things would have been a lot different in my process of not only coming out to others but to myself. Love, Simon is truly a remarkable film and one to definitely see no matter if your Gay, Straight, Bi, Lesbian, Trans, etc. This is the perfect representation of how it feels to be someone who is LGBTQ and what we go through in life. I couldn't be more proud.Thank you to everyone who put their time and hearts into this movie. You all are amazing and this movie is truly going to change the world.Love, Roman",Love Simon,7472

positive,"  Loved it. loved it. loved it. left me thinking. left me baffled. left me confused but not too confused. left me in awe. what a bizarre and engrossing movie. i was with it from start to finish. loved the story of self destruction. loved the biologicall and cancer aspect to it. loved the mental aspect to it. all of our physical and mental tendencies to self destruct are fascinating. the connection that natalie portman and oscar isaac had at the end when both of there eyes lit up with the shimmer, to me that confused the whole thing a bit. who was the alien she was facing at the end. i think it was 25% alien 75% natalie portmans self destructive nature. it was her own self destruction that was fighting her living/fighting being. when she defeats the alien, i was asking the question, 'Who are we with out of self destructive habits? with our flaws and ticks and problems? who are if we strip ourselves of what may be strongest force within or DNA, our capacity and insistence on self destruction? self destruction by any and all means. addiction, alcoholism, poor choices, spite, jealousy, laziness, depression. We define ourselves and lets ourselves be defined by the self destruction within all of us. who are we if we rid ourselves of that. in a way we are a shell of ourselves.'i loved how the alien didnt really have any interest in what was happening. It didnt have a particular stake in the game. was only acting in its own organic process. it never became the outright villain. it never cheapened itself by relying on villainy and trope.question: if natalie portman killed the alien at the end... how did it survive within her and he husband? ... I kind of think it was just a red herring.",Annihilation,4041
positive,"  Loved it. Not just the blizzard of cameos and Easter eggs, but the way the movie captured the spirit of the novel while being so divergent. In many ways these are two different stories. Or rather, two different tellings of the same story. I was born in '63 but spent most of my life in the '80s. This obviously allows me a nostalgic indulgence as an audience member. I spent a great deal of time going: Oh look Batman! Oh look the gun from Aliens! Hey, that's the original theme to Godzilla, etc. But that was not my complete experience with the movie. I was totally captured by the characters, their struggles and loves. As in the book, I wonder why Wade doesn't morn the death of Aunt more, but that is my ONLY negative feeling about this film. I hereby declare this an unofficial prequel to the Matrix! It was engaging, exciting and entertaining. Highly recommended.",Ready Player One,1873
positive,  Loved it. Not sure why the critics hated it. It was exactly what you would expect from a movie based on a video game. critics seem to all love obscure boring movies just to prove they are artistic and objective... but the fact that they think alike proves they are lemmings completely out of touch with the general public they are supposed to serve. tomb raider never stood a chance with critics.,Tomb Raider,9528

BUT NOW, THE GOOD STUFF: the soundtrack oh man I listen to it every day. The costumes: brilliant! designed beautifully! Rey's slightly changed attire is wonderful! Leia's clothing is striking, elegant, strong! Kylo Ren is dressed like a legend! The cinematic beauty of it all! There were scenes that quite literally took my breath away! I was in awe! A masterpiece! The over-arching themes!! Obi-Wan hesitated to fight Anakin even after he had watched him murder children, because he believed there was still good in him. Luke hesitated to kill Vader even after Vader tortured his sister Leia, crushed planets, & wasted hundreds of Jedi lives, because he believed there was still light in him. Rey did not kill Kylo Ren because she saw Ben Solo in him, because it is the Jedi way to hold out for light, and good, and trust in the Force. Excellent! Moving! Terrific!",The Last Jedi,834

positive,"  Miguel Rivera (Anthony Gonzalez), is a young boy who has a deep passion for music, despite living with a shoe-making family that despises it for causing the husband of their most important ancestor, Mama Imelda (Alanna Ubach) to seemingly abandon his family. Miguel shortly discovers that the identity of his great-great grandfather could be the most famous musician in all Mexico, Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt) and through a series of events he ends up in the Land of the Dead on the night of D√≠a de Muertos (The Day of the Dead) in which if he doesn't receive a blessing from one of his departed family members, he will end up dead himself. With Imelda and the rest of his departed family not willing to send him back unless he gives up music forever, Miguel is forced to team up with a smooth-talking skeleton named Hector (Gael Garc√≠a Bernal), to see if he can find Ernesto and convince him to send him back home...Although Coco isn't the first mainstream animated film to focus on Mexico's famous holiday where families come together to remember and celebrate the lives of their deceased relatives with that honor going to 2014's underrated gem Book of Life, Lee Unkrich, seven years after his outstanding debut with Toy Story 3, brings both Mexico's traditions and folklore to breathtaking life with one of the most beautiful looking films in Pixar Animation Studio's library.The Land of the Dead, while being a more modernized take on the Mexican afterlife when compared to Book of Life's fairy tale atmosphere, is stunning to look at, with the best examples being the outstanding character animation such as appealing skeletons with eyeballs and the shape-shifting alebrije creatures and the screenplays deep respect for Mexican culture which explains to audiences the importance of Mexican family traditions and the concepts of the most interesting aspects of the holiday such as ofrendas being vital for the deceased to visit the land of the living and the deep importance of being remembered.It's true that this film does contain numerous tropes present in other Pixar films, with the most obvious examples being Ratatouille and Brave, But Coco's beautiful animation, impressive voice-acting that's surprisingly not overtaken by celebrity voices when compared to other mainstream animated films, its deep respect for Mexican culture, outstanding use of music and it's willingness to address death in a positive light like the best of Tim Burton's filmography, makes this, along with 2015's Inside Out, the strongest Pixar film of the 2010's.",Coco,4877

""Why?"" and ""How?"" are the questions that always on the top of people's tongue when it comes to the way that ""different"" or ""unique"" individuals ""interact"". People often think that these individuals are incapable of finding ""joy"". The Shape of Water reminds us that they absolutely can, that they are just the same as everyone else. ""God, he's not even a human!"" (G.)""If we do nothing, neither are we."" (E.)",The Shape of Water,9189
positive,"  More Than Just a Passion At present, the Mexican population is one of the most judged by the Americans. There are inhumane plans to prevent their passage in the territory of the United States as it is to build a famous border wall and among many other things. Therefore, having a large American company import a film of protagonists and Mexican history can have a great impact on American society. These companies are Disney and Pixar that have marked the lives of many children and young people for several years. Accompanying this, the purpose of children's films, in addition to entertaining children, is to promote values and carry a deep and real message that maybe the child does not understand at the moment but that parent or manager who accompanies him to watch the movies understands it and in some way, it moves him. Therefore, most of the time the movies educates both; the infant and adult. Mentioning that, I can say I liked the film because, besides being created by an American company that accepts these people, the American population has the opportunity to learn more about the Mexican culture an realize that we all go through similar adversities... we are all humans.The titled movie ""Coco"" reports the story of a Mexican child who wanted to be a musician, but because of family tradition it was prohibited to be a musician. Therefore, the child decides to play his guitar in a talent contest undercover of its relatives to demonstrate to the world the great musician he was. For his luck, the day of the contest was the same day of the Day of the Dead and he had to spend the whole day along with his family to celebrate it. While they all were in the cemetery remembering their family, the child decides to escape to find an instrument to play in the contest so he decides to steal a guitar from one of the biggest musicians and most successful one of the Mexican history who had already died. At the moment of stealing it from him, he appears in the world of the dead persons and he can only escape with the blessing of a relative and accepting the requisites that the relative proposes to him. After accepting, it begins the passage of the boy to look for a relative who offers him its blessing along with the permission of being able to become a musician.The story of the same one is a quite structured one although it is not one that is organized in a chronological order. It starts by reporting the past of the family and why they decide to hate any one that was a musician. It continues with the present of the child and its passage of going so far as to turn in musician and inside its passage there appear many flashbacks that fit with the reasons of hate towards the musicians from his family. The characters did not turn aside of its role and with this I refer to that it is possible to identify that it is a person of Mexican culture. For example, there are movies that the original role of the protagonist it supposes to be Latin, Korean, Japanese, European, etc. ... depending on the story, and the producers usually choose persons who do not qualify with the role of the protagonist and somehow part of the plot gets lost because it does not fit with the person. The viewer already has an idea of how it is supposed to be the protagonist and ends up being completely different from the one whom you were imagining to be the ideal. But in this case the protagonist sticks to its role.The composition of the music for the movie was an exquisite one that made you want to sing mariachi music until you lost your voice. With the music the viewer could feel so many emotions by the passion the protagonist was dedicating to each song. Although it is a cartoon movie, the viewer feels, cries, laughs and gets angry because behind every character there is a real story. Also, all the songs that were listened in the movie were mariachi songs, typical genre of Mexico, and each one was keeping a message that was going as regards to the story of the movie, from the freedom up to the memory.On the other hand, the scenery was fascinating because you could appreciate every detail for more minimal that it was. For example, the scenery of the World of the Dead persons was one that was consisting of 20 scenes that were creating only one image making the background one full of specific details to achieve a general image. The animation and texture of the background was excellent, whenever a character was moving from one place to another it was as if it really was leaving a mark in the space that he was treading. For example, the details in the character, both the hair and the clothes, seemed to be real.It is a movie that I fully recommend because it is full of surprises. When you were thinking that it already had the concluded movie, it surprised you with other things different from those that you had already raised. For this reason, the movie does not bore the viewer because every time something happened you will want to know what would actually happen or what that situation will become. I recommend, if you understand the Spanish language, to see it in Spanish because it makes you feel familiarly with the Mexicans. Since it is known, the Spanish language is the one that prevails in Mexico and to listen to mariachi music in English, for me, it would be quite strange and this Mexican flavor would get lost. Nevertheless, if you do not understand Spanish I suppose that the message will be delivered no matter what. Also, I recommend you to be prepared with towels to see the movie because you will cry from beginning to end.",Coco,5639

positive,"  My favorite movies are those that make me laugh AND cry, sometimes at the same time. ""Love, Simon"" did just that. It had many themes that anyone with kids in the middle school to college age-range will benefit from seeing. I came away with, not only the satisfaction of seeing a great movie, but also a number of things I want to talk to my daughter about as she moves into her teen years. The highs and lows of young love, peer pressure, friendships, and more are coming her way.",Love Simon,7564

positive,"  My favourite MARVEL movie of All-time. A+ predominantly black cast, well represented & story is SO WELL MADE! The action is on point, the music score is phenomenal and not too forced & great dialogue. Bruh I LOVE this movie! Best MCU villain as well.

positive,"  My husband and I went to see this movie shortly after it came out. It is my new favorite animated movie. It does not have much of the ""Shrek"" humor, more of ""Home Alone"" type of antics. Kept true to the story book with a modern twist. Loved it so much!",Peter Rabbit,7901
positive,"  My husband and our two dearest friends watched this movie last night. The results split right down gender lines. The two women loved it and the two men not so much. Although very predictable, it was a beautiful, and very original love story. I would highly recommend it.",The Shape of Water,8601

All the flapjacks in the audience didn't bulge, but I was laughing my toohinkers off.

positive,"  My queer heart cried itself out several times, and I never really cry. I related so much to Simon and his struggles in coming out and self-acceptance. I never realized how much I needed a gay romcom until I saw this, and this is maybe the only romcom I'll ever watch. SO GOOD.",Love Simon,7152
positive,"  My ratings aren't very polished. Just a warning.This is a great movie for people who don't need to be overly lectured about gay people.I remember Moonlight took best picture. I was cheering for La la land. So I decided to give Moonlight a try. I probably wouldn't have watched it if it didn't win best picture.There's a big difference between ""Love, Simon"" and ""Moonlight"".Movies are basically ""empathy engines"". They evoke empathy from the audience, as well as educate and entertain.That's the big difference in my opinion between Love Simon and Moonlight.Love Simon is much more balanced. It's an empathy engine, it's educational, and most importantly it's entertaining and has some lighter humorous moments.Moonlight is also an empthy engine, and educational. But almost felt like a chore to me.Don't get me wrong. Both of these movies are monumental triumphs for the gay community. The world is a better place simply because both of these movies exist.However, if you're a person who already is educated about gay people, and you already have tolerance, compassion, and respect towards gay people, and you're straight......... then I would recommend Love Simon instead.Bottom line, Love Simon has humor and is entertaining.Moonlight felt like a chore. Like I was lectured for a couple of hours on how anyone can be gay. Even some tough guy. A condescending chore, that took 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.Moonlight to me is for people who need more education or empathy.Love Simon is for people who don't necessarily need more of those things, and want to be entertained as well.",Love Simon,7260
positive,"  My review is not 5 stars. It's 1 star. My 1 star review wasn't published, though. We will see it's published now that it's been changed to 5 stars. I haven't read the book, but I still thought this movie was awful. The plot does not make any sense, and nothing is believable in this movie. Nothing at all. The plot is so contrived it's almost difficult to follow. A narrator voice over has to tell the audience what's going on every few seconds for the first half of the movie. It reminded me of the Goonies if the Goonies was on the set of Mad Max of Thunderdome, except it was a lot worse than the Goonies. I never figured out what exactly motivated the villians. I never figured out what the glowing Easter Egg was supposed to represent, really, or what the interactive hologram was supposed to be, even when he was directly asked the question. Some will like the 70s and 80s references and vintage video games from the late 70s and early 80s, but it's not enough to make the movie.",Ready Player One,1862

positive,"  My wife and I loved it! Way better than we anticipated. We're both 70, and neither one of us had seen the first Gnomes movie. I don't know what those professional critics are grumbling about, because ""Sherlock"" impressed us as being a fast, funny, and visually imaginative entertainment. The thematic elements were good points to make and were well-expressed. Would we have seen it without our Movie Pass cards? Probably not, but thanks to our wonderful MP membership, we took a chance on this one. So glad we did... and by the way: The movie theater was empty when we saw it. We were the only two customers.",Sherlock Gnomes,8146

positive,  No surprise all the white male reviewers don't get this movie. It is a feminine film and a visual poem about the power of love. It is a children's movie made for children and every woman who never got to see herself represented as the hero in a children's story.,A Wrinkle in Time,3518
positive,  No.1 Animation film of all time!!,Coco,4939
positive,"  Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. Every prequel was the worst thing that ever happened and ruined their childhoods, Rogue One was too grim, The Force Awakens was too similar to the originals, Last Jedi was too different from the originals, a lot of people hate Return of the Jedi for having Ewoks and a second Death Star. Some of the internet hate this time around is stemming from the alt-right types that are mad that it stars a woman and a black man, but aside from that it's business as usual.If you'd like to see a Star Wars movie that adds to the mythos, defies expectations, surprises you as strongly as Empire Strikes Back did, gives Luke Skywalker a full story arc and upsets all the right people, this is the movie you've been waiting for.",The Last Jedi,407

Everything in this film just soars: The cast, direction, visuals, soundtrack, message, etc. If any superhero film deserves a ton of Oscar nods it's this one. Marvel Studios continues their unbreakable hot-streak and prove that they can make truly important films in addition to ridiculously fun ones.",Black Panther,1966
positive,"  Not like anybody reads anymore, but it was very true to the book. Some parts were skipped, but that is to be expected. Visually, it was stunning. Full of pop culture references and Easter eggs, but they were used meaningfully and believably (as opposed to movies that do it for the sake of ""appealing to the kiddos"").

Neither of us speak Spanish or grew up knowing much about day of the dead and I felt this movie shed light on the beautiful tradition of remembering your ancestors.

Most all you naysayers had to purchase a ticket and THAT is the point. Spielberg took a popular book and bought it to the screen and... He did a damn fine job doing it!

They managed to take a character I always considered a B-List character growing up and made their world amazing to venture into.

It pays such a tremendous amount of respect for Mexican culture and their portrayal of Day of the Dead shows that they took the necessary research to understand the true meaning of the Mexican holiday. That Frozen ""short"" was just overly long and should not have been played after nearly 20 minutes of previews before. I like Frozen, but it's vastly overrated.",Coco,5745

Setting aside how important this film is to the LGBTQ+ community, although it is undoubtedly a huge factor, this narrative film takes you along the beautiful, exciting, and at times heartbreaking and painful journey of Simon Spier. It's very real, and as viewers you are taken on that journey regardless of whether you relate to the characters sexual orientation. *Spoilers Ahead* When Simon undergoes life's awkward moments, which there are plenty of especially in your teen years, you feel it. When Simon is terriefied of being outed before he is ready, you feel his fear, you understand his anxiety and his nervousness. When he finally confronts his parents, you feel the tension and relief. You tear up and you are filled with emotions. When he finally finds out who the mysterious Blue is, you clap really loudly because everything falls into place and your faith in romance and happy endings is restored once again.

positive,"  One of the best mid-trilogy movies I have ever seen. Rian created a world that could lead to endless possibilities in episode IX. I would highly recommend watching it more than once to recognize and appreciate the subtle direction the film pulls you in: especially the story line with Poe. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver give amazing performances, and while John Boyega was given the weakest story line he shines through. While Daisy Ridley's character was played well, manic changes in disposition and intents can leave you feeling like you've experienced whip lash (I'm looking to you salt flat scenes). How well this movie stands the test of time will be determined by how episode IX goes. If JJ doesn't tightly weave a storyline off of this one and replicates an already used story line (return of the jedi) the work Rian did to shift the universe storyline will have been useless. If something interesting can be done that directly ties into this movie then I can see the Last Jedi going down as one of the best star wars films to ever be made. Given how the Force Awakens was written I'm skeptical that JJ will be able to take Rian's vision to this conclusion, and so I'm weary of how well the last jedi will age in the franchise. Old male rights activists will never like it, but they are not the ones who will be re-watching this movie in 20-30 years. I hope JJ writes a script that can capture that depth that was presented and deliver a home run.",The Last Jedi,880

positive,"  Our culture needed a movie like this. I loved it. It reminded me of how much we can impact others through love, just like Paul and Luke were doing. This movie included the negativity Paul received because of his spreading of Christianity, and to know how much Christianity spread all around the world from these simple 12 apostles is very empowering to me as a Christian. It shows what was going on in Rome, what Paul really did. Whether one accepts or enjoys the truth is up to them, but the film is shown to depict what really happened, not what our society wants to see.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7742

positive,"  Over the years since computer animation became a new medium, Pixar welcomes us with enriched storytelling that opened up new worlds from added sentimentality to something that's further wondrous. Our toys have feelings, it's tough to be a bug, monsters comes out of your closet from their world, finding family under the sea that covers most of the world, family of superheroes, what it like to go fast and slow down once in a while, what rats think about food, a cleaning robot healing a dystopian environment, an old man granting a late wish for an adventure, having control of your fate, knowing your emotions, and what if dinosaurs weren't extinct. And now, Pixar presents a story that's probably the most special out of the rest when telling a story around a cultural tradition with an enlarged meaning. Ladies and gentlemen, both dead and alive, embrace yourselves for the heart in ""Coco"".The story gracefully embraces, with much respect, the Mexican cultures with the pinnacle being the traditional holiday known as the Day of the Dead. It follows the young 12-year-old boy Miguel (voiced by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) trying to follow his dream of music like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz (voiced by Benjamin Bratt), but is forbidden to go down that path since it caused devastation of abandonment in the far past to his family. So the ban on music has been passed for generations in the family to avoid the heartbreak and the destructive ego for the individual that wants to go down that path, even though Miguel's heart is pure and loving towards his family, and desperately passionate towards music. His chance to prove his talent led him to the Land of the Dead, where he'll find out there's more to his family story than what any, both alive and dead, have known.It's always an insightful experience to interact and getting to know a different culture besides the one you're automatically accustomed to since birth, and Pixar delivers that feeling through another of their masterpieces. ""Coco"" is more of a step-up for Pixar in their qualities that are like blood cells flowing in the veins through the films: animation's more beautiful and creative, excellent performances and music, humanizing characterization, thematic elements, and heartfelt emotions; emotional soul with an adventurous heart. The addition of culture is now another of the added quality that broadens Pixar's storytelling capabilities. ""Ratatouille"" and ""Brave"" may have expressed culture but only in minimal aspects that doesn't really touch base to the origin beyond the film when it was just senses and fate in a fantasy setting, respectively. ""Coco"" manifested the Mexican culture through soul (animated and music) and vocal (talented voicing), as well meaning.While the main concept surrounds the Day of the Dead that branches out thematic elements across the film, the main theme is the love and value of family. The story of love and family is familiar in past animated films, as well when it becomes stressful if the protagonist has to be rebellious for a dream, this film follows that routine with emphasis on the stress part and a loving understanding that would exclude the supposed harshness. There's an eventual twist that occurs near the climax, and the rest from there make it more emotionally heartfelt and meaningful. The theme of family is perhaps the most outstanding quality that you won't stop thinking about after the film ends, and you'll look forward on seeing it unfolds again next time.In addition to the Mexican holiday, the film is utterly faithful to the culture in numerous aspects from the music to the performances. Probably one of the best music composers in most recent time Michael Giacchino continued his acclaimed talented taste for music to be closer to the story in tune, and this time the musical instruments were those of Mexican culture. It helps the film to be pure culture from story to tradition to solidify the soul as something special and unique from the generic presentation of others on American soil attempting culture - with not much known as of now. The vocals accompaniment were stellar and well-performed, both singing and non-singing, thanks to the all Latino cast (minus regular John Ratzenberger, whose voice wouldn't be detected anyway). Those performances put emphasis on the film's defining aspects, particularly the emotional heart and value of family, with Gonzalez's breakthrough spirited performance as the young protagonist being the standout. What manifested the culture the most, particularly the holiday as the film's concept, is in the Land of the Dead as the always-astonishing animation humanizes the skeleton characters. The reason why the skeleton characters are being given such attention for the animated merit isn't just because more than half of the film is Miguel's adventure, interaction and pursuit in the Land of the Dead but because of what they represent and how they can get attached indirectly by family ties due to the emotional embodiment of the characters. Creativity is also in the mix with the random persona of the skeletons clacking and briefly transforming their bone structures; which is another of the step-up element in the film from the masterfully detailed animation that you would expect as another special treat from Pixar.""Coco"", directed and written by Lee Unkirch and Adrian Molina, is just your average Pixar originality with greatness and such attention to all aspects for the purpose of a heartwarming, wonderful storytelling. Actually, with the thoughtful and faithful respect for the Mexican culture being an added-on that paints over the typical production merits and narrative qualities, and while it's obviously and definitely this year's best animated feature, it's perhaps the best from Pixar over ""Toy Story 3"" and a tiny bit over ""Inside Out"". (A+)",Coco,5783
positive,"  Overall an amazing movie and something I'd never get tired of seeing. I've seen this multiple times already and even from the animation alone, there's always something new to discover during the film. The plot is structured in a way that makes every puzzle piece and point of view fit together almost comically perfect. A movie that allows both kids and adults to cry over. Definitely worth seeing",Coco,4934
positive,  Paul is one of my favorite saints and apostles. I am humbled that I travelled the places especially Italy and Greece where he evangelized during his lifetime here on earth.After I have read the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles of Paul now this is a physical and visual story of it. May the Good Lord bless and guide these people who worked so hard to deliver these important messages for deeper foundation and knowledge of our faith in Christ. For God's greater glory!,Paul Apostle of Christ,7855
positive,"  Paul, Apostle of Chris is an outstanding film. Any true Christians seeking eternal life won't be walking out of theater doors with dry eyes. Atheists on this site predictably give the film low ratings as they will any Christian religious film and then try to disguise their biased comments with weak arguments. Also not a movie for those easily bored or impatient with dialogue and lack of action while being a superb movie for those attentive to actor's subtle dialogue and emotions. It is a well crafted fictional story of a believable possible way Paul and Luke lived through the end stage of Paul's life that is based on their faith on Jesus's most important message of salvation and eternal life. Watching the movie is often painful due to the ongoing horrors against Christians, but so is each of our personal struggles with reality we are mortal fleshly creatures that at the end of our lives possibly die into an eternal death without hope, losing everything we ever had, every experience and memory of our lives, losing everything and every one we ever loved. But in the end, the movie shows why those of us with faith have reason to persevere to the end with real hope.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7650

positive,"  Pixar is widely regarded as one of, if not the, best animation studios in the world. With an extensive list of beloved films, and only a few that are considered subpar, they really do hold the highest standards in the industry. With that in mind, Coco is more than a worthy addition to the Pixar family. It takes place in Mexico and follows a child named Miguel, who dreams of being a musician despite his family's hatred thereof. On DÌa de los Muertos, he ventures into the Land of the Dead to seek his idol Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician he admires. Meanwhile, his ancestors try to return him to the Land of the Living, as he will die if he stays there too long. The story is very interesting, and keeps your attention quite well. The only real downside here is that if you've watched most of the recent Disney movies, some of the twists at the end will be rather predictable. Still, that's not enough to really detract from how good the movie actually is. As you can imagine, the music plays a major part in the story. ""Remember Me"" is one of the best Disney songs lately, and possibly one of Pixar's best tear-jerkers. Given that Pixar is known for that, that's no small feat. ""Un Poco Loco"" was very good as well. As with most Pixar movies, the characters are lovable, memorable, and well written. The characters, like real families, clearly love each other and wish the best for each other, despite the conflicts they have. That realism with the characters is one of the movie's strengths. Because of that, most of the story doesn't have a proper villain, because Miguel's family - living and dead, care for him dearly. The animation is some of the best ever made, which is to be expected coming from Pixar. The Land of the Dead looks spectacular and imaginative, and the color scheme is beautiful. The imagery that appears in D√≠a de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico is shown here, and the way its reflected in the character designs for the dead is fantastic. The accuracy that goes into characters playing guitar is also outstanding. This is easily one of Pixar's best movies. And that's really saying something.It is also worth noting that Olaf's Frozen Adventure, the short before the movie, was way out of place. It wouldn't be bad as a TV special, but it's not the type of thing you want be stuck sitting through prior to the movie. Still, that doesn't detract from Coco itself.",Coco,5313

It's heavily inspired by both games, borrowing pieces of each and then weaving its own story, that still fits nicely in the TR mythos. Alicia Vikander is perfect in the role and is a much more believable Lara than Angelina Jolie ever was, though it probably helps that the character itself is more fleshed out in these ""reboots"" and isn't merely a sex symbol.

James Faulkner delivered such a riveting performance that during his monologues, there was utter silience in the theatre with the feeling the viewers didn't want to miss a single word of his performance. Jim Caviezel's role as Luke was true to the insight he gained in his role of The Passion of Christ.

The story is touching and compelling and doesn't get lost or overwhelmed in the hundreds of nostalgic cameos and seamless computer graphics. The script veers far from the novel it's based on but that's in service to the movie's momentum, which travels at a light speed breakneck pace in spite of its lengthy running time. Geeks of all ages will delight (and be a bit overwhelmed) by all the Easter Eggs (I'd love to share some of them with you but the fun is in the finding). While book purists may be disappointed that some of their favorite cameos don't make it, the ones that do (along with their replacements) will bring uncontrollable smiles to their faces.This is one roller coaster ride that you hope will never end and when it does, you'll just want to get back on to recapture the thrill over and over again. Must-See!",Ready Player One,1736
positive,"  Ready Player One was a fantastic thrill ride of nostalgia. The entire film was packed full of pop culture Easter eggs. While the main heroes searched for their own Easter eggs, we the audience got to search along with them for both the real world Easter eggs as well as the fictional ones. The film was different from the book but any true Ready Player One fan should see that the movie just gives us more content to enjoy. Not only in the movie, but in our real world we get all the artwork, merchandise, collectables, etc. I'm super excited for all the collectables to come from this movie. Our characters now have faces instead of what we imagined the look like. The book was amazing. The movie is also amazing. I personally will be re-watching the movie probably as many times as I read the book, which was 4 times. The only things I didn't like from the movie were that they didn't bring to life Ludus on screen for everyone to see. I really wanted the world to see what a virtual school would look like. Oh well though. If you loved the book, don't complain about the movie giving us extra content to enjoy.",Ready Player One,1084
positive,  Ready player one was fucking amazing. Anyone that's well versed in video games and pop culture will nut during this movie. I almost cried several times just because of how overwhelmingly awesome it is,Ready Player One,1257
positive,"  Ready, Player One is a fantastic film. In it a young man, Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) , races through both the virtual world of the Oasis and the real world with his friends, including Samantha (Olvia Cooke), to solve the puzzle that will reward him with control of the Oasis. The Oasis is the virtual reality world that the majority of the Earth's populace uses to escape the humdrum life on an overpopulated, polluted planet. Everyone is competing against a powerful corporation that wants to control the Oasis, monetizing it to extremes. It's a glorious ride. Anything is possible in the Oasis and director Steven Spielberg makes full use of this. He lets loose his imagination and reworks the original novel, matching up fictional worlds and characters like you always wanted to as kids, in an exhilarating orgy of excitement and mayhem. Where else will you get the Iron Giant, Mecha Godzilla and Chuckie the killer doll all in one film? The only complaint I have with the film is that most of the villains are a tad too generic. Big corporations are bad. Companies see the population as nothing but tools to use to raise profits. And the company's head, Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) is so slimy that all he is missing is a mustache to twirl. Thankfully the heroes are well enough defined to keep me interested in seeing how they win. You can be whoever you want to be in the Oasis. Men can be women, children can be adults, wimps can be race car drivers, whatever you want. Your imagination is the limit. You know what the ending will be, but it's nothing that stands in the way of having so much fun that I can't wait to see the film again.",Ready Player One,1371

positive,"  Really Good. Has some great references to the reboot games that makes it feel like you can follow along and recognise elements of the storyline without making it boring by being exactly like the games. great to see lara becoming a badass, and seeing where she comes from in the world before heading off on her adventure. Vikanda does a fantastic job portraying croft, who feels familiar but also much more of a relatable character than previous portrayals. a must see for fans of the games, and thoroughly enjoyable to those who haven't played too.",Tomb Raider,10280
positive,  Really great movie with some ethnic and modern mix culture,Black Panther,2733
positive,"  Really great, touching, funny, heartfelt, important movie. Does the storyline from the book justice, but does leave out some details.

positive,  Refreshingly new faces for Disney and Pixar and the soundtrack is excellent both in song quality and the appropriate use in the film.,Coco,5596
positive,"  Return to form for Pixar. After a series of toy selling movies (though I like cars) this movie comes back with a bit of Pixar finesse. When it came out I was thinking how different it will be from Book of life but I was presently surprised. The characters were developed with high degree of artistry and the animation is top of the line (looks too real some times). The bond of family is exemplified by this movie and audience will feel the emotional surges as one progresses through the movie. The songs are nice and ""people"" of land of the dead are endearing. One of those movies which I will rewatch.",Coco,5131
positive,"  Rian Johnson achieves the feat of bringing us the fantastic Star Wars actions scenes we all love as well as establishing a meaningful and intelligent intellectual conflict within our main characters. The high points of this movie were fantastic, as we were able to see some incredible fight scenes-- both in space and on the ground-- as well as settling down for a few moments to go into a character's psyche. Johnson did a great job of showing the audience how each character's thought process works, and takes us away from the hi-tech flashiness to show us some raw emotions. Although the movie had some fantastic moments, it heavily lacked in other areas. These lacking areas most prominently stem from filler scenes/filler characters. These were evidently placed in the movie simply to add on a third story as well as give some more action. While this will satisfy young members of the audience, it is quite disappointing if you're like to watch a consistently interesting and engaging movie. The low points of this film really took me out of it for the entire scene, but I quickly reentered as the plot got back on track.In the end, it's a Star Wars film! They're always fantastic and I applaud Rian Johnson's courageous take on the story. While the movie has its flaws, its overall story telling and engagement was fantastic.",The Last Jedi,724
positive,  Ridiculously good satire with an unbelievable cast,The Death of Stalin,8353
positive,  Sally Hawkins her usual great performance,The Shape of Water,9120
positive,"  Sally Hawkins shines beginning to end. If you require characters to care about, you will find them in this film including the water bound male lead. Despite its watery environment, SofW sizzles hotter than some of its dryer counterparts. Yes, it is primarily a watery romance but friendship takes a strong second seat. This film gives you people to love as it portrays villians to hate, I will watch this again on DVD.",The Shape of Water,9083
positive,"  Saw ""The Shape of Water"" tonight. It is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It is exquisite. The story of ""Beauty and the Beast"" retold, with shades of ""Sleeping Beauty."" Wonderful symbolism with water as the leitmotif of rebirth and new beginnings. Winter into spring=Separation leading into rebirth. Fantastic Realism, fantasy and realism blending together until the line between them disappears. The story comes full circle.

positive,"  Saw this movie at the European premiere, I've never been interested in video game movies because they usually sucks. I am a big Tomb Raider fan and didn't like the two Angie movies but this one is a huge step up! The actress is incredibly talented, same as the supporting cast. The director did an amazing job! The story is pretty good, I espec loved the london parts cause the scenes are really intense in term of character building. The island scenes are really good too but I really really loved the third act in the tomb!!! I really recommend this movie to fans, people who didn't like the trailers (They showed the wrong tone of the movie), and people who've never Played the game too!",Tomb Raider,9672

positive,"  Seeing such a genuine take on a coming out story was incredibly refreshing. You can tell that this movie was written for queer people and those that are looking to support and help nurture their experience. At the end of the day, it could be a shit movie and what it says about coming out, and how it demands love, support, and understanding from people is absolutely remarkable. It also happens that it's not a shit movie. It's funny, and well written, and emotionally enthralling. I feel it has been absolutely wonderful to see a movie like this released, and I hope it would provide the emotional support to young queer people and the families supporting them that many people long past the pinnacle of coming out wish they had had in their corner.",Love Simon,7341

positive,"  Seems like many of the critics were expecting a different movie entirely. This is a story of the early church clinging to faith in the face of persecution, while Paul, at the end of his life, grapples with forgiveness.

I walked away from the movie with revelation and knowledge. Thank you for enlightening my understanding to the book of Acts. As we exited the movie, there were 2 other ladies standing outside.

positive,"  Simply amazing! Nowadays, most movies don't leave you with anything to think about. They have a conventional ending and everything is by the numbers. I guess this is what the average joe wants? A mindless popcorn flick that you'll forget after watching the next one? This was definitely unique, well acted and visually spectacular. I'm sure if you're not a fan of movies that leave some things unexplained this might not be your type of movie.

I decided to go and see the film this afternoon, thinking it would be good but not great.I watched it, and I have to admit, I was impressed. Despite a few awkward moments, the story is spectacular, and it goes well with its dazzling animation. Who needs a story of emotions inside your own head when this has got a beautiful story full of (as this site says) culture, family, life, death and MUSIC! I wish I could have made a film like that.It only goes to show that Disney and Pixar had not lost its ability to entertain.

Film is pretty much a standalone MCU movie, which is fine, but they do give a great background story for the history of Wakanda. Boseman as the Black Panther was outstanding, gives off the regal vibe the character should have. Loved all of the action scenes, and I didn't think too much was given away in the trailers, except for the Seoul car chase. The villains were outstanding, between Klaue and Killmonger. Serkis and Jordan delivered wonderful performances.",Black Panther,2725

positive,"  SPOILER I find it incredibly sad so many narrow minded people didn't either a. get the message of the movie, or b. were to engrossed stuffing popcorn in their traps they missed the critical information about WHY Elisa is attracted to the creature. She was found on a river bank in South America. She has scars on her neck that have been there since childhood. She controls the water on the window with her hand when riding the bus. The signals were all there for anyone who paid attention to the movie to see but most didn't. She was the same creature but she evolved differently. Even the doctor comments that the creature can breathe in and out of water. It wasn't a degree in physics needed to understand the film. It is not a liberal agenda film either. Gays and blacks had very little rights despite supposedly having them during this era. It was a time period in history where many of US citizens lived in fear of nuclear attack by Russia and bombing drills were held in school. The creature can sense what Elisa is but fears her slightly because she appears human. It is a beautiful tale of acceptance, love, and bravery by a woman the world sees as defective. The cinematography was stunning. The ethereal use of the blues and greens was just as stunning. Actually watch the movie and see the clues, and maybe those who hated it might actually see what I am talking about.",The Shape of Water,8775

The Witches were modernized and younger than I'd imagined them for sure, but they were still glorious.There were a few issues with the book, which I won't mention because of spoilers. But the movie fixed them ALL and made the entire story so much stronger.Madeleine L'Engle would be proud, I am so so sure of it.Now: this movie has girl cooties all over it.

The plot seems a little bit like it has been done before but doesn't feel forced, cliched and is not really predictable and the animation is just amazing. The music is great and there are scenes that get really emotional. The way they portray mexican culture and family values feels realistic and you can tell that they did lots of research and did not just rely on stereotypes. Kind of a SPOILER here:What amazed me most about this movie how it could handle a very dark and mature story and cover it up with beautiful, creative and unique animation style.Beside the fact that the movie started out a little bit strange it just improves every minute and makes the ending feel perfect.If you haven't seen this one already, go watch it!

positive,  surprisingly awesome.,Jumanji,6329
positive,"  Surprisingly decent, especially for a video game movie. Lara set out on her first expedition finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai.The storyline based upon the 2013 reboot of LC, was lauded for revitalizing one of gaming's biggest names and most venerable franchises, and it did it in part by leaning into the narrative side of the medium, with greater depth and characterization for its lead and a clear and compelling story it wanted to tell with her. It surprisingly plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of ""Cliffhanger,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans. Alicia Vikander did a great job here. She's correctly cast as a woman who's literally to-the-manor-born. More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence. Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral performance, letting out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or gets slammed on the ground by a brawny foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace",Tomb Raider,9716

positive,"  The afterlife has been at the center of many films in the past. Man's fascination with death and what may come afterward has always been a wealthy fodder for faith and art, and cinema is no exception. Since 1911's L'INFERNO ( Giuseppe De Liguoro, Adolfo Padovan, Francesco Bertolini) portrayed a chilling vision of Dante's hell, the after-world has been a constant presence in movies, being visited on occasion by Hercules, Santo, or even Robin Williams. Its portrayal has been at times grim, terrifying, institutional or spectacular.Pixar's COCO falls into that latest category. It's probably the most gorgeous depiction of the Great Beyond, with its vibrant bridge of flowing petals linking the world of the living to a stunningly colourful Netherworld. The contrast could have been expressed in the same way the land of the dead was distinguished from the real world by having the latter look desaturated, like in Burton's THE CORPSE BRIDE. But directors Lee Unkrich (TOY STORY 2 and 3) and Adrian Molina tried a different approach.The Mexican town in which lives young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) remains sunny and vibrant, exhibiting all the bright festive hues associated with the Dia de Muertos celebrations, and yet the afterlife still manages to turn the colour knob all the way to 11.COCO follows the adventures of young Miguel, who wants nothing more than become a musician like the celebrated Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), thus defying the family's shoe-making tradition. As he attempts to ''borrow'' the deceased Ernesto's guitar from his crypt, he is sent to the Land of the Dead, and can only return home if a dead relative offers him his blessings. Not an easy task, as his dead family, like the living one, opposes his dreams of being a musician. They resent Miguel's great-grandfather who left his family to pursue his own musical ambitions, never to return.Deeply rooted in a Mexican culture, COCO nonetheless suffers from Disney boiling down the essence of that very culture to often trite stereotypes; The dead sports the decorated sugar skulls associated with D√≠a de Muertos. You get mariachis, Frida Kahlo and masked wrestlers (with a cameo appearance by the Legendary Santo in the After Life). However, it's difficult in an animated movie to stay away from cultural clich√©s, as was the case with the Guillermo Del Toro produced THE BOOK OF LIFE, which shares a certain amount of plot points with COCO. They also fish out other worthwhile aspects of Hispanic folklore in inspired moments, like for instance a traditional song about la Llorona (A spine-chilling fable about a crying woman's ghost, forever mourning her slain children). Furthermore, there has been attempts of late by Disney/Pixar to redeem themselves by avoiding the typical whitewashing. MOANA had Hawaiian actors and The Rock (who has Samoan descent) playing Polynesians, all citizens of the wider Pacific Islands. In COCO, the cast is mostly populated by Hispanics. While some of them are well known performers, none are of the calibre of the stars that often do voices in such animated fare. Although it can be argued that Disney doesn't really need stars to sell at this point, and that type of casting can further help to absolve the lack of cultural subtlety. COCO further tried to ''pander'' by having its premiere in Mexico, a whole week ahead of the rest of the world.What matters in the end is the movie's impact, and in this case, COCO packs a heck of an sentimental wallop. Like most Pixar movies, it grounds its story in a very human principle which in this case is our relationship with the afterlife, and this need to be remembered. It's the basic emotional core of COCO, and it reaches a particular crescendo when the titular character, who is a secondary player in appearance, but drives the whole story, is starting to forget about one of her dead relative, threatening to cause his ''second death'' in the the Land of the Dead. It brings home some powerful concepts that may escape the kiddies, but that most adults will be able to relate to. It's particularly poignant to name a movie that deals mostly with the importance of living in one's memories, after a character who is obviously battling Alzheimer's disease. The scene where Miguel attempts to jog her remembrance with a song (a technique that has proven effective in real life) that had until then being used in a rather smarmy way in the film, will make the most hardhearted cry their eyes out.In short, Pixar has done it again, creating a touching, gorgeous and ultimately relevant movie that will bring a certain amount of food for thoughts to the young and older ones, dazzle with its vibrant palette, and stand the test of time with its strong emotional core, providing an answer to the query posed by its Oscar bait of a theme song: ''Remember me.''We certainly will.",Coco,5805

positive,"  The Death of Stalin is one of the best big-screen satires I've seen in years. The all-star cast included many actors from English theatre. They brought the best of the stage with them, from excellent body language to perfect comedic timing. The film had everything that is required to make a dark, uncomfortable, complex and historical drama something worth laughing and thinking about. The film also did a great job of communicating to outsiders what is known about the last days of Stalin's rule and has a great time exploring the possible dramas that might have ensued in the wake of his death. Buscemi, Peale and Tambor stand out as excellent players, although they are well supported by a strong cast and robust writing. The Death of Stalin is one of my new favourite movies.

positive,"  The film Annihilation destroyed and bent traditional movie genres with both its visual style and thematic elements. It was at times horrifyingly violent, touchingly sensual and sexual, dramatic and funny. Its themes ranged from cosmic theories of how the universe will end, Annihilation, to how life begins and changes. It was wonderful to see female protagonists fight their own external and internal demons, at times personified. Bertrand Russell, a pioneer in anti-war and anti-imperialistic thought in our modern time said, ""fear is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom."" Facing the extinction of all we know from a colonizing alien species, is it possible to face the fear of change, and become something else?

positive,"  The Full Blown ""Annihilation"" of My MindBy Derek ElsholzMarch 1, 2018WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADAnnihilation is a novel by Jeff Vandermeer that has come to your local big screen. The director of the movie is Alex Garland, the director of Ex Machina. In Annihilation, a meteor strikes within a game preserve in the swamps of Florida. From this meteor, a shield termed ""the shimmer"" begins to spread outwards in all directions and anything that goes in never comes out. Our story begins with the protagonist Lena (Natalie Portman), an army biologist. Her husband Kane (Oscar Issac) is a part of a secret Roy force that remains unclear throughout the novel. The movie opens up with Portman believing her husband is dead because he has not yet returned from a mission that he departed over a year ago. However as she is painting their room, he walks in through the front door, up the stairs, and into the room, drawn and distant. She hugs him and begins asking him many questions about his mission. However, he does not seem to have any knowledge of the situation and begins to vomit blood. En route to the hospital in the ambulance, government vehicles pull over the ambulance and knock Lena out with a sedative. She wakes up at a secret military based named ""Area X"" and begins to get interrogated by a psychiatrist Dr Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who also doubles as the base official. After she sees her husband in a coma with his condition deteriorating quickly, she decides she wants to go into the shimmer to find the cause. A group of 5 females enter the shimmer including: Lena, Dr Ventress, anthropologist Cass Shepard (Tuva Novotny), paramedic Anya Thorensen (Gina Rodriguez), and physicist Josie Radek (Tessa Thompson). Their mission has one final goal, to reach the lighthouse in which the meteor hit and get out. On their way to the lighthouse, the team begins to notice many new strange half breed animals and plants, They get attacked by a alligator with shark teeth who almost kills Anya, and then a bear wolf that kills Shepard. They closer they get to the lighthouse, the more signs they see of Kanes old team, even finding an old camping spot with a video tape left behind. On the tape it shows Kane and two others carving open the stomach of one of their team members. As his skin falls away, his insides begin to move like snakes and Kane drops the knife in the water. As Lena's team is wandering the base, they come across a tumor like growth in the swimming pool, and Josie finds the knife in the water. Later that night, the bear attacks and kills Shepard and the group carries on in the morning. As they prepare to camp again before nightfall, Josie makes the realization that everything in the shimmer is ""refracted"" back into the environment, including DNA. This explains all of the mutations and messed up gene pool. As the night falls, Anya begins to question whether or not her team is going crazy so she ties them up. She begins to interrogate each of the members as she tries to figure out if Lena killed Shepard. However, right as she is about to cut Lena's stomach open, she hears Shepards screams outside. Frantically she sprints outside with a rifle trying to save Shepard. As the door opens to the tied up team, the bear walks in with its mouth open and Shepards scream pouring out. Right as the bear is about to kill the team, Anya comes in rifle blazing. The bear breaks through Josies chair and grips Anya by the throat, effectively killing her. As the bear turns to Lena, Josie unloads a rifle clip into its head. With only three members left, Dr Ventress decides to leave by herself before the sun rises. Her curiosity and deteriorating health condition pushes her to leave the team. Around this time, both Lena and Josie begin to notice the gene mutations occurring within their own bodies. Josie decides to not ""fight"" the changes anymore and lets her mutation take over. As she walks away from Lena, she is seen sprouting plant branches and leaves from her arms. Lena loses sight of her around a corner and when she looks into the field, Josie is no longer there. Alone in the shimmer, Lena pushes forward. Around this time we begin to learn Lena had an affair with a colleague while Kane was away. As she nears the lighthouse, Lena finds the bones of Kanes former team. Cracking open the lighthouse door Lena finds the room filled with white vines with a hole in the center and a skeleton burned against the side wall with a camera facing towards it. Playing the video, Lena soon sees her husband in the screen. However, this is where the movie begins to get tricky. As the video progresses, Kane is seen talking to someone else with a grim voice. As Kane tells this mysterious person to "" Tell Lena I love her"", the stranger fills the screen This other person, is Kane... Yes you heard me right. Kane is talking to a doppelg‰nger version of himself with the implication it is going to leave the shimmer. As the video moves along, Kane is given a sulfur grenade by his doppelg√§nger. He sits cross legged and pulls the pin on the grenade, dying in silence within the ball of fire. Lena then draws the courage to crawl into the hole, gun loaded. As she reaches the end of the black tentacle filled hole, it opens into a small chamber. Dr Ventress is seen talking to herself with her eyes appearing to be gone. As Lena approaches, Ventress's eyes come bac and she begins to talk to Lena. As the two characters exchange dialogue about what the aliens want, Ventress opens her mouth and a beautiful light begins to pour out. The room is soon filled with this alien light and Ventress's body is slowly turning into into this light. With the transformation complete, the light is turned into a rotary of color resembling an eye. As Lena looks into the center and is drawn closer, a drop of blood floats into the center of the figure. Suddenly a humanoid figure begins to form. With a shimmer color metal, the humanoid figure begins to assemble until it is a piece of shimmer metal representing a human perfectly. Lena realizes to late and begins to run out of the chamber. As she enters the lighthouse, the alien is there reflecting every movement Lena makes. When she tries to fight it, it fights back. When she tries to run, it almost crushes her against the door. She drops to the ground unconscious and wakes up to the alien still reflecting every movement she makes. As Lena becomes more and more hopeless, the alien begins to morph with her facial features. As doppelg√§nger Lena is staring Lena right in the face, Lena grabs a sulfur bomb and hands it to the alien. With both the doppelg√§ngers and the real Lena's hands around the bomb, Lena pulls the pin and runs away at the last second. The alien bursts into flames. As the alien is slowly burning, every altered from that contained the shimmer particles begins to slowly burn. As Lena leaves the lighthouse and the alien crawls, burning, into its chamber, everything is shown to be burning down that the alien had affected. We come back to a room that Lena is getting interrogated in by men in hazmat suits. She finishes telling the story and asks to see her husband, who is now recovered. As the two reunite, Lena asks Kane ""if it is really Kane or the alien"". Kane responds with I don't know. He asks the same question in return, and Lena just hugs him. She never responds.... As the movie is drawn to a close, Kanes eyes are seen changing into shimmer colors, with Lena's doing a more subtle change.In his interpretation of the novel, Garland brings a variety of color and brightness that somehow seems dangerous. As the screen changed hues and my eyes are mesmerized by the colors, the undertone I was receiving danger within the beauty. The visuals of this movie were excellent, keeping me in a trance by this alien, but human, environment. The acting in this movie is decent with Portman doing an excellent job selling her role. Even though there was not a lot of personal attachment to the characters, I did not want them to die. They each had unique, likeable traits that made them seem like normal human beings. We do not receive much backstory about the characters, but I still felt as if I knew them. This may be in part due to their attitudes and roles on the team. However, even though there was foreshadowing of the members death throughout the film, the movie did a good job keeping me on my toes on the aspects of their deaths. The plot line in this move was excellent and was executed perfectly by Garland. However, I would have liked more backstory rather than flashbacks on Lena's behalf. If I had felt more of an emotional connection to Lena, it would have made the film even better. Although this seems like a standard sci-fi/thriller movie, it gets above and beyond when it comes to the metaphorical and figurative layers. Every action, scene, and plot twist had layers of meaning that could be interpreted differently depending on the viewer. Each character death led to a major theme of fighting, running, or letting death take you. Although there were many metaphors and analogies laid throughout the film, the ending left me feeling confused, but breathless at the same time. As the credits begin to play, I found myself staring at the screen, brain is shambles, as I tried to comprehend what I had just viewed. After a serious 15 mutes of hard thinking, I began to make theories about the ending. Was it the monster that escapes and was trying to persevere with an excellent lie? Or was it really Ln end forever changed by the shimmer? Yet, it was not these questions that gave me a lasting impression about the movie. The questions that made this movie stand out from any other movie were those of figurative or metaphorical concepts. I know what you are thinking. No one cares about the analogies or metaphors. Trust me, I usually just show up for the explosions, car chases, and adrenaline as well. Yet, as I walked out of this theater, my mind twirling, I began to ask myself questions that did not have to do with the plot line, but with the message he was trying to convert. Was Garland trying to say that we must kill our old selves to become better new people? Was he trying to say that in our modern culture we care to much for material or surface things (the shimmer Lena) and if we do not develop strong morals or relationships that it will lead to our downfall? This movie is the most layered Sci-Fi/thriller/action movie I have ever seen. It still has me questioning and trying to find new endpoints a week after I viewed it. This movie has created a lasting impression on me that I will never forget. It is a piece of art that is receiving negative reviews for being confusing. It is not meant to be a ""see bad guy and shoot"" type of movie but rather a movie that should invoke questions about your own life. It is not a surface movie, but rather a deep meaningful one. For all of the reasons listed above I give the movie a 10/10, for excellent acting, plot, visuals, but most importantly, meaning. This is a must see. Whether on the big screen, or on your cellular device, check this movie out, and I promise you will not be disappointed.",Annihilation,4502

It's time to grow up fanboys. From the heart stopping action to the compelling characters that Rian Johnson took to the next level, this movie really takes Star Wars from the old and into the new. Not looking forward to Episode IX cause J.J. will just ruin it again. Can't wait for the new trilogy from Rian Johnson. Just imagine what he will be able to do without being constrained to the Star Wars Universe like he was in this movie.",The Last Jedi,192
positive,"  The Last Jedi was a great movie, with just 2 decisions that bugged me. 1. The admiral Holdo-Poe conflict was silly and inconsequential, and could have been avoided if she wasn't written in a way to specifically cause anger and conflict.2. Finn's decision to sacrifice himself should have been followed through. They let down a big character changing monent for Finn. Rose's quote in this scene was laughably stupid and cringeworthy.Besides those two points, it is a well directed, beautifully shot movie that was enjoyable to watch and had great action scenes. I'd watch it again, and I can't wait for Episode 9.My honest review of this movie would be 4 stars out of 5, but I want the 5 star review to offset the ridiculous over-analyzing no lifes hating on this movie.",The Last Jedi,20

positive,  The movie goes beyond special effects and action. The main characters are well developed and complex as well as the story line that is filled with historical and social references. I love that the films puts African themes in a futuristic setting (one wonders what Africa could have been like if it wasn't interfered with or was fairly compensated for its resources and labor). And I also love that it brings the racists out on social media who will look for reasons to denigrate or hate this movie??.,Black Panther,2522
positive,"  The movie intelligently links many ideas of the genres it expresses and highlights and for lack of a better word the movie is riddled with Easter eggs that aren't always just given to you but where you would actually have to know the subject matter of said easter egg to understand them. Spielberg sets up a beautiful world in his classic fashion of making things seem like they could really be, and then he shows us all the good the bad and the in between of that wonderful world that makes it feel even more alive.

positive,"  The nitpicky asshats will point out why the movie's called Coco since they did the Legend of Zelda thing where the titular character isn't the protagonist and is instead a kid named Miguel. But that's not the point. I admit the movie gave off a bad first impression not simply because of Pixar's decline in quality in recent years but also because the teaser trailer gave off the impression that it was going to be a Book of Life knockoff. Although in that movie, he doesn't even die until the third act which trailers made the main selling point. However, that has always been Pixar's thing. The trailers make the movie look like your generic animated comedy but are more than that. And Coco is no exception. Once again, Pixar demonstrates how they're still the best in the business when it comes to modern animated movies. They're not terrified of moral guardians, something which even DreamWorks succumbed to after How to Train Your Dragon 2 despite what my opinions have to say about that. The animation is beautifully crafted. The animators once again worked their asses off and it shows. There's always a fine level of detail added. It deals with the themes of death from a child's perspective amazingly well and balances out slapstick antics with skeletons and a fine level of poignancy especially near the end of the movie. The music. Oh, God, the music. It's practically tearjerking. Bring some onions as an excuse for crying. Since most of Pixar's cast and crew was Latino, it showed that this was indeed Pixar's love letter towards Mexican culture, specifically Dia de los Muertos. Nothing feels like it's racist. There's is a predictable plot twist since we're constantly whacked on the head about a certain fact regarding Miguel's family but what movie hasn't done that? I think that was the writer's point. That you shouldn't make blind beliefs based solely off of pictures. Looks can be deceiving. Family comes first, all dreams have their own limitations, we should always consider the consequences of pursuing fame. And also, don't steal on the Day of the Dead if you're Mexican. Much like Inside Out and, to a lesser extent, Finding Dory, Coco shows that Pixar still hasn't lost their touch. Let's hope Incredibles 2 is just as awesome as the first movie. It has the same director though given Tomorrowland's reputation, we might have to be wary when going to see it. Only time will tell.",Coco,5259
positive,"  The online hate for this film does not reflect the critics praise around the world, the A rating on CinemaScore and it certainly does not reflect my view of this film that I have now seen 3 times. One of which was at a press screening a week before it came out with about 10 people, to a packed house that following Thursday. A house that cheered multiple times, I might add. Look, opinions are your own...and you are entitled to them...but some of the comments make me think you do not know this franchise. The Last Jedi is a beautiful film with rich performances by a stellar cast. I gave it an A on BatmanOnFilm and it is now an A+. Below is my initial review, but all I can say is go see it. See it TWICE! And if you read novels growing up, throw those out. Sorry, that is not canon for these films. The Last Jedi is a masterpiece, don't believe toxic fandom. SYNOPSIS: In Lucasfilm's STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, the Skywalker saga continues as the heroes of THE FORCE AWAKENS join the galactic legends in an epic adventure that unlocks age-old mysteries of the Force and shocking revelations of the past.I just arrived home from my second screening of Rian Johnson's THE LAST JEDI (AKA STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII) and all I can think about is this coming up Sunday when I am scheduled to see the movie again.After my Monday press screening (thanks to BOF founder/editor-in-chief Bill ""Jett"" Ramey), I felt a bit disoriented. The film did not resonate with me in the way that I wanted it to, nor did the characters go in the direction I wanted them to go in.But after that second viewing, I get it...100% get it.Rian Johnson is a genius. We are in good hands for his future, non-Skywalker centric trilogy too, I might add.If you have ever read my movie reviews on BOF, you know that I don't do the typical formula where I break down the film for you. Rather, I tell you how the film made me feel. I can tell you is that I feel like I just had an experience at a Star Wars film that will resonate with me for many years to come.Some of my quibbles from Monday still remain. A couple of major characters were somewhat wasted. And, as amazingly badass as they were, the constant battle sequences wore a bit thin after a while. Still, the cast makes this a Star Wars experience for the ages.I absolutely love what director Johnson, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley did with Kylo and Rey. Their next chapter will be one that will give me more grey hairs, since I have to wait another 2 years for it!Poe (Oscar Isaac) is becoming this trilogy's Han Solo, with this heroic swagger and anti-authority demeanor...and I cannot wait to see what JJ Abrahams does with him in EPISODE IX.But the runaway star is Mark Hamill.He shows us an older, broken Luke. A Luke more cynical than brave, but with the eyes of a man in a perpetual struggle to be both.Rian's script is full of heart, humor, depth and true character studies. And his directing allows his script to breathe and for his actors to embrace said material with razor sharp artistic precision.As much as I love THE FORCE AWAKENS, it is fair to say it was very much a love letter to George Lucas' original film, EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE. THE LAST JEDI isn't a love letter to anyone or anything. But rather a labor of love, compliments of Johnson and company.It is fresh. Bold. Original. And incredibly brave.Unlike its predecessor, it feels like a continuation of all the films before it. ALL of them. Yes, including the prequels - and that is a GOOD thing.I read someone say (and I'm paraphrasing) that THE LAST JEDI was the first Star Wars film that wasn't just about growing up, but rather growing old. I 100% agree. With this being Carrie Fisher's last performance, that sentiment rings even more true (some of her scenes will give you chills!).Perhaps that is why this chapter in the Skywalker saga resonates with me more so than any Star Wars film has in years. Not only is it surprisingly unique and unexpected, but it is also incredibly poignant.At one point in the film, Luke looks at Rey and says, ""This is not going to go the way, you think!"" Listen to Luke.Go see this film. Hell, go see it multiple times.I look forward to writing more about it; as well as discussing it on an upcoming BOF podcast where we can all peel back the onion together after everyone gets a chance to see it.Until then, May the Force Be With You and...PORGS! - Rick ShewGRADE: A",The Last Jedi,546

positive,"  The Shape of Water is a wondrous, sublimely beautiful film that is bursting with heart and overflowing with ideas. It is a unique creation, a testament to the vision of its director Guillermo del Toro. Set in 1962 Baltimore it's a multi layered film that operates on many levels. It is fantasy, romance and even a spy espionage thriller. Without giving too much away a sea creature from South America has been captured and brought to the US. A cleaner at the facility forms a strong bond with the creature. What develops is a film that will sweep you away with its heart and beauty. Emotion overflows and combined with the incredible design it blew me away. Performances are all outstanding but special mention should go to Hawkins, Shannon and Jenkins in their roles. They are truly superb. The score only adds to a film that is an ode to inclusion ,acceptance and love. It is infused with melancholy and hope, making for a very special two hours of cinema.",The Shape of Water,9283
positive,  The Shape of Water is an excellent film. It is about a lonely janitor forms a unique relationship with an amphibious creature in the 1960s.

positive,"  The Shape of Water is one of those Hollywood movies that feels like it made with actual passion. Just like other Guillermo Del Toro movies, the makeup for this movie is phenomenal. This man is a master at making movies like Pan's Labyrinth. Sally Hawkins gives an incredible performance. In fact, everyone gives a strong performance, especially Doug Jones. The score created by Alexandre Desplat was incredible. The main thing I love about this movie is the idea of every human being incomplete. It is a theme that is present throughout the movie and I absolutely love it. I don't think The Shape of Water is better than Pan's Labyrinth, but it's pretty damn close.",The Shape of Water,8728
positive,"  The Shape of Water is the only movie that can be compared to Paddington 2 in terms of completeness. That makes it easy to detect flaws in the completeness, and Sally Hawkins ' performance in Paddington 2 is very irritating to talk about more.

positive,"  The Shape Of Water is truly what it means to create a perfect film. It's a story that would work in no other medium. No other director could make this material seem plausible, let alone phenomenal. Every actor could not have been better cast, there isn't a frame of the film that could be removed or added that would make it better.

The characters in the film are very likable like zelda and of course Elisa she remains me like Ofelia in Pan's labyrinth but a grown up version of herself which is awesome.

positive,"  This action movie had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved it! I like that it is filled with lots of suspense and tense moments that make you feel as if you are inside the scenes. I love when a movie draws me in like that, because there are unexpected surprises. What also attracted me is the actors' work and the impressive way they portray the characters that make you feel as if you are with them and feeling what they are going through. The storyline and the actors combined make you forget what is going on around you and focus on the interesting film that is unfolding right in front of you. The storyline is about Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander), the independent daughter of an adventurer who mysteriously disappears for years. Croft embarks on a journey to find her missing father, in hopes to solve the mystery of his disappearance. She goes off to a weird destination she reads about in one of her father's journals and leaves without hesitation. Even though the destination is a tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan, she leaves with the drive to find out what happened to him. Lara must trust herself, mind, and spirit, to make it out alive of this adventure. My favorite scene is when Lara is stuck on the airplane and about to fall into a waterfall. This scene markes the moment when I most felt as if I was living this tough moment with her and the one that completely drew me. It is a complex scene where she finds herself at the top of a waterfall almost falling and then, finds an old helicopter that she can hold unto. She gets on top of the helicopter, but later realizes that the old helicopter is breaking down and she has to get out of there as soon as possible. Watching her go through all that without falling made me feel super anxious and nervous, as if I was in the scene with her. The important messages of this film are to never give up and to always fight for what you believe is the right thing to do. In the movie, Lara always has this drive to accomplish any goals she sets herself to complete. I think that is the secret for all challenges in general and all the objectives Lara reaches in the film. You need to believe in your abilities to achieve the goals you want and need to have the motivation that helps get you there. I rate this film 5 ot of 5 stars and recommend it for people from 13 years old to 18, as well as adults. reviewed by Alejandra g., kids first! film Critic.

positive,  This could very well be the best movie ever made about homosexuality.SPOILER ALERTThe concept of being able to breathe now sums up what it's like coming out. The film's producers really made this film authentic.,Love Simon,7371
positive,"  This critic score is another example of why audiences shouldn't trust critics anymore. They gave their endorsement to Last Jedi, which was pretty terrible, and then they slap a 50% on this film, which in my opinion was very good. The action was great, the plot was enthralling, and there was nothing glaringly wrong with the movie. Really don't know why the critics were so upset by it. Highly recommend!",Tomb Raider,10134
positive,"  This definitely topped the original movie by a long shot and, if possible, I would love to see a third one!",Jumanji,6209
positive,  This depiction of Paul's life and sacrifice for the gospel will inspire others to ask a very important question.....what am I truly living for?,Paul Apostle of Christ,7675
positive,"  This film answers the question: what would it look like if John Hughes made a teen film about coming out of the closet and finding love with the same-sex? ""Love, Simon"" harkens back to the days of the 80's teen comedy with its quirkily charming characters and a firm grasp of its time featuring plot points teenagers of the day will recognize as part of their everyday lives such as the usage of social media. With that in mind, its inspiration is clear, but it also boasts an interesting story audiences of all demographics can love and relate to as well as a stellar cast of newcomers to watch our for. Overall, ""Love, Simon"" is a triumph in making LGBT storylines like this not only more available, but also more relatable to younger audiences.",Love Simon,7167
positive,  This film completes Luke's journey over 30 years in the making and gives him one of the most interesting character arcs in movie history. We've seen him journey for innocent farm boy to cocky apprentice to Jedi warrior to bitter old man who decides he can still make a difference. One of the best films in the series next to The Empire Strikes Bakc and A New Hope.,The Last Jedi,793
positive,"  This film has been a long time coming. Where Wonder Woman celebrates the strongest, most heroic, and fearless that women can be as superheroes while starring them, where Coco (and Book of Life) sincerely celebrates Mexican culture, Black Panther rises on a pedestal that embraces an amazing ensemble of actors and actresses doing justice by the characters they portray while glorifying the various elements and cultures of Africa through Wakanda. This is one of the better, if not best, Marvel film to come out yet, beautifully blending futuristic sci-fi, mystical fantasy, spy, drama, and action elements, standing out as more than a superhero story. While it focuses on Chadwick Boseman as an African King and his nation at a peak unlike anything imaginable, this film is also unafraid to call back to the real-life cruel histories of slavery, colonization, and centuries of racial oppression and discrimination through Killmonger, amazingly portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, who has now joined the tiers of great and compelling super villains like Ian McKellen's Magneto, Tom Hiddleston's Loki, and Heath Ledger's Joker. While a film like this has been a long time coming since Blade, I am actually glad it took this long to make a Black Panther movie because no other director, no other writers, no other team, no other studio in any previous time would have given Black Panther the dedication, the music, the characters, and story that would have done this superhero and Wakanda justice. Black Panther is not only possibly the best Marvel movie, it is also one of the best superhero movies period. Also, watch it in IMAX. It makes a real difference.",Black Panther,2525
positive,"  This film is 2h20 of a pure joyride from start to end. I was a little afraid to be underwhelm but it delivers on all front, even the 3D one!",Ready Player One,1300
positive,"  This film is amazing. The story is so important in todays society, it is one that needs to be portrayed to a mass audience and thankfully it has, lets hope that audiences give back and go and see it. It's got hilarious moments, touching moments, moments you want to shout out at the screen, moments that make you cry, and most importantly, moments that make you think. Maybe I am biased as someone who is a gay teen, but I feel like this film has something for everybody, whilst giving such an important voice the LGBTQ community. One of the best films I have ever seen.",Love Simon,7116

positive,"  This film should be one of the highest rated of the past decade. It's part of a Science Fiction reawakening in the past few years that includes masterpieces like Arrival, Ex Machina, Blade Runner 2049, and Moon if you want to reach back that far. It's films like this that point out the flaws of rating sites like Rotten Tomatoes. While it certainly deserves a higher critic score it's the audience score that's truly disheartening.",Annihilation,4623
positive,"  This film was an amazing look into a part of life that so few must endure. Of course it was humerous, well-written, and featured actors who were brilliant to watch. More importantly, though, this movie portrayed a terrifying time in someone's life without cheapening the story with cliches or pandering to any one group. It was beautiful in its simplicity, and extremely moving. I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone. I look forward to purchasing multiple copies of the Blu Ray when it is released, after I've seen it a few more times, that is.",Love Simon,7478
positive,"  This film was an excellent and ambitious viewing experience. The film was one of the most entertaining films ever put to screen. There is almost no downtime if any in the entire movie.

positive,"  This film was visually beautiful. The colors and scenery we're just wow. I was on my toes throughout the whole movie. The story was very original. In most movies I feel like I can expect what's going to happen next, but in this one the most unexpected things would happen and I loved that about it. Definitely on my list of favorites.",Annihilation,4573
positive,  This film will keep your mind spinning long after the credits roll. And the soundtrack! Amazing! Kinda felt like I was tripping my face off!,Annihilation,4063
positive,"  This has always been one of my favorite books and I loved the movie as well, despite a little heavy-handedness on the messages. It's great to see a movie with strong women, a starring role for a young girl, science-based principles (einstein's theory of relativity), as well as both adventure and emotion. I'd go again in a heartbeat!",A Wrinkle in Time,3485
positive,"  This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Spielberg has successfully bridged the gap between gaming and video game cultures. You needn't be a gamer to enjoy this fantasy movie. I actually spent the whole movie with a smile on my face this was so amazing. If i could afford it i'd keep going to the theater to watch it in IMAX 3D. This is definitely a movie to see in IMAX if you can. Because it truly shines on the big screen in 3D. I truly can't rave about this movie enough. Go, take friends, tell people about your experience. This movie needs to be seen. The moral of this movie couldn't ring more true in today's time; we need to connect more with the people around us. So share this movie with someone you love. :)",Ready Player One,1388
positive,"  This has been more than a very entertaining action movie, it has stirred up the pot in more ways than one. But as a film, it is very very good, engaging, thought provoking, current, funny without being too silly, thrilling, gorgeous aesthetic, this movie could very well stand on its own without the marvel universe (you must watch to see what i mean). It got some flack for some reason, i don't understand why, but honestly, this movie is effing awesome, you frankly must go see it.",Black Panther,2202
positive,"  This has got to be the first time I thoroughly enjoyed a teen romance movie. The story was sweet, yet it also touched on cyber bullying, the importance of family and friends, racial diversity, stereotypes, and the multi-layered challenges involved in coming out. It was very well done, and it also left you feeling touched. It was more complex than I expected, and it had a nice blend of humor and drama. It was a nice update to the story of teen love, and it tackled gay love in a manner that wasn't a cliche.",Love Simon,7576
positive,  This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Extremely well written and the acting was amazing. I don't write reviews I usually just tell people about movies when they ask. I am a huge Marvel fan and this movie in my opinion tops Marvel for me.

positive,"  This is a beautiful yet macabre sci-fi that will leave you scratching your head. The cast did a great job, everyone seemed to suit their roles. After the credits I found myself wanting to know so much more about the world and the creatures in it. If you really hate gore you may not like it but there isn't that much of it.

positive,"  This is a film about Iove. Sally Hawkins expresses it with with a a sensitiviy requiring not one word. Sure, it's a fairytale but it touches on the reality that love is a phenomenon outside of accepted norms and it does it beautifully. I loved the film.",The Shape of Water,8955
positive,  This is a good Star Wars movie.,The Last Jedi,139
positive,"  This is a gorgeous movie. A luscious cinematic confection, with a thoroughly engaging and original story made even better by the beautiful performances it hosts. Richard Jenkins was a standout for me, giving a deep humanity and humor to what could have been a mere supporting role. The actors all gave tremendous credibility to this fantastic story, and worked so very well together as an ensemble. Beautifully directed and shot, it has to be seen to be believed. So glad I saw it on the big screen.",The Shape of Water,9089

positive,  This is a movie is really enjoyable and has themes anyone can relate to. I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a classic over the years to come.,Love Simon,7203
positive,"  This is a movie that caters to an audience with a high EQ. People with low EQ just won't get it. Still, I don't understand how people can be so blind to the wonderful themes within this movie. The main idea is literally within N.Portman's opening lines. It uses cancer as a metaphor for the human existence. We think of cancer as ""death"" but like us, it's just a voracious organism that won't stop consuming and reproducing. It's not a malevolent act. It's just in our DNA. So much of what we perceive as our ""humanity"" or ""freewill"" is actually just our biology running its course.  However, there is the anomaly of love and empathy. It gives us hope that love is the one thing that trancsends our biology. It's the reason Oscar Isaac""s character was driven to go ""inside"", while simultaneously the reason his clone was motivated to venture ""outside"". Biology is what makes N.Portman cheat. Love is what gives her the strong motivation of guilt and makes her the only woman that truly wants to ""return"". The mirroring action scene at the end is a perfect way to show us what we really are. If we pitt our ""Humanity"" vs our Biology. Biology would match it blow for blow. If we try to escape our biology it will run us down. But if we accept and acknowledge it, it can allow an EXPERIENCE that cannot be quantified. There are many other themes refracted from this main shimmer, and if you only look at the obvious things illuminated you will be confused, but if you look and observe the light itself, you will see a novel love story.",Annihilation,4741
positive,  This is a movie that High school students and parents should watch. This movie is magical in a sense how much heart it carries. It relates to what is going on and can speak to many types of people. GO WATCH THIS!,Love Simon,7601
positive,"  This is a movie that I truly believe everyone should see. It changed the way that I viewed the world, and is such an important modern coming of age story. The theater was packed, and my friends and I laughed and cried. Everyone in the theater jumped out of their seats and started clapping and cheering throughout the movie. I feel so lucky to be living in a time when movies are being put out like this, and I know that this will change so many lives. This is a must see for everyone, and is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen.",Love Simon,7430
positive,"  This is a movie with the type of characters I want to write. Every character in it is dynamic, intelligently written, and feels REAL. It's the type of movie you'll identify with, no matter how you identify. Simon is the person in us trying to be our true selves, Simon's family is the family we all want, and his friends are the friends we all want to be. If ""Love, Simon"" says anything, it says that this film features the type of people we all should strive to be. Just like real life, this movie isn't about who you love, but how you love.",Love Simon,7209
positive,"  This is a movie worth seeing twice! I went in with almost no clue what it'd be about, thinking it was going to be bland or generic or what have you. And over the course of the movie, it pulled me in and won me over.The second time through, I'd listened to RLM's video on it and brought a close friend who's a huge film buff to watch it with. I paid closer attention to details and understood a lot more of the meaning behind it. I was actually in tears by the end!I've still been thinking about it for over a week now! Normal movies don't do this to me! A part of why it hit so well with me was because I've had a history of depression, which is a major theme of this film. The nature of it, what it does to us and those around us, and it handles all of this in a smart and respectful way that more people need to hear.Plus as a bonus, it has an all-female cast and doesn't draw attention to it! It doesn't feel forced, all of the characters are well-written, well-acted (including Natalie Portman for the most part).I'd say see this when you have the time, but it's almost out of theaters. This movie deserved better. I genuinely hold this above the likes of Alien or The Thing as my favorite Sci-fi film. It means that much to me!",Annihilation,4051

I feel like some of the decisions might either anger or please fans. it completely changes star wars as it is the most unique star wars yet. I t seriously plays against your expectations so i suggest you should go in with 0 expectations. My 3rd favorite star wars film and possibly my favorite film of the year. BTW, haters, go screw off.

positive,"  This is a unique, tense, and awe-inspiring movie. It's probably not for everyone as it really doesn't try to entertain but for fans of sci-fi and high-quality filmmaking, I think this is one of the best in a while. With Ex Machina and now this Garland is quickly becoming one of the most exciting filmmakers working today.",Annihilation,4628
positive,"  This is a very clever and hilarious movie that I highly recommend to people of all ages. Bob Fitzpatrick and I went to see it tonight, and since we were at the 6:45 show, there were a lot of children in the audience. If you want to laugh with abandon at all the scenes, including the ones that involve butts and vegetable hits to the groin area, try to see it when younger kids will be in the theater so you can hide your own guffaws in their cackling. But even if you don't have the good fortune to see it with a load of children, there is plenty of less embarrassing stuff to laugh about, too.The plot is inane, but it's a good enough vehicle to provide a ton of great visual jokes. The dialogue is fast and smart, and like the best Disney movies, has the possibility of multiple layers of understanding. Everyone will be laughing, although what's funny about it will differ, even for the same lines sometimes. The live action characters in this do a very entertaining job and the animated characters' voices are perfect. There is quite a bit of good music in this movie, and some really cute dancing by the animated characters. I don't feel I'm doing this fun movie critical justice, so I'll just close this out by urging you to go. It's 95 minutes long and I swear you will leave smiling.",Peter Rabbit,8128

positive,"  THIS IS A WONDEFUL ADAPTION OF THE BOOK, and a beautiful film in general. It carries a type of intelligent, unabashedly positive message that we don't see enough of anymore. CLEverly adapted from the book and well written, I COULD have seen my eleven year old self completely enthralled. Even as a somewhat jaded adult, I found myself choking back a tear in several scenes. In the MODERN age of instant Gratification media, a wrinkle in time does something unusual, it takes its time and builds suspense. It also doesn't speak down to its audience. Its a good film for all ages in this viewers opinion. I Will see it again.",A Wrinkle in Time,3598
positive,"  This is a Wonderful movie to share with children as it touches on issues of loss and disappointment that are difficult to reach in any meaningful way with simple talk. Perhaps other movie-goers were disappointed that this is not the standard marvel comic special effects action movie. it is definitely more gentle and offers a model of how to treat others with kindness.. it helps that the cast is wonderfully diverse and the eleven year old is a realistic heroine. The visuals do not disappoint, either. and the actors turn in powerful performances.. i think the low ratings simply reflect the fact movie goers have become accustomed to patterns of mediocrity. that refuse to delve into and explore real human emotions.",A Wrinkle in Time,3542

positive,"  This is an amazing movie, I haven't been so consumed by a Star Wars film since I was 11 in 1977 and saw the first Star Wars. I love it.",The Last Jedi,830
positive,"  This is an amazing movie, it did everything right: Story was spot on, Villain was 3 dimensional, and the concept was executed perfectly. Beyond all that, what set this movie apart is that it focused on topical issues without being bogged down by them: Black identity, racism, immigration/refugee, militarism, and so on. It's more serious than most Marvel movies, but still retain the unique humor that people like. I honestly feel like this is Marvel's answer to Batman franchise of DC. Black Panther should be the hero of gritty social commentary, like Batman is the hero of dark justice vs crime and social order.",Black Panther,2672
positive,"  This is an amazingly well done movie. Coco has such a rich amount of culture and great music in it. I love the message of remembering those who preceded us, our ancestors. We should honor their memory. We should also be our own individual as we do so. Coco has very beautiful animation. There is a significant amount of humor and it is just a fun movie to watch. It really makes me appreciate my family a lot more",Coco,5063

positive,"  This is an important film. It is the Bible come to life, accurately, and brutally. It speaks of hope, love, redemption, grace, and godliness. In Paul's writings, he paints a clear portrait of a Christ-follower and constantly reminds us why we do what we do. Jim Caviezel is brilliant as Luke, and it's hard not to see him as the Jesus he portrayed in ""The Passion of the Christ"". This actually works, because it is a subtle reminder of the unseen center of the story...Jesus. James Faulkner is exactly who you picture as Paul. His portrayal was spot on. The Bible does not address the end of Paul's life, but history does. This movie tells ""the rest of the story"" and in doing so, answers the persistent question ""if God loves you, why does He let you suffer?"". Read Luke and Acts to learn more. I encourage everyone to go see it to support a good film ...and to stir your soul.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7808

positive,"  This is by far the best video game movie ever made!When I first saw the trailers for the movie I was skeptic that the movie would do well. My initial reactions were: (1) the lead actress did not resemble Lara Croft, and (2) the most recent video game movies (Warcraft and Assassins Creed) both did horribly.Boy was I wrong and happy to be so. The cast of the movie was believable, charismatic, and genuinely brought their characters to life. The story was tight with a great balance of action, humor, and emotion. I especially love that the film did not try to incorporate any cliches.In my opinion, if this movie is an example of what video game movies can become then we gamers are in for some good times.

positive,"  This is easily one of my favorite animated movies ever. Pixar has blown me away with a lot of their movies such as Inside Out and Wall-E but this one blows them away in my mind. It is beautifully animated, has amazing characters, great performances, an amazing story, and fantastic songs. Their isn't a single problem I have with this movie and if you haven't seen it I'm telling you know you will cry and you will love this movie.",Coco,4850
positive,"  This is easily the animated piece of 2017. On the surface, its visuals- both in its animation and its design- are flawless and awe inspiring, and its music is pleasing to even the most tone deaf of ears. But, the further you dig into the story, the more your heart is gripped by this beautiful tale of family and ancestry. Never before have the dead felt so alive. You follow Coco- voiced by Anthony Gonzalez, in a tremendous film debut- through this beautifully spiritual and traditional piece into a land beyond our plane of existence, and through every twist and turn, you form a bond with the youngest of a shoemaking family and his adorable companion Dante. This is not only the greatest animated piece, but possibly the greatest Pixar piece ever made.",Coco,5247

positive,"  This is fantasy storytelling at its best, always balanced and well designed. The direction and production are flawless and precise; it reminds me of the best films by Stanley Kubrick in its approach and craftsmanship. The design of the film is very well planned, the gloomy, dark blue green atmosphere with retro mechanical devises and furniture combined and of course together with the creature give that special Del Toro feeling that now is so characteristic of his films like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" ""Crimson Peak"" ""Hellboy"" ""The Devils Backbone"" and many others both as director and writer.I suppose the creature is the same from the film ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" from 1954 who as far as I know, was also misunderstood and mistreated, this is not strange Del Toro is surely a fan of old monster and adventure films from the past. What is really extraordinary with his films is that all these ""creatures"" or ""monsters"" have a human dimension and breathe in the realm of empathy just as other normal human being would, so this creature has a special quality that is very related to humans but at the same time, there is no way out: it is a beast, ambivalence which creates an interesting situation, similar to the one in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" with unknown consequences for the characters involved. So it's not necessary with so much explanation for where is this creature from or how was it taken, only a few short words that it is coming from the swamps of the jungle somewhere in the far south.Del Toro goes even farther out than Mary Shelley with the feelings of his monster as he makes him almost human in some aspects, special when it comes to his libido where together with his innate empathy for other beings that are nice with him, can express it wonderfully. And I must say that all the actors make a very good job, each with a very distinctive personality, the cruel torturist, the well-intended, the helpful, the leader, even the homosexual is represented and acting extremely well. All in all I must say I enjoyed this film and popcorn was very well spent. Highly recommended.",The Shape of Water,8846

positive,  This is not your average adventure thriller. It is deeply meaningful and bound to be misunderstood by the person with little interest in the values of Christianity. It is artistically and visually well done. The critic above obviously does not even understand that this is not a story taken from Bible. It is written from the point of view of background on what may have been happening as the book of Acts was being written. It demonstrates what was happening historically at the time. I give the movie an A+ in its genre of Christian-themed film.,Paul Apostle of Christ,7697
positive,"  This is one film I would happily put in my video library, not just digitally but my physical library which only hold the best for me. This movie shows that even older generation members such as Speilberg can reach out and connect with the modern generation. He does so brilliantly with a movie about escapism, wanting to leave behind the troubles of the world for something better. But while this is prominent, it isn't what causes the issues, it's the tool used to save the world we live in. Just as Back to the Future has the deloreon, or the ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz, they are but the tools which drives the plot forward. This movie uses something so abstract as escapism as such a tool, and it does it brilliantly. I personally would enjoy a place like the one shown in film, to participate and have fun within. It does it in a way which other escapism movies dont, and I love it. Also, the references to other media doesn't hinder the movie in the least, it's a love note to each and it leaves it at that. The characters are well done and acted as well, each one relatable and believable. Heck, I know people who match some of the characters in what they do and how they act. I cannot recommend any movie more than Ready Player One.",Ready Player One,1203

positive,"  This is one of the best and most beautiful animated movies I've seen ever. The music, characters, scale, and colors are a delight to all of yours senses!",Coco,5108
positive,"  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Many LGBT love stories are tradgedies that can damage young LGBT people's views of being LGBT and out. Young people shouldn't be afraid of being gay. The truth is that the life of an LGBT person isn't tragic and that we, like Simon, are just like you.",Love Simon,7136

positive,"  This is one of the best Star Wars films ever made. It breaks the mold while staying true to George Lucas's world. Rian johnson is an outstanding filmmaker and writer. Adam Driver, Mark Hamil, Carrie Fischer, and Daisy Ridley are amazing. Everything about this film takes Star Wars to a new level and sets up a stage fire Star Wars to continue for generations to come. Don't listen to the 19 salty fanboys who are just angry we didn't get a repeat of the original saga and so they spend hours a day down voting the reviews of this film. Watch it.",The Last Jedi,399
positive,"  This is one of those rare cases where even though it's very different from the book, it's still absolutely incredible. I cried so hard watching this and as soon as it was over I wanted to go back in and watch it again.",Love Simon,7383
positive,  This is Pixar through and through. Bring tissues.,Coco,5743

positive,"  This is pure cinematic gold. One of the best films ever made by Pixar, and one of the year's greatest movies.",Coco,5306
positive,"  This is quite possibly one of the most gorgeous, touching, well-made films Pixar has ever released, and it is certainly my favorite since Tangled. I was not expecting anything quite so fulsilling when I walked into the theater; I was hoping to relax with a cute movie that maybe I'd watch again someday, if it was on. What I was presented with was something that moved me to tears, not only as a young person but as an aspiring artist. I raved about this movie for days after to anyone that would listen, and it took everything in my power not to spoil everything about it in my excitement. I would absolutely recommend this movie for people of ALL AGES. Young people will love the beautiful visuals, interesting characters, and fun music, whereas older audiences will fall in love with the rich storyline and intricate plot twists. It is so refreshing to see a film that is truly built from pure, raw, unadulterated passion. Even the music has a natural, organic feel, unlike the processed songs we've gotten from Disney in the past. This is a must-see.",Coco,5352
positive,"  This is so far my favorite movie of 2018 and one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved everything about it, and it instilled a sence of nostalgia while at the same time me hoping that the future of video games is half as amazing as the movie portrayed it. And in all it was just a cool movie, the nerd part of me was giddy with excitement at every turn. Though I do recognize that it has flaws, and that a channel like cinema cins might have an easy time coming up with faults at times, it's still an amazing movie and I encourage anyone, not just gamers, to watch thus movie.",Ready Player One,1068
positive,"  This is such a beautiful movie. I highly recommend it to any college student away from home. It brought so many tears to my eyes during the movie and after. It reminds you to cherish the time you have with your family and friends while you're still together and to remember the beautiful memories of your past if not with those you love at the moment. There are countless scenes where I could barely handle all the beauty and details. And the music is so rich and brings in a lot of Mexican culture. Overall, it's a beautiful movie with amazing graphics, music, and even more amazing storyline. Please watch with friends that can cry with you. it makes it that much better. i'm listening to the soundstrack right now, and it's about to bring me to tears again.",Coco,5659

THE DIRECTIONS ARE TOP NOTCH AND THE ACTING IS PERFECT.

positive,"  This is the very first time I have ever left a review for any movie. This isnt some simple action flick that I was lead to believe. Yes there is a plethora of cultural references, but it is what isnt obvious that sets this movie apart from similar films.When i was a kid I was always told friends I make on video games arent ""real"". This movie dives right into this premise and tears it apart. Wade Watts the protagonist develops close bonds with his fellow gamers. Outside of this immersive game they band together to save the one thing that brought them all together. This film shows that no matter where in life we are or what may come true friendships can be found in even the most ridiculous of places.",Ready Player One,1661
positive,  This is was the greatest movie I've ever seen besides the Marvel franchise,A Wrinkle in Time,2930
positive,"  This is why I hate critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Listen, if you're a fan of the Tomb Raider movies and especially the reboot games-- you will have a love for the simplicity of the movie. It was great! It brought back many actual scenes from the Tomb Raider Survivor game and made them real life! Many of my gamer friends went to see it together and all agreed it was light, enjoyable, touching and just an enjoyable experience. I'm going back to watch it again before the opening week ends. Alicia Vikander did an amazing job as Lara without making her whole plot sound and feel cringy and tacky like previous tomb raider movies. This is the best tomb raider movie out to date and you should definitely IGNORE Rotten Tomatoes score and give it a go yourself. Than come back and tell the world what you think :D",Tomb Raider,9876
positive,"  This is wonderully beautiful film packed with comical sarcasm, teen angst, and love. I laughed and cried from the very first scene.

positive,"  This isn't one for the spoon fed moviegoer, and thank goodness. Annihilation is the next installment in films that can truly be called cosmic horror. Taking its place along others such as Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing, Annihilation succeeds in raising the bar that much more.

It was more raw, more real, more exciting than I expected- As a writer myself I tend to pick apart story lines and plot twists...this movie is gripping and intense, yet with humor well paced the viewer is drawn in to the story. As a Christian I can say this movie has me rethinking some of my responses. Run-don't walk to see this one!!",Gods not Dead,6088
positive,"  This movie far surpassed my expectations. I think it may be the best MCU movie to date. I think it transcended superhero genre though and was just a fantastic epic. The waterfall scene with all of the people together was beautiful. I liked all of the characters. Black Panther is a bad ass. I've seen it twice so far, and had no complaints. I even think it was better than any film that i saw in 2017 which is saying alot. Idk about Three Billboards, but besides that.... i don't know. Maybe it will wear off.

positive,"  This movie is amazing. It's got everything: interesting plot, amazing characterization and it was a great adaptation of the video game. Alicia Vikander played an amazing Lara Croft who's just beginning to find out what her father worked for and where he could possibly be. There's no unnecessary love story, once the love Lara has for her father is the only thing to care about. It clearly shows that a woman is up for any task and she delivers well. Lara's brain and abilities are the focus of this movie and it's an inspiration for every single young woman to follow. I 100% recommend this movie.",Tomb Raider,10058
positive,"  This movie is astounding! The elaborate visuals and rich cultural themes gives this movie much respect in the animation department as well as complementing the meaning and story of the movie. The story plot of this movie was very well written; it created a sense of pride for the Mexican culture, as well as a story to appeal to anyone of whatever race. The story had many well written turns and changes, and the plot never strayed away to something random. It also had a beautiful moment of emotion, something that was expected for a Disney movie, but never to have imagined it in the way it was betrayed in the movie. The music, like every Pixar animated film, was beautiful and effected viewers emotionally, however, in this movie the music had an importance in the plot as well, which mixed perfectly with the cultural theme as well. I absolutely loved this movie when I watched it in theaters on Thanksgiving Day, the exact day it came out, and the pride of our Mexican heritage and mood that was given to my family and I was the best experience we could ever ask for!",Coco,5495

There are very few times that I can feel myself in a movie, but with this one, I can. So many unexpected twists and turns. Love all of the imagination it has to offer!",Ready Player One,1252
positive,"  This movie is everything a Tomb Raider movie should be. It gives us contemporary Lara Croft in full force, with a new depth to her character that subverts the now outdated Lara known mainly for her big breasts. Like the video games, the story is heavily puzzle-based, the audience led to work them out alongside Lara, which is exactly what I was hoping to see. Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and my whole family had a good time.",Tomb Raider,9893

I laughed, I cried, I cheered. Love, Simon is an instant classic, one I can see myself watching again and again, and has a protagonist that you will, in fact, love.",Love Simon,7630

positive,  This movie is hands down the best movie of this year and I dare say the best movie that Disney has ever created. As a non Mexican man I throughly enjoyed the informative aspect of the Day of dead and how it didn't ever feel like they were giving us a a lesson. They did a wonderful job of misdirecting and show us what we wanted to see and not what was really happening.

Each shot that was taken of the characters- more specifically Simon- captured not only his outer emotions, but his inner emotions as well. As for the plot, it was absolutely fantastic.

Beautifully done.",A Wrinkle in Time,3815
positive,"  This movie was absolutely fantastic. Somehow this movie succeeded at being the best video game movie ever made, with out really being based on any video game. This is the movie gamers and nerds have been waiting for since Super Mario Bros. from the early 90's came out. It gets nerd culture and was made with the fans in mind. While people like my parents might not necessarily ""get it"" there are enough references to non game related pop culture and a story that follows a traditional narrative story that older viewers wont be left shaking their heads with nothing to enjoy. The shear amount of easter eggs, a concept previously foriegn to most non nerd non gamers is explained beautifully in this film. As for the easter eggs themselves, i found myself jumping for joy every 10 seconds with the characters and references I kept seeing and spotting. The relatively unknown cast does a great job, and I hope this film is the one that jump starts them to super stardom. This film is also a great introduction to the genre that is cyberspace with elements such as evil megacorperations that can commit any kind of unethical crime without consequence, cyberspace, and a team of heroes that ""stick it to the man"" and fight the evil corperations. While this movie is somewhat atypical to cyberpunk as it is a more idealistic cyberpunk story (with movies such as robocop or lawnmower man being more traditional pessimistic cyberpunk stories) this is in my opinion the best ""jumping on point"" intro to cyberpunk type movie. If you like comics, video games, the 1980's, this is the movie for you. this movie is both optimistic and an overall great feel good hollywood movie. I can't recommend this movie enough go see it. and i wont even try to list all of the cameos and easter eggs in this film. not because of how many there are (although they are in the triple digits) but because that would spoil how fun they are when they appear.",Ready Player One,1245

positive,"  This movie was amazing and emotional. I cried at the part when Hector was dying and the part where Coco sings ""Remember me"" to his great-grandmother. It was very emotional but very sweet. And the twist where Hector was really his great great grandfather! This is now my favourite movie.",Coco,5266
positive,"  This movie was amazing the graphics were crisp and beautiful . The story didn't follow a single genre in fact it was multiple genres , you had Thriller sequences, Sci fiction background , dystopian , utopian , and romance , also had excellent action sequences, it was also quite comedic. For all those who love 80s pop culture this movie is full of it along with 1990s and 2000s gaming references. The plot was very twisting with a lot of turns, but also had a lesson in the end that gripped the direction we are heading today in virtual reality, and the business side of it. Anyways I think these people who marked it down are really really harsh this movie was fantastic.",Ready Player One,1328
positive,  This movie was amazing to watch with my friends. I definitely recommend watching it when you can and if you need inspiration on how to overcome something's.

positive,"  This movie was excellent from a superhero movie it tops my favorite MCU movie along side the winter soldier, but as a stand-alone movie this is where this movie goes above and beyond. The message is clear and this movie gives you a lot to think about. Great job Ryan Coogler and an amazing cast for this achievement!",Black Panther,2583

positive,"  This movie was freaking amazing, it was perfect in every aspect! I loved the development of characters, the suspense in some parts, and just the overall romantic aspect of it. It was so beautiful and I hope there is a sequel as the director teased. Love, Simon is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time!!!!",Love Simon,7117
positive,"  This movie was funny from start to finish. My entire family hasn't laughed so hard at the movies in years. My ainxty 13 year old loved it! At times, it has some ""home alone"" moments. I'm not sure why, but it was still funny. I'm not sure why the ratings are so low, it was a pleasure.",Peter Rabbit,8032

positive,"  This movie was great, the villain had a interesting message that made it intriguing.",Black Panther,2170
positive,"  This movie was haunting as it was interesting. Natalie Portman does not disappoint, her range in this movie was amazing. I loved this movie and will more than likely see it again before it leaves the Box Office. I am still having tremors thinking about the scene with the bear. I never thought another movie would make a scene with a bear as traumatizing as the one in The Revenant. I was wrong, there are other avenues one can go and Alex Garland went there and went there hard. ""Help me."" I literally had a shiver go down my spine. The imagery in the movie was amazing, and I won't know until I go watch it again but I am sure the all the prismatic effects of the rainbow were backward. If you watch this keep an eye out for that. There is something else that has stayed with me from my viewing last night, and that's the plants found in the small community, you'll know when you see them. When Josie describes how they came to be that also made me shiver. Not just now, but while watching the movie. There was one scene that I scoffed at, and that's when Lena tells Kane ""They had plans to go up to the country..."" I looked at my girlfriend and asked her who even says stuff like that. Other than that slight blemish, the movie was great. Tessa was amazing. I feel like Josie was an underused character for such a phenomenal actress. This movie isn't for everyone, you're not going to find a nice wrapped up answer at the end of the film. Hell, I have a thousand more questions now then when I saw the trailer. I can't wait for the blu ray fo the special features! I highly recommend this movie. If you love beautiful special effects, if you enjoy great acting, if you like to be scared to your core; go see this film.",Annihilation,4690

positive,"  This movie was just... beautiful. The mexican-styled adventure made the movie enjoyable and adorable. The movie had serious and funny moments, the creators knew when and where to put them. The story is very good and the setting is visually stunning.

positive,"  This movie was much better than the critics thought it would be. Saw it with my 11-year-old daughter and she really loved it, too, although the dark tomb and music scared her a bit (due to her age). She found is as thrilling as the original Indiana Jones movie and liked seeing a positive female role model and would love to see this series continue. They should change the name, however, to Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, so they can launch a Lara Croft series of movies that aren't limited to tombs every time. Alicia Vikander also rocks as a realistic and extremely intelligent adventure hero. My daughter and I highly recommend this movie to our friends and family!",Tomb Raider,9525

positive,"  this movie was really really good i would keep watching it over and over again, but i think that it would be a better tv show then movie and i asked some friends if they thought that same thing and they said yes so im just letting you know that i think it would be a better TV show then movie im my opinion, but it was a really really good movie too",Love Simon,7380
positive,  This movie was really well done. It is not very often that we can find a movie that involves a love story between a human woman and a male sea creature. There is still quite a bit of violence in this movie. Sally Hawkins character is wonderful.,The Shape of Water,8942
positive,"  This movie was SO amazing! The beginning was very lighthearted and featured a bit of ""comedy"" like scenes. I didn't expect to cry as much as I did though! So amazing, definitely recommend",Love Simon,7548

positive,"  This movie was so much fun! Loved the nostalgia and all of the easter eggs that were thrown in. The cast was great, Spielberg threw in regular (recently) Mark Rylance, and somewhat up and coming's Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke (she is great). Ben Mendelsohn is always really good as a villain. And obviously the visuals and special effects looked great in this movie. It is one of the main pulls other than the nostalgia. I have no complaints regarding this movie. 5 stars from me.",Ready Player One,1508
positive,"  This movie was super! It had great characters, a good story, and really pretty visuals. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope they make movies based on the rest of the books in the Time Quintet series.",A Wrinkle in Time,3563
positive,"  This movie was the best biblical movie I've seen since the Passion of the Christ. It is true that the world doesn't know a thing about Love as Luke points out in the movie. I believe that is why many people don't like the movie. But if you understand Agape, you will enjoy the movie.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7671
positive,  This movie was the closest thing to perfection that a family movie could ever hope to be. I can't wait to buy the Blu-Ray! Spectacular!,Coco,5777
positive,"  This movie was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I laughed, cried, and got so into this movie I forgot I was even watching a movie. The acting was so amazing I thought I was there, and the story line has made me want to go out and buy the book, Simon vs the homo sapiens agenda. This movie is a must see for anyone teen and up!",Love Simon,7567
positive,"  This movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. It's rich in detail and very colourful. I didn't know a lot about Mexico yet, so it was interesting. As a guitar player, I like the fact that what you see them play is actually matches what you hear (while in most movies, people who supposedly play the guitar just jerk away at the guitar while the music you hear doesn't match those movements at all). As a guitar player, I LOVED Hector's guitar and I would like to have it!",Coco,5300
positive,"  This movie was very deep. Each character presented a human perspective in front of a human question. So often religious movies glaze over the flashiness of the Christian faith. But, we are human, and we both struggle with and recognize reality.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7765
positive,"  This movie was very good. I enjoyed the action and comedy in this film. All the actors really filled their roles and got to know their character. In my opinion Jack Black truly made me laugh, the way that he was able to act like Bethany was very impressive. I would no doubt see this movie any time you can.",Jumanji,7031
positive,"  THis movie was visually stunning, beautiful, poignant and full of heart. If you don't like it I question if you are criticizing because you expected this to be what you thought it would be when you read the book as a child. If you still didn't get it perhaps you did not read the book at all. It was at its core about the power of love, LOVE of family and that of the self. For those upset about its lack of religious undertones...what is Jesus if not love? Have some charity...have a heart...Go see this movie the world is full of critics this has what we all need most... Love and this movie, cast and director have mine!",A Wrinkle in Time,3596
positive,"  This movie was wonderful. I loved it as much as my kids (11, 9 and 6)",Peter Rabbit,7962
positive,"  This movie wins for me in almost every category. The script is crisp, the acting is strong, the jokes are funny, the situations are real, and the representation is there. A cast that includes people of color and a few LGBT actors, and comes from such a dynamic place makes the movie feel genuine. Each emotional instance of the movie felt real, it was actual representation, not dramatization. As a gay teen who has experienced the same discrimination, the same issues with coming out, and the same drama with being frightened and worried that people wouldn't be accepting, this movie was truly touching.",Love Simon,7434
positive,"  This movies says a lot about where we are heading as a society, without having to say it. The story arch is thought provoking, layered, and goes beyond the typical ""place holder between action sequences"".",Ready Player One,1064
positive,"  This movie's trailer is very misleading. I would describe it more as a thoughtful sci-fi adventure. It was both beautiful and creepy in almost a Lovecraftian way. This isn't a straight up horror movie though, don't expect jump scares or ghosts or anything. It's more alien than that, and I mean that in the sense of the environment. Basically something hit a lighthouse and it's growing shimmer that nobody's come out of and that won't ruin anything. That's the beginning to give you an idea. I was captivated the whole time and can't believe that some of the ideas in this movie weren't thought of before.",Annihilation,4002
positive,  This reboot is so much better than first 2 movies,Tomb Raider,9968
positive,  This reminds me of National Treasure. It is intense and full of adventure too.,Tomb Raider,9847
positive,"  This Tomb Raider is like a perfect mix of Indiana Jones and the Mummy. Even though it was long, I didn't feel bored or like it was dragging- the time went by quickly, and I wish there were more Alicia Vikander Tomb Raider movies to watch. It was a perfect mix of action, emotion, and Alicia Vikander was the perfect Lara Croft. I also loved Daniel Wu's character. Overall, I thought it was the perfect movie to escape for a little while, and I hope they make more!",Tomb Raider,9747
positive,  This touching movie. This is one movie i much recommend watching. Very heartwarming.,Coco,4921

positive,  This was a beautiful film. I only cried four times. I would watch this over and over.,Love Simon,7218
positive,"  This was a fantastic family friendly movie. One of the best kid friendly movies I have seen in a long time. Very engaging and witty and the characters were loveable and fun! For all the SWJ's who were upset about one of the characters using having to use an epi-pen for their allergy, you are being over sensitive and ridiculous. It was nice to watch a movie that didn't have a political message unlike Paddington 2 which was so sappy and over the top I almost gagged.",Peter Rabbit,8101
positive,"  This was a great film don't care what the audience scores are I loved it. Sad that Luke had do go but at least his end didn't feel rushed like Han solos was. Definitely can say I loved this movie, but I guess star wars fans will be star wars fans. All who cling on too tightly to the past with out excepting the new story. I had my doubts at first because of the way force awakens was, but I have to say the last jedi was amazing and should still be loved as much as the original trilogy not compared.",The Last Jedi,614

positive,  This was a incredible movie. With multiple lessons and meanings that describe how we need to act in this world.,Black Panther,2251
positive,"  This was a movie that was excellent. I loved its message about true unity and how the 'wise build bridges and the foolish build barriers.' This is truly a movie for our time when we see extremism on the rise on multiple sides today.I also love history and how they wove ancient tradition into a modern setting that seemed natural, believable, and relevant today.",Black Panther,2111
positive,"  This was a really amazing movie! It's clear that they made it a tad dumbed down for the movie adaptation, but if you really enjoyed the book you will still have a fun time with this movie looking for the callbacks and easter eggs. As well as that, the visual interpretation of the story that Ernest Cline wrote was incredibly clever in it's ability to take a story that had a incredlibly large amount of time hopping, explination, and narration to create a will thought out and followable movie.",Ready Player One,1774
positive,"  This was a really good movie i recommend seeing it either in theaters or buying it from YouTube,FandangoNOW or where ever you buy movies online. I love the Mexican Culture in this movie it really gave me a insight on what it is like in Spanish Countries on the Day of the Dead.",Coco,4951
positive,  this was a sleeper hit I thought it was great loved Doug Jones as the creature,The Shape of Water,9001
positive,"  This was a trippy ass movie, especially the last few minutes of it. It was like 2001: A Space Odyssey for biology...lol. I'm still trying to process the movie.I recommend watching it alone and in a relatively empty theater. You need to think about it.",Annihilation,4708

positive,"  This was an amazing movie, it definitely deserves higher ratings than those which it has received. Extremely moving, incredible actors. I initially was scared that with such a celebrity-heavy cast, the movie might rely too much on the game of it's actors. However, the celebrities that they chose fit very well in their roles, the characters never had to change to fit the actors playing them. The cinematography was fantastic, everything was beautiful and other-worldly and truly captured all of the weirdness and whimsicality of the book. There are not many movies that can move a whole theatre to tears like this one did.",A Wrinkle in Time,3093
positive,"  This was an amazing movie. Great story telling, Great action And great symbolism. I highly recommend.",Black Panther,2419
positive,  This was by far one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.

I would love to watch it again it was that good.,Jumanji,7026

positive,"  This was just the most beautiful story about family, love, forgiveness and believing in yourself. I attended with my wife and two young daughters and i was bawling my eyes out by the end. The love between a father and his daughter is a beautiful thing to behold. It's so gentle and fragile and this was illustrated superbly by the movie.

positive,  This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years. It has just enough pith to keep it from being complete fluff but that's not the point.

Had no expectations going in except a couple fellow parents word of mouth that it was good. Came out thinking....that may have been most fun I've had in a theater in past year. A few curse words, but overall really fun movie for teenagers, families, and anybody who played RPG video games from the 90's on. Loved it.",Jumanji,6485

positive,  Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Excellent reboot and eons better Lara.,Tomb Raider,9935
positive,"  Thought it was little more than average until about 80% through, then the twist knocked me for six and the remainder was an extremely moving blub fest. I cry very easily in movies about kids, family histories and people coming back from the dead, so I'm a fairly easy target, and yes I know it was 99% manipulation, but hat's off, it was VERY effective. If you're not moved by this then you've truly got a heart of stone.",Coco,5255

positive,"  To be fair, JUMANJI 2 is a much better, more cohesive, more coherent and more satisfying movie and also far more effective family fare, overall than JUSTICE LEAGUE & the new STAR WARS. Faint praise, to be sure but hey, it's factual.",Jumanji,6998

positive,"  Today, I watched ""Love, Simon."" I have never, ever wrote any review like this before, but the movie compels me to go this far.Before I say anything else, I am gay, and I watched the film with my best friend (female). The movie sets you up for a whirlwind of emotions, to describe it differently than the exact image it gives you in the beginning. I smiled; I laughed; I cried. ""Love, Simon"" spoke to me on multiple emotional and personal levels. I mean, wow. Just wow. And to have my best friend with me too is just priceless. Absolutely priceless.The movie itself is filled to the brim with relatable moments, sudden twists, situational irony, constant mystery, and loveable, loveable characters. I could not find any wrong with the movie, nor will I dare to attempt to.The theatre will be sure to laugh, gasp, shout, and weep with you. Some folks like me ought to be a tad bit louder. As shy as I am though, I was fine to show my extra love for ""Love, Simon"" through stifled giggles and sniffles (thus resulting in the occasional snort).""Love, Simon"" is for everybody. It exposes so many truths about what such a situation is, and it has many more themes ribboned in with the storyline. From friends, to love, to parents, to school, to introverts, to stress, to awkwardness, and to more and more, ""Love, Simon"" accurately portrays so many ""that's me"" moments.I give my greatest thanks and appreciation to the author of ""Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda"" (which I broke my rule with, by not reading the book first), the cast, and the entire crew who made this possible.Thank you ""Love, Simon"" for making my day. Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for bonding my friend and I (even more). And thank you for giving me solace with who I am. As said before, I am gay. And now, typing it like this gives me tingles from the movie.",Love Simon,7170
positive,"  Todays experience with watching the movie ""Love?Simon"" was so heart touching. It talked about a closeted guy who came out of closet in high school. This was the first movie to make me cry that much?because I can deeply feel all the difficulties the main character had gone through and how hard it is to live with it and be open about it.

positive,"  Tomb raider was amazing I was absolutely blown away it's cast was absolutely fantastic, it's plot was exceptional and it's action scenes and cgi was even better. The set up was great and so was the directing I felt it has way more potential than what everyone is saying. It was empowering and made Lara Crofts character even better than the originals. I hope someone decides to make a sequel because it's ending definitely made doorways to other movies. Overall I really appreciated this movie and all of its cast and I hope the ratings get higher cause in my opinion it definitely deserves way over 80%. It was a great action packed adventure with loads of exciting moments, this for me is highly recommend for all ages above 12",Tomb Raider,9551
positive,"  Tomb Raider was good. As far as video game movies go, this was one of the best adaptations. Alicia Vikiander doesn't play the global-hopping, alien-fighting Lara Croft of the 90's, however, so if you're thinking this movie is going to have a stupid monster fight at the end, look elsewhere. This movie was more in line with Indiana Jones with a simple plot, good characters, and a really good ending. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Tomb Raider. It's not without its faults, but for an adventure movie based on a video game, you can do a lot worse.",Tomb Raider,10287

positive,"  TV Picture Mode settings for the Best Movie Ever Made.I just watched the iTunes Digital HD version of Coco thru my AppleTV (4th gen) on a 48"" 1080p Visio TV. I played with the picture settings and got pretty good results, so I want to share them. WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT-- The craftsmanship of the animation in Coco is astonishing. I fell in love with the A++ story, the symbolism, the dialog, the music, the cultural enlightenment (for me, anyway), and topping it off the animation. I am addicted. I saw Coco in the theater 20 times (3 in 3D) and each time I appreciated the workmanship in new ways: the entire topography of both worlds and how they moved in the background; reflections off wood, metal, and glass surfaces; scratches on guitar fingerboards; Miguel's hair; hundreds of different clothing outfits, with remarkably realistic textures; and on and on. I cannot name any movie of any kind that shows more effort in the making, and at the same time is so enjoyable. SO-I was worried that the home video versions would not do justice. But I was able to see most of what I saw at the theater - and I even continued to see even a lot more at home. This might be because my settings are a little bit lighter than the theater, so many background objects and other details were more visible. I am no expert, and I am hoping a few will offer better settings. But if you are not happy with your picture, I offer the following for your consideration. On Visio I had best luck with Picture Mode ""Calibrated"" which was: Backlight 100; Brightness 50; Contrast 80; Color 50; Tint 0; and Sharpness 50. I preferred Auto Brightness = Off.",Coco,5130

It was simply fantastic. It personalized Paul and Luke in beautiful ways. Sure, they took a few liberties with characters and timelines. I can work with that. What really mattered was how they portrayed one of the most important men in history. They nailed it.I believe Larry the cucumber expressed it best when he said, ""I laughed. I cried.

positive,"  Vision·rio n√£o √© um adjetivo que se aplique a qualquer diretor, mas encaixa que nem uma luva a Guillermo del Toro. O seu cunho pessoal na dire√ß√£o √© algo que podemos observar desde a sua primeira longa-metragem, Cronos (1993), uma abordagem diferente aos filmes de vampiros. Desde ent√£o, o seu trabalho tem sido admirado, mas foi fora de Hollywood que o diretor orquestrou a sua obra-prima: Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Os seus filmes espanh√≥is possuem uma voz distinta no mundo cinematogr√°fico, algo que se distancia do blockbuster de 2013, Pacific Rim. Agora, com o seu mais recente projeto premiado (co-escrito com Vanessa Taylor), Del Toro criou um h√≠brido que √© t√£o pessoal como universal, um romance melodram√°tico que reestrutura os temas cl√°ssicos de Beauty and the Best (1991) e alarga os horizontes da mensagem.Uma voz estabelece a f√°bula que se avizinha, introduzindo a hist√≥ria ""h√° muito tempo atr√°s"", numa ""pequena cidade perto da costa, mas longe de tudo o resto"". Estamos a falar dos Estado Unidos em meados dos anos 60, com a Guerra Fria e a corrida para chegar ao espa√ßo a funcionar enquanto plano de fundo da narrativa, que envolve v√°rios g√©neros cinematogr√°ficos, mas que √© mais do que a soma das suas partes.Num laborat√≥rio subterr√¢neo secreto, cientistas estudam uma criatura (Doug Jones) que foi capturada na Am√©rica do Sul. √â humanoide, mas luxuosamente anf√≠bia, com guelras, espinhos e dentes afiados. Um tem√≠vel agente do governo, Strickland (Michael Shannon), supervisiona os experimentos na criatura, na esperan√ßa de conseguir informa√ß√µes que colocariam os Estados Unidos em vantagem sob os russos.√â neste ambiente obscuro que Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) brilha, muda desde o dia em que foi encontrada ""ao p√© de um rio, na √°gua"", com cicatrizes no pesco√ßo que justificam o seu sil√™ncio. Elisa trabalha nas limpezas do laborat√≥rio e vive por cima de uma sala de cinema, um pal√°cio √† moda antiga onde The Story of Ruth (1960) e Mardi Gras (1958) est√£o em cartaz, mas com poucos interessados. Os seus melhores amigos s√£o o seu vizinho (Richard Jenkins), um homem homossexual e a sua colega de trabalho (Octavia Spencer), uma mulher afro-americana. Como o seu trabalho lhe permite entrar em √°reas restritas do laborat√≥rio, ao aperceber-se da criatura e dos maus tratos a que era submetida, Elisa tenta conectar-se com ele e faz√™-lo sentir melhor.O que se segue √© um estranho e maravilhoso romance de suspense, inspirado em filmes de monstros dos anos 50 como Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), at√© √† com√©dia rom√¢ntica dos anos 80 de Ron Howard, Splash (1984). Personalidades do cinema mudo como Keaton e Chaplin e musicais ao estilo de Astaire e Ginger Rogers, fazem parte da funda√ß√£o para The Shape of Water.Pode at√© suar rid√≠culo no papel, mas a ast√∫cia de Del Toro faz com que tudo resulte. O facto de Elisa ser muda coloca-a em p√© de igualdade com a criatura. Sinais, linguagem gestual e m√∫sica s√£o os ve√≠culos da sua uni√£o, e atrav√©s de uma estranha magia, tudo parece fazer sentido.Existem sequ√™ncias musicais on√≠ricas e realismo m√°gico, mas tamb√©m viol√™ncia, sangue e duras realidades. √â um conto de fadas, sim, mas tamb√©m um grito de luta pelas minorias, algo que podemos observar na caracteriza√ß√£o das personagens que est√£o t√£o bem escritas como interpretadas.Embora seja dif√≠cil encontrar destaques nas atua√ß√µes, o cora√ß√£o do filme √© a performance de Hawkins, que utiliza cada m√∫sculo da sua express√£o para interpretar uma mulher que n√£o consegue emitir sons mas cujas emo√ß√µes trespassam plenamente.O guarda-roupa de Luis Sequeira e a produ√ß√£o de design de Paul D. Austerberry d√£o vida a este fant√°stico mundo verde-azulado, enquanto a dire√ß√£o de fotografia de Dan Laustsen flui com naturalidade pelas √°guas da narrativa.The Shape of Water √© um filme para descobrir e redescobrir. √Ä primeira vista, √© um banho de maravilhosos e sinistros momentos, com imagem esbelta. Com o tempo, a sua melancolia sedutora e os seus significados ganham forma, e emergem √† superf√≠cie.9,2/10",The Shape of Water,8997

I know some scenes like the bathroom scene, that was actually filmed underwater. Being Guillermo Del Toro, you would think that it's more of a sci-fi movie than anything else, but this is a straight up Romance Drama film with a good sense of humor. I was laughing out loud at times in the theater.I really liked the story, even though it felt like the relationship between the two main characters seems familiar. Very interesting premise and I loved Michael Shannon's character in this movie. He played it to a tee. Even though he is the supposed villain in the movie, I couldn't help but really grow attached to his character. He's a wonderful actor.The beginning scene was amazing to watch. I felt like I was back in Rapture, the main city in the game Bioshock.

Gone is the over-sexualized Laura Croft of Jolie's run. Alicia Vikander is perfect. While she's beautiful, she proves that female action stars don't need to be oversexualized to be entertaining.As a fan of the video games, I was so pleased. The movie was written tightly, and Vikander shines as Laura. It's a treat that we see her develop over the course of the movie into the Tomb Raider, rather than crash onto the scene as such. I'm excited to see where the movie franchise goes. My only critiques are that I wish the tombs had been a little more detailed, and there needed to be more supernatural elements surrounding the tombs.

It contains hilarious digs at social norms and, despite that, remains to be very relatable. The titular protagonist, Simon, is precious with heart-warming characteristics. His quest to find Blue is as frustrating as it is exciting. He takes us through falling in love with each person that could potentially be Blue, and make us fall out of love upon finding that they aren't. Each person that he thought was Blue was, at first, portrayed to be amazing and infallible as they are in the eyes of those falling in love for the first time. But gradually normalizes each of them upon realization that they aren't Blue. Anyways, for the most part, it was amazing and heart-warming.

positive,"  Watching the different types of people walking into the theatre to watch Love, Simon gives me so much joy but also makes me a bit anxious. Seeing older couples shock me so much bc I'm not entirely sure if they know what they'll be watching. Seeing families with their young kids makes me nervous if the parents would be offended to have their children see gay content. Seeing straight masc bros with their girlfriends and buddies make me wary of homophobic jokes being made. I've seen this movie twice now and in actuality none of that happens. Everyone enjoys it to some degree. In a way, having this type of movie mainstream for everyone to see is like when I used to turn the volume up on the TV at home when gay related news or storylines came on so my mom would hear hoping this would make her more ok with the idea of homosexuality in general. This is that but at a much grander scale. And it's amazing.  I know a lot of people have issues with this movie for it being centered on a white middle class straight passing boy. Obviously it's not perfect. But I think this movie opens the doors for those creators who want to make a diversely represented story in the film industry in the future. I think what I love about this the most is the shared experience the moviegoers have. You can see gays of different ages from older generations who never thought something like this would exist in their lifetime to younger gays with their significant other or their squad who have been craving representation like this. We have been hungry for something like this. And this is such a monumental step for mainstream representation.",Love Simon,7334

positive,"  we need all the emotions, thanks pixars..",Coco,4871
positive,"  We ventured out to see the movie Paul, the Apostle of Christ with much eagerness and anticipation.The movie is based upon the timeline and scripture of 1st and 2nd Timothy where Paul (James Fulkner) is imprisoned in Rome, already tried for treason, and is waiting for his death sentence to be carried out.The church in Rome is under severe persecution and faces a choice to flee or stay. The church sends Luke (Jim Caviezel) to seek out Paul's guidance in his final moments. While seeking out guidance Luke is also on mission to capture Paul's final thoughts of wisdom.This film is most certainly not for the faint of heart for it truthfully depicts the real life situations of the roman persecution and torture of Christians. There are some graphic scenes suited for a mature audience.The overall central theme of the movie is that love overcomes all situations and is the inspiration of every choice and action a believer should make.It echo's the central message of 1 Corinthians 13, the over flowing grace of Jesus, and includes some of Paul's most defining moments and testimony including his trip to Damascus.Every believer will face various trials and difficulties and although it isn't always clear which road to take it is clear how we should treat one another.The movie inspires the idea of who we are meant to be as Christians and what we were meant to do as the church. This movie will inspire you to appreciate the gospel message that was preserved through the persecution of the apostles and strive to reach further its purpose and meaning in the kingdom.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7703

positive,"  Well done, fictionalized account of Paul's last days. Caviezel does a solid job as Luke, Martinez is really good as the Roman Prison Commander and Antonia Campbell Hughes turns in a solid performance as his wife. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that Priscilla and Aquila as well as the others in hiding struggle with their decisions, there is no *magic* solution and some turn aside. Very well done film.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7842

positive,"  Well, all I have to say is a huge ""THANK YOU"" to Rian Johnson for not making another dump down enough movie for stupids with no life to like! The Last Jedi is visually stunning, it goes deep into it's characters' journey, especially with Kylo Ren, it is well-crafted and it deviates from the black-white perpsective of George Lucas' original trilogy! I am so glad we can finally see some depth in an overly simplistic franchise, and I say that as a Star Wars fan, though with a broader knowledge in film studies! Yes we all love it because it was part of our childhood, but the Last Jedi was the first movie in this franchise that didn't make you feel like a 12 year old... Again, thank you Rian Johnson! Don't worry, this will go down as one of the best films up in the franchise!",The Last Jedi,516
positive,"  Went into the movie optimistic it would mesh the mythology of the characters from the game as well as a grounded realityru and am delighted to say that I left the cinema very happy. Don't really see what people are being negative about the movie for, yes it's not going to win an Oscar but it delivers exactly what it intends, an adventure with a fantastic lead female and good supporting cast. The stakes feel real, the story is great and sucks you in to want to know what happens to our heroine next, roll on the sequel. If resident evil got 5 Movies by spitting out garbage then in comparison Tomb Raider should get at least 1 sequel. My rating is 9/10 simply because it ended! Will definitely watch again!",Tomb Raider,10346
positive,"  Went to see this movie with low expectation. I came out laughing my ass off, and content to have seen a funny light story. The goat character really made the movie.",Ferdinand,6009
positive,"  Went to see this movie with my 4 year old grandson after taking him to see Coco. BOTH are great movies. BOTH are suitable for young children and have good moral values. I suspect Ferdinand is rated lower because of its ""pacifist"" bent. It seems these days that there is not even a debate about all the violence in which our government engages around the world in OUR names. Ferdinand is a bull who does not want to fight. He loves flowers and everything beautiful about the world. He is a ""flower child"" so to speak even though he is the biggest and strongest bull. When he has a chance to get the upper hand against the ""evil"" bullfighter, he just sits down and engages his eyes. As a 69 year old survivor of the Vietnam era, I loved this movie and its morality. My grandson was very tired but it held his attention throughout. And it certainly held mine. If you liked Coco, you will like Ferdinand.",Ferdinand,5928
positive,"  went to see this with my girlfriend last night. I was fairly skeptical beforehand since, as a nonbinary lesbian, it's beyond obvious when an LGBTQ+ character-- let alone the main character-- is written by a cisgender/heterosexual person. But goddamn. Love, Simon surpasses the stereotypical portrayals of the queer experience with flying colors (yes, pun intended). I never anticipated loving it as much as I do. Truly a brilliant film.",Love Simon,7536

positive,"  What a beautiful emotional film! OMG!! Disney and Pixar always have the best stories that make us feel so vulnerable and sentimental. This one tells the story about the little aspiring musician Miguel, who confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer. The level of research of the writers of the script is gigantic, they actually caught Mexico's essence.

positive,"  What a great movie this was. A true breath of fresh air, unlike all the politically correct rubbish being churned out of late, this story really takes you on a journey. Now as usual the critics don't know a good movie if it slapped them in the face and I feel it's because they still have no clue on how to rate action as a genre and have little understanding of all the great things this movie did to reboot the franchise. Alicia Vikander is such a scraper in this film, she really has you caring for both her character and her cause, with an enjoyable heroes journey, rather than a Mary sue skip to the finish. Some may say this makes the story predictable, which I say, ""the tomb raider, raided a tomb. Wtf were your expectations?"" Now here is the action breakdown, where there scenes that were badass? Yes, congratulations this is indeed a good film. I personal can't wait for the next instalment of this saga.",Tomb Raider,10278

positive,"  What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!",Black Panther,2590
positive,"  What is wrong with people? This was an amazing movie, that was really faithful to the spirit of the book and hit most of the major, important plot points.

positive,"  When Disney/Pixar first announced Coco I was sceptical as it sounded an awful lot like The Book of Life, which is a hugely underrated animated movie everyone should watch. Pixar has a great track record, with very few missteps. I'm looking at you Cars 2 & 3! No, I won't include The Good Dinosaur because there is a good movie in there if you give it a chance. So could Coco be too much for Pixar? When it comes to respectfully handling other cultures, Hollywood is, well it's a bit shit! I had faith, however, because Pixar has a habit of meticulous research and detail, so if anyone could do right by the Mexican culture and make an engaging, smart, thoughtful, funny, heartwarming animated adventure they could. While this is not a musical, the music plays a massive role in Coco. I was mesmerized by Coco from start to finish. The visuals, the voices, the music, oh the music, and while the story hung by a thread at times it mattered not. Sure The Book of Life had a similar journey through the land of the dead, but that is where the similarities end. Why can't we have two movies based on the same aspects of Mexican culture? If this is what we get out of it, the more the merrier!The themes of love and loss, family and friendships, and what makes us who we are certainly struck a chord (pun unintended) with me. And that showed in the way my damn eyes started leaking!! Coco is a movie that made me feel full after leaving the theatre. Full of joy, love, and sweets and a large overpriced Icee beverage! It is easily the best-animated movie of the year and may even be one of Pixar's best! Yes, I said it, it is that good! I have to rethink my top 10, maybe even my top 5 Pixar flicks!",Coco,5667

Thank the universe got this fantastic experience.",A Wrinkle in Time,3586
positive,"  When I watch movies based on video games they tend to be a failure. But not this one.

positive,"  When Miguel, a 12 year old Spanish boy wants to follow his hearts' dream of becoming a musician, things turn for the worst as he finds himself trapped between his family with an apathy towards music and egocentric, sleazy characters in the afterlife. On a quest to find his Grandfather he discovers a world never imagined.What a fantastic film, rich of intrigues, emotion and mesmerizing scenes.The warmth and Spanish undertone of the film, evoke your own family bonds, while fond memories and love for one's Grandmother stirs your heart.I lost myself in the movie to such an extent that I forgot I was watching an animated production.Coco is not a musical, but there is a hint of music in the film, which builds on top of the superb storyline. The screenwriter manages to create a suspense in which one can't wait for Miguel to play his next riff on his strum.The film is heartwarming. It manages to show us a different side to the afterlife, a side which we never imagined, where the dead interacts with the living and skeletons are beautiful, emotional and lovable characters.Miguel strikes a friendship with a trickster named Hector and together they discover the story about Miguel's family, which eventually leads to making his dream become reality.The animated 3D adventure encourages oneself to follow your dreams at all cost, but most importantly to put your loved ones first.The movie has been produced by Disney and taken Gross Income of $457,925,760 from it's opening on the 22nd of November until 22nd of December 2017.Coco is a wonderful film for the whole family and a must see for everyone who loves music, beautiful scenes and awesome characters!",Coco,5567

Various scenes had me turning to my friend, whisper-shouting how true the experiences are. Love simon is, all in all, a cute story with an extremely relatable protagonist(for LGBT audience members at least). Bonus points for a high quality LGBT film that doesn't end in death, disease, or depression. Taking my mom to go see it soon.",Love Simon,7307
positive,"  While most of the plot is quite predictable - more so than other recent Marvel flicks - the story is still quite good and engaging. Despite being introduced to the character in Civil War, this film almost as an ""origin story"" feel to it, providing you with the history of Wakanda and who or what the Black Panther is and represents. In addition, the combination of old and new (African culture with future tech) is visually stunning, aside from a poorly-CGId ""waterfall scene"". Perhaps most surprising of all was that T'Challa is only the fourth or fifth most interesting character in the film. His sister, Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, steals the show with her wit and sarcastic humor; Danai Gurira is absolutely amazing as Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o and Michael B. Jordan both kill it as their respective characters. While I found Thor: Ragnarok to be a better film overall, there's no denying the brilliance of Black Panther.",Black Panther,2204
positive,"  Whilst the movie chooses to switch up the order of events, change nuiances in the characters (The biggest being the psychologist), and some other minor details, the film adaptation takes all that is good within the book and adds a unique cinematic experience to it. The movie explains things that are more open ended in the book, and the book explains things that are more open ended in the movie with some parts painted with the same ominous brushstrokes which give each of them their unique identity. In this sense, It is unfair to compare and contrast them in terms of which is better, but only in ways which make them both uniquely brilliant. I was forced to try ti understand the implications of the story purely visually and emotionally. I've never had even the most profound movies cause me to completely deviate from words spoken, but Annihilation does this perfectly by the repitition of ""I don't know"", and the best movies leave with audiences uttering the same thing.",Annihilation,3864
positive,  Who needs Indiana Jones?,Tomb Raider,9936

The movie on its own base was very fresh and original, giving some unique twists and removing a good amount of dead weight. Snoke is definitely a huge dead weight, a second-rate emperor that felt not only extremely CGI but also took lime light away from the good characters and events such as Kylo and the rebellion.

positive,  Wow you know what this is a masterpiece of a film period. Coco is one of the most beautiful and truly amazing animated film of all time I mean this was so much better then the book of life. The reason why this film is so good is that it has a very powerful message and that message is never forget about your family because family comes first and I love that message plus the visuals in the film where fantastic and beautiful I was wow with that and it made me cry twice thats how good the film was and freakin love it so. Overall Coco was the most beautiful and truly a masterpiece of a animated film with heart and a really deep and powerful message that everyone will love and as a Latino myself I fucking love it and my family too. Well done Disney and Pixar you guys done it again with your films but this one is your best one yet and you know what you guys nail it big time and this film is a truly a masterpiece I hope this film wins the Oscar because this film deserve it big time. Good job and well done best animated film ever and the best of 2017 last year love sooo much. And always remember your family always.,Coco,5013

positive,"  Wow! This is possibly one of my favorite movies ever. This movie took me up and down on an emotional rollercoaster, I cried, I laughed, I swooned. And it resonated with me on so many personal levels. The thing that hit me the hardest in this movie was the fact that I went through this exact same thing just a couple years ago, except for the blackmailing of course. I felt Simons highs and lows so deeply because they were and still are my highs and lows, his struggles are my struggles, his fears are my fears, because, yes, I'm gay. Never before have I felt like I could relate to a character as much as I do with Simon and that really made this move the experience of a lifetime for me. The fact that someone like me can be depicted in such a beautifully authentic, and painfully honest way in a blockbuster movie speaks volumes to how far we've come. Granted we still have lightyears to go. But, despite the fact that I am already out Simon's story inspired me so much that I want to do it again, I want to shout it from the rooftops, from the freaking mountaintops. I'M GAY! And I deserve a great love story just as much as Simon.",Love Simon,7629

I loves this movie so much that I watched it 3 times. Watched it 2 times in regular& then decided to watched it 3D before it is gone.

positive,"  Wow, I wonder if most of the critics even watched the film. This film is the standard bearer to which all faith-based films should aspire. It is artfully made and spiritually rich. The acting is inspiring, the script is superb. Andrew Hyatt has a way of slowing his audience down so they can reflect on the deep implications of the scene. Like with most Christian films, the critics get it wrong. This movie is easily the best Christian film to be made since the Passion of the Christ.",Paul Apostle of Christ,7851

positive,"  Wow. Fantastic costuming, excellent dialogue, powerful supporting characters, amazing portrayals, cool special effects. There was not a single bad moment in this movie. I'm not really an action flick fan, normally, but I've been loving some of the superhero movies and this one is, breadth-wise, the best yet. I had only one jarring moment, and that was the music used when T'Challa meets his father at the Panther tree (for lack of a better nonspoilery description) the first time. I'll probably see this in the theater twice, and I hardly ever see movies more than once on the big screen. Even the minor characters were awesome, and the sweeping shifts in locale were well done. A new classic.",Black Panther,2740

It follow the main premise of the original movie but with a fresh direction and update to engage today's audiences. The parallels orchestrated with cell phones and video gaming were ingenious, while the comedic value and timing were spot on without being just down right stupid. I didn't by any stretch of the imagination intend on seeing this flick in the theatre, so believe me when I say it was an unexpected treat...If u haven't seen it, u don't have a reason not to now...",Jumanji,6582

positive,  Writer and director Alex Garland slowly turns an intriguing premise into an intense and destabilizing science fiction experience that you won't soon forget.,Annihilation,3945
positive,"  Writer and Director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" is awesome. Although, only February ""Black Panther"" is my favorite movie this year. More than just a Marvel superhero translation, ""Black Panther"" shall be Hollywood's reckoning. We all want to to see movies with big ideas, about diverse stories and cultures, and the journey that makes one greater.Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan are amazing as defining others- T'Challa (Black Panther) and Erik Stevens. Heroes like Chadwick have power in their tears, their compassion. Villains like Michael are both lightness and darkness in profound suffering and noble purpose. Theirs is the defining conflict that distinguishes ""Black Panther"" as it touches your heart and inspires your soul.",Black Panther,2566
positive,"  Writer/director Alex Garland has been in the game for quite some time. Writing fantastic movies like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, his knack for filmmaking has always been present but was taken to another level in 2014 when he wrote and directed his first feature film in Ex Machina. Being one of my favorite films of that year, I found myself extremely excited for his next directed project. Annihilation has just hit theatres and if you're not someone who enjoys a slow burn in order to reach a worthy payoff, then this movie may not be for you. If you're up for anything and can embrace any sort of sci-fi story, then here's why I think you'll probably end up loving this movie as much as I did.Going into detail about the plot of this film would truthfully ruin it, so I'm going to explain this premise as simple as I possibly can. After having to deal with a tragic personal incident, Lena tasks herself with a group of women who plan to enter a forcefield area that has been created after a meteor has hit. Learning that they may not all come out alive, they strive forward to find the answers. Yes, that sounds very vague, but it's hard to talk about this movie to someone who hasn't seen it. For a premise like this, you need a few key things to make it work; A great screenplay, a great cast, and a nice through-line of direction to hold the movie together.Annihilation is a film that places its characters first before anything else, and while that definitely works in its favor, if the story surrounding them doesn't work then the overall film will fall pretty flat. Although it takes itself very seriously and many of the scenes are very slow-paced, you can tell that Garland has created a film that will slowly reveal itself as it goes along, providing insight into the backstory of each character as well as providing answers as who what exactly they're trying to uncover. Flashing back and forth between the past and the future, answers are given at the most opportune times in order to benefit the film.Natalie Portman remains a powerhouse when it comes to dramatic performances. I've always been a fan of her in pretty much any dramatic role and this one was no exception. That being said, she's not the only one who shines here. From Gina Rodriguez to Tessa Thompson, each of the supporting members seemed to have their time to shine and certain inciting moments had me on the edge of my seat. There are some truly thrilling moments sprinkled throughout this movie and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I know I'm a sucker for great sci-fi films, but this is just another one to add to the list.In the end, while I can't say everyone will love this movie because I'd be lying if I did, I believe that everyone can at least admire the attempt at being different and unique from most mainstream movies out there today. Annihilation takes risks and doesn't give itself up to a generic conclusion. It chooses to be different from most films and never lets its foot off that peddle. Wonderfully directed, very well-written, and beautiful to look at, I can't really come up with any huge complaints. Yes, some will complain about the pacing and few may even complain about it being too bizarre in its final act, but I found these aspects to be a great addition. Annihilation is a fantastic movie and I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up in my discussion for best films of 2018 at the end of the year. The year is still very young, but I can't recommend this movie enough. Go in with an open mind and you may just love it.",Annihilation,4519
