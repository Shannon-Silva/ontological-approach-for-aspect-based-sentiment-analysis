   "review": "Did not know this gem was hidden way out by the coast. Had driven past it before but never drove in to realize it sits right on the beach and affords private access to the water. They even have swimming pools overlooking the sea! I have not been there before their renovations but I think what they have done with the place is very stylish and classy. There is an airy open feel to the floor plan and the different seating areas make it a welcome entrance. I'd love to just sit by the fireplace with some wine and a book! We dined at Echo and enjoyed the service and the food. I was expecting exorbitant prices given the place is a historical hotel and they just renovated but you'll be surprised they have some very affordable prices. Sometimes we felt the portions were even way larger than the price we were paying - two meals for the price of one almost! Our room was ocean front and beautiful - its gorgeous to wake up to the sunrise over the ocean. Housekeeping ensured some of our specific requests for in-room beverages were taken care of. I only wish they provided microwaves in the room as well (they do have fridges) and moved to proper cups instead of paper glasses for the coffee. I really cant complain, we had a lovely experience staying here and cant wait to go back - this might end up becoming our annual beach vacation. Very close to Atlanta - a half day driving ain't bad and lots to do locally whether you want to be active or relaxed. Thanks King and Prince for a memorable vacation!"
